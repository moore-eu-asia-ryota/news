  <p class="date">11.06.2025</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_0" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Thirty years after the post-revolution boom in accounting outsourcing, the sector faces changes driven by AI and a new generation entering the market. Routine tasks are automated, requiring adaptation from older professionals, and accountants' roles are expanding into data analysis and strategic/tax consulting. A generational shift sees founders retiring, leading to company consolidation for stability. Despite modernization, interest in accounting declines due to complex regulations and continuous learning demands. Firms implement technology to address the shortage of applicants. Outsourcing accounting is becoming increasingly advantageous for companies seeking flexibility and expertise. While automation handles routine tasks, human expertise remains essential for interpretation and client management. The future is hybrid, with AI handling routine tasks while accountants focus on analysis, strategy, and consulting. Adaptation to new tools and skills is crucial for future success in the evolving profession.

**Summary:**

The Czech accounting outsourcing sector, booming post-revolution, is now transforming due to AI and generational shifts. Automation replaces routine tasks, expanding accountant roles towards strategic consulting. Founder retirements drive consolidation. Despite modernization, the profession faces declining interest due to complexity. Firms are adopting technology and outsourcing accounting becomes more attractive for flexibility and expertise. While AI automates tasks, human expertise remains crucial for interpretation. The future is hybrid, demanding new skills for accountants to thrive in an evolving industry.

  <h2>Energy sector still faces a number of uncertainties. The transition to renewable sources is hampered by fees and infrastructure.</h2>
  <p class="date">16.04.2025</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_2" class="summary">
    English Translation:

Despite Europe's shift from fossil fuels to clean energy sources being a key strategy against climate change and energy dependence, the Czech energy sector faces structural and regulatory hurdles. Besides investments and infrastructure, adapting the electricity pricing structure to decentralized renewable energy production is crucial. The Czech Republic committed to the EU's Fit for 55 plan, aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and increase renewable energy to about 30%. Meeting these goals is unlikely for the Czech Republic. While the share of renewables is increasing, coal dependency remains high, and photovoltaic energy dominates renewable sources. The distribution network's limitations and unfavorable energy sharing laws hinder new renewable energy source adoption. Current electricity pricing, designed for centralized production, needs revision to accommodate decentralized producers. Global geopolitics, including the Ukraine conflict, energy crisis, and political factors, drive investments in community solutions and renewable technologies to enhance energy independence. Reducing reliance on external energy suppliers necessitates investments and grid modernization.

Summary:

The Czech Republic faces challenges in meeting EU "Fit for 55" climate goals despite increasing renewable energy usage. Structural and regulatory issues, including electricity pricing ill-suited for decentralized production and distribution network limitations, hinder progress. The country relies heavily on coal, with photovoltaic dominating renewables. Global events are catalyzing investments in energy independence via renewable sources, but grid modernization and revised pricing are crucial for success.

  <p id="summary_3" class="summary">
    British financial regulations are evolving to enhance consumer protection, influencing global financial centers and EU banking sector regulations in the Czech Republic. These changes emphasize customer engagement in product design and leveraging data analysis and AI to improve risk assessment and customer experience. Czech financial institutions are increasingly adopting AI for risk evaluation, fraud detection, and process automation. Concurrently, anticipated interest rate declines are expected to increase lending but may reduce net interest margins. Despite high public trust in Czech banks, the adoption of the European Consumer Credit Directive and discussions around central bank digital currencies further shape the financial landscape.

  <h2>Companies Expect Further Tax Changes in 2025, Construction Industry Will Be No Exception</h2>
  <p class="date">13.03.2025</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_5" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

The beginning of 2025 brought several tax changes affecting businesses in the Czech Republic. Significant amendments were made to the Value Added Tax Act, and the form of tax security was narrowed from financial guarantees to bank guarantees. Further key tax changes will take effect later in the year, some significantly impacting the construction and real estate markets.

Amendments to the VAT Act came into effect on January 1, 2025, primarily affecting mandatory VAT registration. Businesses with annual turnovers exceeding CZK 2 million but not CZK 2,536,500 will become VAT payers from January 1 of the following year. Unlike before, turnover will be assessed for the entire calendar year, not any 12 consecutive months. However, if the turnover exceeds CZK 2,536,500 during the year, the business becomes a VAT payer from the second day after exceeding the limit. This change may cause administrative complications, according to analysts.

Another administrative change is the narrowing of tax security from financial guarantees to bank guarantees to prevent tax evasion. Companies not already using bank guarantees will have to switch, potentially increasing administrative costs.

Effective May 1, 2025, banks, investment companies, and other financial institutions will be affected by a new method of calculating savings periods when transferring long-term investment products (DIP). This aims to increase investor flexibility by allowing them to carry over their savings period when switching providers.

Significant tax changes will also affect the construction and real estate sectors from the beginning of July. For real estate, only the first sale within two years of completion or significant alteration will be taxed; subsequent sales will be exempt. The VAT rate for construction and assembly work on completed residential or social housing buildings will change if the buildings no longer meet the requirements for these types of structures. The goal is to ensure that reconstruction does not have a more favorable tax regime than new construction if the resulting building does not qualify for a reduced VAT rate. The definition of residential buildings for social housing will also change, expanding the possibility of applying a reduced tax rate to their construction.

These changes may significantly impact real estate investors and developers, affecting investment strategies and potentially leading to higher costs for developers and a decreased attractiveness of renovations. However, this could also incentivize new construction projects.

The construction and real estate sectors already faced tax changes at the beginning of the year. The tax now applies only to the part of a forest land containing a protected or special-purpose forest, not the entire plot. The method of tax calculation is also changing, potentially increasing ownership costs. Tax exemptions will be extended to land with ecologically significant features, such as wetlands, orchards, or solitary trees, if registered in the LPIS system. Conversely, land outside built-up areas not registered in LPIS will be taxed at a new, lower rate. Finally, municipalities can now adjust tax coefficients not only generally but also for specific types of properties or locations. Companies should verify if these changes apply to them, as they could result in higher tax liabilities depending on municipal decisions.

**Summary and Refinement (under 150 words):**

Czech Republic's 2025 tax reforms impact businesses across sectors. VAT registration thresholds are changing, potentially causing administrative issues. Tax security now requires bank guarantees, increasing costs for some. May brings new rules for transferring long-term investment products, aiming to boost investor flexibility. July sees significant real estate changes: taxing initial sales within two years of completion, and altered VAT rates for construction based on housing type and renovation versus new build considerations. Forest land taxation and property tax adjustments by municipalities also take effect, urging businesses to verify local impacts. These reforms influence investment strategies and could shift construction incentives.

  <h2>Home Office Has Transformed the Labor Market. Will It Remain Common Practice?</h2>
  <p class="date">26.02.2025</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_6" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

The Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the way we work. Working from home, previously a marginal phenomenon, became a necessity during the pandemic and subsequently a permanent part of the labor market. Now that the world and the Czech economy have stabilized, companies and workers are facing a key question: What is the future of home office? Is this model sustainable, or does it bring risks that can affect the productivity and efficiency of companies?

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the Czech Republic was one of the countries with a relatively low rate of home office use. While in 2019 the average number of employees who worked from home at least occasionally was 16% in the European Union, in the Czech Republic only 10% of employees worked in this way. Remote work was then common for only 5% of Czech workers[1]. However, during the pandemic, this share increased significantly, resulting in a significant and permanent increase in the use of home office. "Before the pandemic, one in twenty employees worked from home, after it was one in ten. This increase suggests that home office has become a permanent part of the labor market in the Czech Republic. However, we are not talking about 100% home office, but about a hybrid model, where in most cases employees work from home for less than half of the working week," says Marcela Hrdá, partner at the consulting group Moore Czech Republic.

This is confirmed by Alena Bičáková from the CERGE-EI economic research department, which published a study on home office in January this year within the Institute for Democracy and Economic Analysis. "People aged 25-44 work from home the most. For them, the increase in work from home increased from 6% to more than 12%. Based on preferences expressed in a survey from January 2023, 66% of men and 70% of women would like to work a few days a week from home, most often two or three. At the same time, it turns out that the size of the company does not play a very large role in the use of home office. The industry of the given job is essential. Home office is logically mainly used in professions that can be performed from home, such as information and telecommunications activities, real estate, finance or insurance," describes Alena Bičáková.

According to a Moore Global study from the end of 2023 among nearly 2,000 executives of medium-sized companies in 12 key world economies, most companies agree that hybrid work increases productivity. Up to 77% of executives stated that their company began to support remote work more after the pandemic, especially in sectors such as IT, finance, real estate and insurance. On the other hand, in industries such as hospitality, tourism and manufacturing, home office is exceptional. Six out of ten respondents then stated that hybrid work has a positive impact on their productivity.

Opportunity for talents from afar

It is no secret that working from home brings a number of benefits for employees and employers. "The main and undeniable benefits certainly include flexibility and the possibility of better balancing work and personal life. The time that employees would spend commuting can be devoted to their families. In addition, if the company has so-called open-space offices, many employees also appreciate the peace and quiet they have at home for work and the associated productivity, because they are less disturbed than in the office. On the other hand, however, home office also brings certain challenges that need to be taken into account," warns Marcela Hrdá. These include the risk of isolation, more difficult communication and cooperation with colleagues, and the potential blurring of the lines between work and personal life.

Some studies also suggest that long-term work from home can lead to a decrease in productivity, especially if clear rules and work structures are not set. "It depends a lot on the communication of the employer's conditions, but also on the discipline of individual employees. The employer must therefore find a system that allows him to effectively measure the results of his employees and at the same time motivates employees to fulfill the set tasks within the home office regime," describes Marcela Hrdá.

From a long-term perspective, however, the increase in the use of home office could lead to greater involvement of mothers of young children in the labor market. An earlier return of women from maternity leave to employment is still a sensitive topic, so the flexibility that home office allows can help. Working from home also allows the involvement of talents from a greater commuting distance, who would not be able to commute to work every day.

The need to set clear rules

Surveys show that many employees would still like to use the option of working from home, at least partially. This approach can bring the best of both worlds - flexibility for employees and maintaining teamwork and corporate culture. However, it is important that companies carefully consider whether home office is suitable for the nature of the work and whether it will reduce the efficiency of employees. The key to successful implementation of the hybrid model is clear communication, setting expectations and providing the necessary tools and support for employees.

Companies should therefore approach the implementation of work from home strategically, taking into account the specifics of their field and the needs of their employees, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability and efficiency of this working model. "According to the experience of our clients, the attitude towards work from home varies. Some companies require a return to the office, allowing their employees home office for one day a week. On the other hand, for example, banks have reduced the capacity of workplaces and do not allow employees to meet all together in the office at all. I therefore believe that home office will remain in the future, but its interpretation and benevolence in setting up the system will be up to individual employers. However, structured parameters can be applied to measure employee results and outputs," adds Marcela Hrdá.

**Summary:**

The Covid-19 pandemic spurred a shift towards home-office in the Czech Republic, increasing its prevalence from 5% to 10% of the workforce. While companies acknowledge benefits like increased productivity (as noted by 60% of respondents in a Moore Global study) and employee flexibility, challenges such as isolation and blurred work-life boundaries exist. Experts emphasize the importance of clear communication, well-defined rules, and effective performance measurement for successful implementation. While some firms are reverting to office-centric models, hybrid approaches are expected to persist, especially in IT, finance, and real estate. Home-office could also enable greater participation of mothers and remote talent.

Laugo Arms, which had a turnover of 12 million euros last year, currently sells around 3,500 hand-made Alien pistols annually, with over 40% of sales in the USA. Both ANACOT CAPITAL and MaeG Investment SICAV aim to significantly enhance the company's growth and market presence.

  <h2>Retraining as an elevator to higher professional and wage levels. Interest is growing, but support is not.</h2>
  <p class="date">05.12.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_10" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Czechs underutilize retraining courses, which are crucial in today's rapidly changing work environment for adapting to digital technologies. While interest is growing, the potential remains untapped. In 2023, only 8.3% of Czechs aged 25-74 participated in retraining in the four months prior to data collection, compared to the EU average of 12.7%. Experts emphasize that higher education and specialization are key to shifting the Czech economy towards a knowledge-based model. Increased employer support could improve retraining uptake, especially for specific age groups. Data from the Czech Labour Office shows a 39% year-on-year increase in retraining participants in the first half of 2024, with nearly half related to digital education funded by the National Recovery Plan. This corresponds with declining demand for low-skilled professions. Retraining is most sought after by individuals with basic education, apprentices, and those with secondary vocational education. Lifelong learning, including other courses and studies, also offers opportunities, with examples ranging from a cleaning lady pursuing a high school diploma to a professional athlete gaining a coaching license. Furthermore, schools are incorporating AI training into their curricula. The Labour Office indicates that over half of retraining participants are aged 35-55, but those over 55 should not be overlooked as they offer experience, a willingness to learn, and loyalty. Flexible work arrangements and training support are vital for this demographic. Overcoming challenges, such as a lack of support or fear of new technologies, is key to success.

**Summary & Refinement:**

Czechs are lagging behind the EU average in utilizing retraining courses, despite their crucial role in adapting to the evolving digital landscape. While interest is growing, only 8.3% participated in retraining in 2023, compared to the EU's 12.7%. Experts stress that increased education and employer support are needed to shift the Czech economy towards a knowledge-based model. Digital skills are increasingly vital, with a surge in retraining participants in 2024 linked to digital education initiatives. Older workers are increasingly seeking retraining. Lifelong learning opportunities, like courses and studies, also offer valuable paths to advancement. Overcoming obstacles like lack of support and fear of technology are vital for individuals embracing lifelong learning.

  <h2>ESG Reporting is Subject to New Rules. Its Form Will Be Shaped by the CSRD Directive From the New Year</h2>
  <p class="date">03.12.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_11" class="summary">
    The European CSRD directive introduces strict new rules for non-financial reporting, requiring companies to provide transparent and auditable ESG data. This aims to create consistent reports enabling stakeholders to assess companies' sustainability performance. Companies must conduct a double materiality analysis, considering their impact on the environment and how external factors affect them. Experts emphasize the need for accurate data, integrating ESG into company strategy, and avoiding greenwashing. Early preparation, including gap analysis, is crucial, as is striving for leadership in sustainability rather than merely meeting legal requirements.

  <p class="date">11.11.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_13" class="summary">
    The Czech Republic is implementing the EU's NIS2 directive with a new cybersecurity law to strengthen cyberattack defenses for businesses and public institutions. A survey by Moore Czech Republic reveals that 72% of leading representatives across sectors like telecommunications, healthcare, and finance are unaware of NIS2. While it expands the scope of affected entities from hundreds to potentially 10,000, including energy producers, hospitals, and government bodies, only 18% fully understand the new law's requirements. A quarter of organizations have a plan for implementation, while common obstacles include funding, expertise, and legislative complexity. However, those familiar with NIS2 view it as an opportunity to enhance trust and cybersecurity, with many already implementing measures like employee training and data backups, but incident response planning remains rare.

  <h2>Companies enter a new era of mandatory ESG reporting. The reason is the CSRD directive.</h2>
  <p class="date">15.10.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_14" class="summary">
    European firms face significant changes in ESG reporting due to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Replacing the NFRD, CSRD expands reporting obligations to all large EU companies meeting two of three criteria: over 250 employees, €50 million+ turnover, or €25 million+ in assets, impacting over 50,000 companies by 2026. Firms must report ESG activities using European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), ensuring data consistency and comparability. CSRD mandates independent verification of ESG data and considers "double materiality," assessing both the impact of a company on the world and how external factors affect the company. While requiring investment in new systems, CSRD enhances credibility with investors, improves reputation, and attracts customers and employees.

  <h2>Amendment to the VAT Act: Promise of Simplification Accompanied by Concerns About Excessive Paperwork</h2>
  <p class="date">28.08.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_15" class="summary">
    The Czech Parliament is resuming discussions on a VAT amendment effective January 1, 2025. Key changes include how VAT registration is calculated. The 2 million CZK threshold remains, but turnover will be assessed annually instead of monthly. Exceeding 2,536,500 CZK (100,000 EUR) triggers immediate VAT registration. Other changes involve evidence of debt payment deadlines, where VAT deductions must be returned if invoices remain unpaid after six months, and construction, shortening the period for taxing first property transfers to two years and redefining "significant construction changes." While intended to simplify processes, experts warn about potential administrative burdens, especially for smaller businesses, due to the complexities surrounding the EU threshold and debt payment tracking.

  <h2>Changes in DPP and DPČ May Negatively Impact Employment Flexibility in the Czech Republic</h2>
  <p class="date">15.07.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_16" class="summary">
    Effective July 1, new regulations impact Agreements to Perform Work (DPP) and Agreements on Work Performance (DPČ) in the Czech Republic. Beyond minimum wage increases and expanded employee rights, employers must now report each DPP to the Czech Social Security Administration (ČSSZ) monthly, even for those below 10,000 CZK. This new reporting obligation, due by the 20th of the following month, increases administrative burdens and costs for companies, potentially discouraging the use of DPPs for flexible staffing. Experts suggest this shift might lead firms to favor full-time contracts or independent contractors. While intended to improve transparency, the change raises concerns about reduced labor market flexibility, particularly compared to other EU nations with higher rates of part-time work and remote work options. Increased support for lifelong learning and flexible work arrangements are recommended to enhance labor market adaptability.

  <h2>Sustainability of energy companies is becoming a priority from the investors' point of view</h2>
  <p class="date">13.06.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_17" class="summary">
    The shift from fossil fuels to renewables is accelerating as investors prioritize sustainability. COP28's support for clean energy pushed major oil and gas companies to commit to near-zero methane emissions by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Companies are investing in energy-efficient technologies and processes, including AI-powered solutions, though achieving these goals remains challenging. The Czech government's Lex OZE II facilitates energy sharing among public entities, households, and businesses, fostering communal energy solutions. Municipalities are developing local energy concepts to optimize energy portfolios, supported by Ministry of Industry and Trade funding. Decentralization allows for more efficient local energy consumption.

  <h2>Despite Significant Property Price Growth, a Real Estate Bubble is Not Threatening the Czech Republic</h2>
  <p class="date">05.06.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_18" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Real estate prices in the Czech Republic have risen significantly in recent years, especially in large cities and their surroundings. This growth is due to a combination of factors, such as insufficient supply of new apartments, lower mortgage interest rates, and growing demand from both investors and those seeking their own housing. New data from Eurostat confirms the extraordinary situation in the Czech real estate market: between 2010 and 2022, apartments and houses in the Czech Republic increased by 126 percent. The average increase in the countries of the European Union is only 47 percent. Eurostat data also shows that rents have also increased, although not as significantly. In the Czech Republic, they rose by more than a third, while the EU average was 18 percent. Czech households spend an average of 19.7 percent of their income on housing, but there is an increasing number of households that pay more than 40 percent of their income for housing. Between 2022 and 2023, their share increased from 10.6 to 13.2 percent. Bedřich Skalický, who specializes in the real estate market at Moore Advisory CZ, says, "Recently, we have seen frequent reports of a real estate bubble and a looming collapse of the real estate market. It is true that real estate prices have risen sharply in recent years, especially in large cities. Demand for real estate remains high, while the supply of new apartments remains limited, which is pushing prices up further." Tomáš Odstrčil, an analyst at the Evropa v datech project, which regularly prepares the Prosperity and Financial Health Index with Česká spořitelna, confirms the poor situation in the Czech market. Although the Czech Republic performs excellently in healthcare and defense compared to other European countries, it lags the most in housing. "The Prosperity Index, in its assessment of the level of housing, takes into account, for example, household expenditures, prices of new buildings, the number of houses and apartments per thousand inhabitants, financial affordability of housing, and the length of construction proceedings. In all of these aspects, the Czech Republic ranked at the bottom of the list last year. And in the case of financial affordability, even in last place," explains Odstrčil. "In the Czech Republic, it takes 14.9 annual salaries to purchase a new apartment. That is more than double compared to Belgium, Denmark, Cyprus, or the Netherlands," he adds. According to Skalický, however, this does not necessarily mean that we are facing a situation comparable to the financial crisis in 2008. "The current Czech market is slowing down rather than heading for a total collapse. Banks are much more cautious in providing loans, mortgage regulations have tightened, and people are more aware of the need to carefully plan their financial possibilities. All of this contributes to a gradual cooling of the market," says Skalický. "This development suggests that while real estate prices may stagnate or decline slightly in the short term, it is unlikely that we will witness a dramatic market crash. It is important to view the real estate market in a broader context and not to forget the factors that contribute to its stability and resilience," he adds. Emotions also play a large role in deciding on future housing, which can be reflected in the overheating of the real estate market. "People looking for their own housing can easily fall into a feeling of frustration. They often wait for real estate prices to fall, thus postponing their purchase decision. However, this strategy may not always be correct. It is very difficult to predict future developments in the real estate market, especially due to unexpected circumstances that can quickly change the situation. Therefore, I would not recommend postponing the purchase of your own housing. Investing in it is a long-term step that should be based on current needs and possibilities, not on speculation about future market developments," describes Skalický. Currently, 78 percent of the population owns their own housing, but even the rest do not want to give up the vision of a safe haven and financial security for the future. Moreover, real estate is a very popular investment, both among Czech and foreign investors. Skalický also confirms that the reality on the current real estate market is complex. Growing demand from those seeking their own housing and investors, which has increased due to lower mortgage interest rates, is facing an insufficient construction of new properties, which is not favored by lengthy legislative processes either. "Demand highly exceeds supply, and we perceive this trend among our clients as well. Interest in investing in housing is constantly growing, which causes an increase in prices and limited availability of quality properties. This situation is evident in large cities and attractive locations, where the interest in buying persists. Given these facts, we recommend potential buyers of their own housing not to wait," adds Skalický.

**Summary and Refinement:**

Czech real estate prices have surged since 2010, outpacing EU averages, driven by limited housing supply, low interest rates, and strong demand. Eurostat data reveals a 126% increase in Czech property prices compared to the EU's 47%. Rents have also risen significantly. Czechs spend a large portion of their income on housing, with an increasing number exceeding 40%. Experts suggest the market is slowing, not collapsing, due to cautious lending and tighter regulations. While prices may stagnate, a crash is unlikely. Delaying home purchases based on speculation isn't advisable. Demand is high, especially in cities, fueled by investor and buyer interest, compounded by slow construction.

  <h2>Economic Analysis by Moore Czech Republic Confirmed the Benefit of Investment in the Ještěd Cable Car</h2>
  <p class="date">30.05.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_19" class="summary">
    Liberec has chosen a single-cabin cable car for the Horní Hanychov-Ještěd route, favored by residents and officials. A study by Moore Czech Republic recommends this "Funifor" system, which uses two ropes, for its long-term economic benefits and ability to operate in adverse weather. While the extended route requires an investment of up to 750 million CZK, with an estimated 15.5-year return, it directly connects to public transport and parking. The cable car, costing around 326 CZK per ride (with discounts for Liberec residents), is scheduled to open in January 2029, following demolition and construction starting in late 2026. The chosen design also allows for a mid-station, boosting tourism.The city is buying the land from Czech railways.

  <h2>Hospitality: Check-in to a year of growth and digital changes. The biggest problem in the Czech Republic is the short length of stay of tourists.</h2>
  <p class="date">16.05.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_20" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Last year, the accommodation sector surpassed its pandemic shadow, with many hotel groups exceeding occupancy and profitability records. This year focuses on technological and digital transformation innovations, especially through sophisticated use of artificial intelligence, which offers new strategies to gain a competitive advantage. In the Czech Republic, where the accommodation sector saw a rise in tourist numbers and overnight stays last year, the sector faces specific challenges such as shorter tourist stays and the need to adapt to new trends like digitization and sustainability.

Globally, the accommodation and leisure services sector had a successful year, with record occupancy and revenues. The industry is moving beyond pre-pandemic comparisons, focusing on new strategies and digital innovations for competitive advantage.

Technological innovations, particularly AI, are key. The sector is moving from simple AI experiments like chatbots to more sophisticated applications, from dynamic revenue management to security and energy management. Major hotel chains are investing millions in AI, with the market expected to reach $8.12 billion by 2033. The Czech Republic is also implementing AI tools to improve customer experience and simplify employee tasks.

Optimistic outlooks are supported by strong demand forecasts, with global business travel spending expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels. "Bleisure" travel, combining business and leisure, is also growing. Investor interest in hotels remains strong due to their ability to dynamically adjust room prices and solid occupancy trends. Major hotel chains have ambitious expansion strategies, focusing on growing regions.

However, uncertainties remain, including geopolitical risks, economic slowdowns, rising costs, and labor shortages. The Czech accommodation sector saw an increase in tourists and overnight stays in 2023, but still hasn't surpassed 2019 levels. Shorter stays and a shift in tourist demographics, with fewer long-stay visitors from Asia, present challenges. Digitalization, sustainability, and personalized services are key, along with state support for tourism.

**Summary and Refinement (under 150 words):**

The accommodation sector rebounded strongly from the pandemic, exceeding pre-pandemic performance in many areas. The focus now is on digital transformation, especially the use of sophisticated AI applications, to gain a competitive edge. While global business and "bleisure" travel are rising, the Czech Republic faces challenges like shorter tourist stays and a lack of long-stay Asian visitors. The sector must adapt to new trends like digitalization, sustainability, and personalized services, while also addressing rising costs and labor shortages. Major hotel chains are investing heavily in AI, projecting significant market growth in the coming years.

  <h2>Despite the labor shortage, Czechs over 55 think finding a job is a problem due to age</h2>
  <p class="date">06.05.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_21" class="summary">
    A survey by MOORE Czech Republic reveals that over 85% of Czechs aged 55+ believe age is a major obstacle in finding employment. Many feel employers fear older workers can't keep up with technology (69.3%) or simply prefer younger candidates (64%). Half believe companies have productivity and motivation prejudices against older workers. Experts urge companies to address these biases, offer flexible work arrangements (desired by nearly 30%), technology training (28.6%), and health programs (21%). While 34% feel their skills are fully utilized, 38% believe they have more to offer. The survey included 600 employed Czechs aged 55+, conducted in April 2024.

  <h2>Sophie's Choice of Automotive Suppliers</h2>
  <p class="date">20.03.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_22" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Recently, it was almost a given that automotive suppliers would shift their production to electromobility. However, investment decisions for production changes are no longer so simple. Leading global automakers are signaling that electric vehicles (EVs) are not the only path they are considering, complicating investment decisions for their suppliers. Faced with stagnating EV sales, many major automotive brands are adopting a more pragmatic approach to the future of the industry, emphasizing that traditional combustion engines will continue to play a role alongside battery power and a wide range of "e-fuels." While EV sales are expected to increase in 2024, differing developments in major automotive markets are prompting caution among manufacturers. The uncertainty is particularly challenging for suppliers, especially those further down the supply chain, who face significant investment decisions regarding the shift to EV component production. This could lead to consolidation among traditional suppliers and potentially foster closer collaboration within the supply chain. This uncertainty could also lead to a new ecosystem, that may allow companies to manage both ICE and EV manufacturing. Czech suppliers also face the challenge of adapting to new trends and investing in electromobility-related innovations and technologies. They also face a lack of qualified labor and pressure to reduce costs.
**Summary:**

Automakers are reconsidering an exclusive focus on EVs due to stagnating sales and the potential of alternative fuels, creating uncertainty for suppliers. Suppliers, especially smaller ones, face difficult investment decisions regarding transitioning to EV component production. Experts predict this could lead to consolidation and closer collaboration within the automotive supply chain, fostering a new ecosystem that can manage both ICE and EV manufacturing, although suppliers also face challenges with labor and cost.

  <p id="summary_23" class="summary">
    Moore Global's analysis highlights key trends for manufacturing and distribution in 2024: AI and advanced analytics for optimized production and data-driven decisions, alongside the risks of over-reliance on digital technologies.  Repatriation of manufacturing is also a strong trend, driven by pandemic-related supply chain vulnerabilities and geopolitical instability, shifting away from "just-in-time" models. AI's impact includes precise customer behavior prediction and strategy modeling, requiring investment in skills development across the workforce.  Financial management is crucial amid high borrowing costs and geopolitical challenges, like Red Sea shipping disruptions. Government incentives are fueling the reshoring trend in the US and Europe, as companies prioritize production closer to consumers.

  <h2>Technology in finance is accelerating significantly, artificial intelligence plays a key role</h2>
  <p class="date">09.02.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_24" class="summary">
    The financial services sector is rapidly adopting AI, machine learning, and blockchain, offering increased efficiency, margins, and reduced customer complaints. However, Moore Global warns that these technologies also present risks that must be understood and mitigated. AI's ability to analyze data enhances fraud detection, personalizes products, and automates tasks, improving customer experience and decision-making. The EU is leading in AI regulation with its AI Act, classifying technologies by risk and imposing limitations. While regulation is necessary, overregulation could stifle innovation and investment. Experts emphasize the need for developers, investors, and regulators to keep pace with the accelerating technological changes in the financial industry to leverage the benefits of AI while managing its potential drawbacks.

  <h2>Community energy can change the Czech Republic</h2>
  <p class="date">24.01.2024</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_25" class="summary">
    English Translation:

The state supports the energy transformation of cities and municipalities. At the end of last year, both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate approved a groundbreaking amendment to the Energy Act, known as Lex OZE II, which opened the way for the development of community energy in the Czech Republic. One of the first steps for cities and municipalities to start community energy is to develop a local energy concept. Significant subsidy support is currently available for this. The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) is financing the support for the development of local energy concepts from the National Recovery Plan. Since December, municipalities can apply for it as part of call no. NPO 3/2024. Applications can be submitted online via the AIS MPO portal until June 30, 2025. According to Tomáš Křapáček, a manager at Moore Advisory CZ, developing a local energy concept helps municipalities gain a comprehensive overview of their territory's energy balance and identify areas where they are most inefficient, which is crucial for accurately targeting energy measures. The collaboration with clients shows that the area of energy has not been strategically addressed for a long time. The rise in energy prices has caused a significant increase in costs, and municipalities must react. It is necessary to have a conceptual solution. Municipalities should consider their energy direction and prioritize their development activities effectively, for example, with regard to return on investment. Municipalities often initially focus on installing solar panels on all roofs. Despite the undeniable positives of photovoltaic power plants, it is not appropriate to narrow down the solution of a complex energy area to just solar panels, it is a shortcut and may not bring the best effects in terms of energy savings or new revenues. Municipalities, or voluntary associations of municipalities, can receive subsidy support of 85 to 95% of the total eligible expenses for the development of local energy concepts, depending on the size or number of inhabitants of the territory concerned. There was so much interest from municipalities in the previous subsidy call that the total financial allocation was increased several times. The development of a concept is of great importance for municipalities. Through them, it is possible to assess the current state in detail, inventory their points of consumption and compile a complete energy balance. A specific feature of local energy concepts is the fact that the energy balance is compiled not only for the municipality's property, but also for the business sector and the household segment. The involvement of the wider public in the preparation of the concept is very important for the necessary deepening of vertical cooperation at the local level. At the same time, it is often the first step towards the creation of community energy, when, based on the data obtained, it is possible to calculate the expected energy and economic impacts of sharing energy flows, as Lex OZE II allows. The creation of associations is currently the number one topic in municipalities, and we use our acquired experience to enable the creation of these local communities in terms of processes, organization and technology, explains Tomáš Křapáček from Moore Advisory CZ. The amendment to the Energy Act called Lex OZE II opens the way for the creation of associations in which public sector entities, households and businesses can share electricity between themselves. According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the decentralization of energy, to which community energy will contribute, will give the public the opportunity to efficiently consume the electricity produced at the local level, or near the place of production. According to the MPO, decentralized energy will complement the existing centralized energy in the coming years, the principle of which is the production of energy from large central sources and its subsequent consumption by a wide range of consumers. Local energy concepts also bring a proposal for energy solutions. In addition to identifying opportunities, the expected amount of investment, the calculation of the impact on the energy balance and operating economy, as well as the evaluation of the total return are defined. This allows municipalities to prioritize their measures and make the right and data-based decisions. The environmental aspect is also not negligible, when in the implementation phase the potential of renewable energy sources is fully and thoughtfully used.

Summary:

The Czech Republic is supporting local energy transformation through subsidies for cities and municipalities to develop local energy concepts, a key step for community energy development under Lex OZE II. Funding from the National Recovery Plan is available until June 30, 2025, via the AIS MPO portal. These concepts help municipalities understand their energy balance, identify inefficiencies, and prioritize energy-saving measures. While solar panels are considered, a holistic approach to renewable energy is encouraged. The initiative promotes local energy sharing among public, private, and residential sectors, aligning with the decentralization goals of Lex OZE II and supporting environmental sustainability.

  <h2>Whistleblower Protection: 42% of Employees Fear Retaliation</h2>
  <p class="date">05.12.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_29" class="summary">
    The Czech Republic's new whistleblower protection law, in effect since August, mandates internal reporting systems for companies with over 250 employees. A Moore Czech Republic survey reveals that only 44% of employees in these companies are aware of this requirement, although 70% are willing to report wrongdoing. Alarmingly, 42% fear retaliation. The survey highlights deficiencies in reporting methods, relying heavily on personal reports and email, and underscores the need for better employee education and awareness of anonymous reporting channels. Companies with 50-249 employees have until December 15th to implement these systems. The lack of awareness and fear of reprisal hinder the law's effectiveness. The survey confirms that most of the employees consider the existence of the system to be important. Moore Czech Republic offers comprehensive solutions to help companies implement these systems and train employees.

    Moore Advisory CZ's analysis for the Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs highlights the need for improved fire safety in residential social care facilities like senior homes. A survey of 153 facilities revealed shortcomings, including 75 multi-story buildings lacking compliant evacuation elevators. While most facilities have multiple escape routes (81%) and fire detection systems (63.4%), fewer have evacuation elevators (47.7%) or fire alarms connected to fire stations. Compared to Germany, Austria, Poland, and New Zealand, Czech facilities need more frequent fire safety training and evacuation drills. Financial constraints hinder improvements, as most facilities are funded by regions and municipalities with limited investment budgets, further impacted by rising energy costs.

  <h2>Unemployment is low, but the Czech economy is struggling. Why do we need foreigners and flexible working conditions?</h2>
  <p class="date">21.08.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_35" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Unemployment in the Czech Republic has been falling for several consecutive months, giving it one of the lowest unemployment rates in the EU. However, this isn't necessarily good news for the Czech economy, which is struggling. The combination of a declining GDP, low unemployment, and a rising number of job vacancies requested by employers is hindering economic recovery and the sustainability of Czech competitiveness. Radovan Hauk from Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the crucial need for the Czech government to facilitate the hiring of qualified foreign workers, including Ukrainians, create conditions for long-term employment, support part-time positions, and retain workers aged 55+. Otherwise, significant problems are predicted.

The number of working people in the Czech Republic is approximately 5.4 million, with a growing proportion of foreign workers, currently one in six. Their largest representation is in manufacturing, followed by administrative and support services. The number of foreign workers has almost tripled in the last 8 years. The demographic trend sees approximately 40,000 people retiring each year, while only about 100,000 millennials enter the workforce. This trend is expected to worsen in the next decade.

The number of unfilled job positions is around 300,000, which may be an overestimation, so the real need of employers is estimated at a range between 280,000 and 300,000 vacant jobs. This hinders the country's economic growth, resulting in a loss of approximately 350 to 375 billion CZK annually (5-5.5% of GDP) in potential GDP and 95 to 105 billion CZK in tax and social security revenues.

Low unemployment and a heated labor market also put pressure on employers to raise wages, although consumer prices rose faster, leading to a real wage decrease. The government should support the employment of foreigners. New trends in digitalization, robotization, and automation will change the requirements for professions and their skills. The state should create programs that will make possibilities more available and increase flexibility of the employment of foreigners.

According to Radovan Hauk, current government programs for employing foreigners are outdated and need to be changed. Programs must be aimed at attracting highly skilled foreigners. The Czech Republic is competing with Germany for workers.

**Summary and Refinement:**

The Czech Republic's low unemployment, while seemingly positive, masks economic challenges including a shrinking GDP and labor shortages. Expert Radovan Hauk warns that the country's competitiveness is at risk without proactive measures to attract and retain foreign workers, support flexible work arrangements, and address an aging workforce. The demographic shift towards more retirees than new workers exacerbates the situation. Unfilled job vacancies cost the Czech Republic billions in lost GDP and tax revenue annually. Hauk urges the government to overhaul its foreign worker programs, focusing on skilled migrants, especially as competition with Germany intensifies. Failure to act could significantly hinder future economic growth.

  <h2>Czech M&A market regains momentum after slowdown, investors focus on company resilience after periods of crisis</h2>
  <p class="date">27.07.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_37" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is increasing again this year. However, investors are more cautious due to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, prioritizing companies' resilience to shocks. Fears of a deep recession have eased, and investors are regaining their appetite for acquisitions, backed by accumulated capital and driven by high inflation. This combination is expected to revitalize the M&A market in the second half of 2023 and early 2024, with a focus on sustainable and diversified business models. Despite 61 transactions in the first half of 2023 (down from previous periods), experts anticipate an increase in activity later in the year. The energy market stabilization and the proven crisis management abilities of companies are also encouraging investments, especially in clean energy. Sectors still facing challenges include energy-intensive businesses and those dependent on foreign supply chains.

**Summary:**

Moore Czech Republic reports a resurgence in M&A activity, with investors prioritizing resilient and sustainable companies after pandemic and war-related caution. Fears of recession have subsided, fueling a renewed appetite backed by accumulated capital and inflation concerns. A market revival is expected in late 2023/early 2024. While overall transaction numbers were down in the first half of 2023, stabilization of energy markets and proven crisis management abilities are encouraging investments, particularly in clean energy. Challenges remain for energy-intensive businesses and those relying on foreign supply chains.

Younger employees (18-26) are most enthusiastic (83%), while interest decreases with age, though even a majority (77%) of those aged 54-65 are agreeable. Men are more skeptical than women. While some European countries are experimenting with four-day weeks with positive results, Czech authorities aren't planning a nationwide implementation, but believe companies could use it to attract workers in a competitive labor market.

    **Translation:**

Dozens of percent of Czechs fear losing their jobs due to artificial intelligence. Experts from Moore Czech Republic are tempering these concerns, predicting that AI will primarily streamline human work rather than replace it. They estimate AI will affect almost all job sectors, especially administration and financial services. AI will also facilitate recruitment processes. Moore Advisory CZ uses AI in recruitment, successfully filling lucrative positions. A Median survey found 31% of Czechs fear job loss due to AI. Miloslav Rut of Moore Technology CZ says AI will undoubtedly replace some jobs but mainly increase efficiency and create new positions. He notes the AI impact will be felt earlier and more strongly in Western Europe and the USA. AI doubles response rates in recruitment for Moore Advisory CZ. AI is used for job descriptions and candidate communication, saving time. Experts believe human contact will still be essential in HR. Moore Advisory CZ also uses AI for text suggestions and process designs in consulting, but emphasizes the need to check AI's outputs for accuracy.

**Summary:**

A survey indicates that 31% of Czechs worry about job displacement due to AI. However, experts at Moore Czech Republic believe AI will primarily enhance work efficiency and generate new roles, particularly in administration and finance. Moore Advisory CZ successfully uses AI in recruitment, improving response rates and candidate quality. While AI automates tasks like resume screening, experts emphasize the continued importance of human interaction in HR. AI also assists in consulting, but requires careful output verification. The impact of AI is expected to be greater and sooner in Western Europe and the US.

  <h2>Taxation of non-financial benefits will put pressure on wage growth. It will also make recruitment more difficult for companies.</h2>
  <p class="date">25.06.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_41" class="summary">
    The Czech government's proposed consolidation package, including limitations on tax-advantaged non-cash benefits, is raising concerns among experts at Moore Czech Republic. They warn that employees view these benefits as part of their compensation, and their removal would trigger wage increase demands, potentially harming the Czech economy and fueling inflation. Eliminating benefits would also make it harder for companies to attract qualified workers in a tight labor market and negatively impact service providers like sports facilities that rely on benefit-driven revenue. The change could affect millions, with experts estimating up to three out of four Czech employees will be impacted. Experts question whether the benefits to the state budget would outweigh the negative economic consequences.

  <h2>Moore Advisory CZ: The state can save up to 337 million annually by adjusting payments for stays in residential social service facilities</h2>
  <p class="date">06.06.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_42" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

A modification of payment conditions for selected residential social service facilities could save the state budget up to 337 million Czech crowns annually. This is according to an analysis by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, prepared by the advisory group Moore Advisory CZ. The survey examined the possibility of co-participation of social service clients in homes for the elderly, homes with special regimes, and homes for people with disabilities, or their relatives, in the costs of care. The analysis shows that 52% of clients in these social service facilities have a person in their vicinity who could contribute to their stay. However, the current willingness to contribute to their loved ones is only at 27%. The project focused on an impact analysis targeting clients of social services in homes for the elderly, homes with special regimes, and homes for people with disabilities. "Based on the assignment of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, we examined the financial possibilities of clients of social service facilities to participate more in covering the expenses related to their stay. The clients themselves often do not have sufficiently high incomes to cover these expenses. In such situations, the law could impose on their relatives an obligation to participate in payments, similar to paying alimony, taking into account their financial possibilities," says Tomáš Křapáček, manager from the advisory group Moore Advisory CZ, adding that the analytical work was based primarily on a questionnaire survey with a thousand clients of social services. The survey revealed that many clients of residential social service facilities have someone in their vicinity who could contribute to partially covering the costs of the social service. In 4 out of 10 cases, the client has a descendant with a maintenance obligation. "The possibility of introducing mandatory payments includes protective limits, both for clients and for persons obliged to pay alimony. Analogously to the current alimony setting, these contributions could not, for example, amount to more than 20% of the residual income, i.e., income after deducting expenses for subsistence. However, the whole situation is so complex that the analysis contains a number of variants and possible exceptions to the payment obligation, taking into account the protection of clients and close persons," explains Tomáš Křapáček. The state can save hundreds of millions. The current situation is that if the client's pension is not high enough, public budgets contribute to the payments. "Relatives currently cover approximately 27% of the difference between full and reduced payment. After the system change, public budgets could save significant funds. However, it should be noted that the financial testing will be linked to the personnel capacities of the public sector, i.e., in addition to income, the planned change would also mean an increase on the expenditure side. According to our calculations, it could be 337 million crowns annually, assuming no other changes," comments Tomáš Křapáček, adding that the average cost of basic services in residential facilities in October 2022 was almost 14,500 crowns per month per client. Inspiration in the West Part of the assignment was to consider the implementation of model parametric schemes as they are set up in Germany and Austria. "Germany can serve as a good example of practice in using private resources to cover the costs associated with providing social services. Children of social service clients there are obliged to contribute to the care, taking into account their property and income possibilities," concludes Tomáš Křapáček.

**Summary & Refinement:**

A Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs analysis suggests modifying payment conditions for residential social services could save the Czech state budget 337 million crowns annually. The study found that while 52% of clients in homes for the elderly and disabled have family who could contribute to their care, only 27% currently do. The proposed changes, inspired by Germany and Austria, would obligate relatives to contribute, similar to alimony, with income-based limits to protect both clients and families. While public budgets currently cover shortfalls, shifting some costs to relatives could significantly reduce state spending, though financial testing would require increased personnel. Average monthly costs per client in these facilities were nearly 14,500 crowns as of October 2022.

  <h2>Main Trends in Finance – Digitalization, AI, and Sustainability</h2>
  <p class="date">30.05.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_44" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Investor interest in fintech startups is declining, according to experts from Moore Global, tempering expectations of revolutionary changes in finance. Many fintech startups have failed to sufficiently monetize their ideas, losing their competitive edge. However, digitalization, including AI solutions, will play a crucial role in the development of the financial sector. Experts at Moore Czech Republic believe the level of digitalization in Czech finance is inadequate. Sustainability is also playing an increasingly important role, gaining traction in the Czech financial sector as well. Moore Global has noted increased M&A activity among fintech startups. Ewen Fleming from Moore Global notes that initial enthusiasm for fintech startups is waning, leading to mergers and acquisitions by corporations. Investor interest remains in more traditional services or underserved regions. Experts say the Czech Republic lags in technology adoption in finance due to a conservative approach from banks and customers. Digitalization is inevitable, accelerated by the pandemic. AI is being used for creditworthiness assessment but is a sensitive topic due to customer preference for human interaction. ESG principles are also gaining prominence, with firms focusing on environmental impact, investment managers building ESG portfolios, and banks focusing on sustainable infrastructure financing. The ESG trend is influencing discussions about the future of Czech building savings, potentially supporting energy-efficient renovations.

**Summary (under 150 words):**

Moore Global reports declining investor interest in fintech startups due to monetization challenges, leading to increased mergers and acquisitions. Despite this, digitalization and AI remain crucial for the financial sector's evolution. The Czech Republic lags in fintech adoption due to a conservative financial culture, but the pandemic has accelerated digitalization discussions. While AI is being implemented, human interaction remains important. ESG principles are increasingly influencing financial decisions, with firms focusing on sustainability and investors seeking ESG portfolios. This trend is evident in discussions regarding future Czech building savings, potentially directed towards energy-efficient renovations.

  <h2>National Qualifications Framework Helps Those Who Want a Better Job. Awareness of it is Increasing</h2>
  <p class="date">22.05.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_45" class="summary">
    The National Pedagogical Institute of the Czech Republic (NPI) conducted a large-scale survey in 2021-2023 as part of the UpSkilling project to assess awareness and knowledge of the National Qualifications Framework (NSK) among schools, labor offices, and employers. The NSK is a state-supported registry of professional qualifications that allows individuals to obtain nationally recognized certifications without formal schooling. The survey, involving nearly 1,000 schools, over 1,400 employers, and 233 labor office employees, revealed high awareness among labor offices (94% knowledge, 79% usage), moderate awareness among schools (77% knowledge, 22% usage), and lower awareness among employers (35% knowledge, 10% usage). Notably, awareness among employers increased between the first and second survey rounds, partly due to UpSkilling workshops. Participants plan to continue using NSK for education, training, and information, but further efforts are needed to increase employer engagement.

  <h2>Whistleblowers save companies money and improve corporate culture. But a reporting system needs to be built now</h2>
  <p class="date">03.05.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_47" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

The delay in implementing the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive in Czech law is complicating matters for both the Czech Republic, which is being sued by the European Commission as a result, and for companies. Without an effective internal reporting system, Czech companies risk significant financial losses, according to experts from Moore Czech Republic. The Czech Republic was supposed to adopt national legislation protecting whistleblowers by December 17, 2021, in accordance with the EU Whistleblowing Directive. The new legislation, in the form of a Whistleblower Protection Act, should protect whistleblowers who report illegal activities within companies. The law will introduce the obligation to create an internal reporting system for companies with more than fifty employees. The system will allow employees to confidentially and anonymously report suspicions of unfair and illegal conduct within the company, which they learned about through their work. Experts warn that firms will panic and search for last-minute solutions when the law comes into force, as it happened with the GDPR. Companies should implement internal reporting systems immediately. Whistleblowing can save billions of euros and help companies prevent financial losses by uncovering illegal conduct, corruption, and other irregularities early. The estimated loss due to the lack of whistleblower protection in the EU is €5.8 to €9.6 billion annually in public procurement alone. Companies that enable and support whistleblowing can uncover problems that would otherwise remain hidden and cause significant damage. Moore Czech Republic offers expert advice and solutions in this area, including secure reporting systems, internal documentation, employee training, investigators, and an EasyWhistle application. It is also crucial to cultivate the discussion of whistleblowing in the public sphere and remove the stigma associated with it, as whistleblowers can contribute to a more open and transparent atmosphere within companies.

**Summary and Refinement:**

The Czech Republic faces EU legal action due to delays in implementing the Whistleblower Protection Directive. Experts warn Czech firms risk significant financial losses without internal reporting systems, required for companies with over 50 employees. Companies need to act immediately to implement these systems. Early detection of illegal activity through whistleblowing can prevent substantial financial damage; EU-wide losses due to lack of protection are estimated at billions. Moore Czech Republic offers support in establishing these systems, emphasizing the importance of a stigma-free culture of transparency.

  <h2>Big Data Will Enable Electricity Production Optimization. Community Power Plants Will Be a New Trend</h2>
  <p class="date">03.05.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_48" class="summary">
    Moore Global experts emphasize ESG principles as vital for energy sector competitiveness. They advocate utilizing big data for optimizing energy production and consumption, citing Temelín nuclear power plant's plan to save 4000 MWh of emission-free electricity. Moore Czech Republic highlights the importance of adapting community power plants for greater sustainability and price stability in the Czech market, potentially covering 25% of national consumption. While renewable energy is boosted by technology and incentives, the energy crisis has led to a temporary increase in fossil fuel use, exemplified by Germany's extended lifespan of thermal power plants. Czech Republic anticipates market transformation through community power plant legislation, enabling peer-to-peer energy sharing and contributing to environmental protection and price stability.

  <h2>Virtual Power Plants Will Transform the Energy Market. In the Future, They Could Produce Up to 25% of Electricity in the Czech Republic</h2>
  <p class="date">30.03.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_50" class="summary">
    Translation:

With proper legislation in place, virtual power plants could become a significant part of the Czech energy system, potentially covering up to 25% of electricity consumption in the medium term, according to experts at Moore Czech Republic. This peer-to-peer energy sharing would be more environmentally friendly and help stabilize electricity prices in the long run. Last year, the Czech Republic experienced the highest electricity price increase in the EU, prompting the preparation of legislation for community energy. Miloslav Rut from Moore Czech Republic estimates the cost of electricity produced in this way to be around CZK 3 per kWh. However, legislation enabling the expansion of virtual power plants is still lacking, with the legislative process expected to begin around mid-year. Rut notes that the development may face distribution network limitations in some areas, necessitating infrastructure reinforcement alongside enabling community energy. He suggests significantly favoring communities operating within a single distribution transformer. Virtual power plants will allow consumers to cover part of their consumption with local renewable energy production. Energy communities will be attractive for municipalities with space for solar panels on public buildings, using this energy for municipal consumption and providing surpluses to citizens or selling them to the grid.

Summary:

Experts believe virtual power plants could cover up to 25% of Czech electricity consumption if proper legislation is implemented. This peer-to-peer energy sharing would be environmentally friendly and stabilize prices. Current legislation is lacking, but the process is expected to start mid-year. Miloslav Rut emphasizes the need for infrastructure improvements to support the expansion, particularly favoring communities using a single distribution transformer. Virtual power plants will enable localized renewable energy consumption, beneficial for municipalities and citizens.

Refined:

Czech experts predict virtual power plants could meet 25% of the country's electricity needs with supportive legislation. This peer-to-peer energy model promises environmental benefits and price stabilization. New laws are expected mid-year, but infrastructure upgrades, especially for communities sharing a single transformer, are crucial. Virtual plants will boost local renewable energy use, benefiting municipalities and residents.

  <h2>Green cities are the future. Prague lags behind other European capitals.</h2>
  <p class="date">18.03.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_51" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to experts at Moore Czech Republic, the development of "smart" and "green" cities will be crucial for the future of urban areas. They note that Czech cities currently lag behind Western Europe in this regard, partly due to inflexible building legislation. A European Environment Agency comparison of green infrastructure in 37 European capitals ranked Prague 20th. However, Prague performs very well in sustainable mobility, ranking 5th globally in the Arcadis index. A green city combines environmental improvements with climate protection in all aspects of urban life. Key areas include energy, particularly using renewable sources and digitalizing energy production and consumption. Smart devices like smart meters and transformers are already being implemented to optimize energy use. The development of smart and green cities will also strengthen inclusion, digital transformation, and risk management. Stricter legislation hinders the progress of Czech cities; Prague's green infrastructure coverage is lower than the European average. While Prague excels in sustainable mobility, inflexible legislation hinders broader "green" development.

**Summary:**

Moore Czech Republic experts emphasize the importance of smart and green city development, where Czech cities currently lag behind Western Europe due to inflexible legislation. While Prague ranks highly in sustainable mobility, it lags in green infrastructure compared to other European capitals. Green cities focus on renewable energy, digitalization, inclusion, and risk management. Bureaucracy hinders the development of Czech cities.

**Refined:**

Czech cities need to embrace smart and green technologies but lag behind Western Europe due to inflexible building regulations, according to Moore Czech Republic. Prague excels in sustainable mobility but needs to improve its green infrastructure. Experts advocate for renewable energy, digitalization, inclusion, and risk management to create future-proofed, environmentally friendly urban environments. Stricter legislations hinder the further development of the country.

  <h2>Consequence of Russian Aggression. Russia's share of total EU exports has fallen by more than half since last February</h2>
  <p class="date">23.02.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_53" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, trade between the European Union and Russia has significantly decreased, impacting both exports and imports. Eurostat data shows Russia's share of EU imports from non-EU countries fell from 9.5% in February 2022 to 5.3% in September 2022. EU exports to Russia dropped from 4% to 1.8% during the same period. The most drastic decline in imports from Russia was in coal, decreasing from 45% pre-war to 13% in Q3 2022. Natural gas and oil imports were halved, with significant reductions also observed in fertilizers, iron, and steel. However, some raw materials like nickel saw increased values. Experts note Russia's importance as an EU trade partner has diminished due to the war and sanctions, affecting energy and other raw material imports. EU exports to Russia now primarily consist of pharmaceuticals, food, and agricultural products not subject to sanctions. The negative impact on the Russian economy is considerable, with experts estimating a potential GDP decline between 10% and 20%, despite official statistics reporting a smaller decrease.

**Summary and Refinement:**

EU-Russia trade has plunged since the Ukraine invasion. Eurostat data reveals a sharp decline in both imports from and exports to Russia. Russia's share of EU imports nearly halved, with significant reductions in coal, gas, and oil. EU exports to Russia also decreased substantially. While some commodities like nickel saw increases, the overall trade relationship has weakened due to sanctions and the war. The shift has impacted the Russian economy, with experts estimating a significant GDP decline, exceeding official figures. Current EU exports to Russia are largely limited to non-sanctioned goods like pharmaceuticals and food.

  <h2>Year 2021 marked by increased energy consumption. Czech Republic recorded the 3rd highest increase in the Union</h2>
  <p class="date">19.01.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_57" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to Eurostat data, the Czech Republic's final energy consumption in 2021 was 3.3% higher than the average for the pre-pandemic years 2017-2019. Only Romania and Bulgaria recorded a larger increase, with Hungary sharing third place. Conversely, final energy consumption decreased in 19 EU countries. Experts from Moore Czech Republic expect a further decrease in consumption across Europe in the coming months due to cost-saving measures by businesses and households driven by high prices. As the Czech Republic has relatively high energy prices, 2022 and 2023 are expected to see a significant decrease in consumption. On average, the European Union saw a 2.1% decrease. Energy consumption mainly increased in Central and Eastern European countries. Malta recorded the largest saving at 10%. The EU's final energy consumption in 2021 reached 968 million tonnes of oil equivalent, exceeding the target set by member states for 2030 by 14.4%.

**Summary (Under 150 words):**

In 2021, the Czech Republic's final energy consumption surpassed pre-pandemic levels by 3.3%, a higher increase than most EU nations. Only Romania and Bulgaria saw greater rises. This contrasts with a 2.1% average decline across the EU, with Malta achieving a 10% reduction. Experts foresee further decreases in Europe due to energy-saving measures driven by high prices, particularly impacting the Czech Republic in 2022-2023. The EU's 2021 energy consumption exceeded its 2030 target by 14.4%, requiring a 2.1% annual reduction to meet the goal of 850 million tonnes of oil equivalent.

  <h2>Digitalization is the future of the financial sector. However, the Czech Republic lags behind.</h2>
  <p class="date">17.01.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_58" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to a recent McKinsey & Company report, 51% of banks have a return on equity lower than the cost of equity. Experts from Moore Global believe this is largely due to slow digitalization, in contrast to the high level of digitalization seen in startups and other progressive financial companies. Digitalization is crucial for the future of financial institutions, and the Czech Republic lags behind Western countries in this area. Fintech startups have begun to rival traditional banks, offering innovative products and services through smart technologies. Ewen Fleming of Moore Global notes the rapid pace of innovation and the unpreparedness of many traditional players, urging banks to rethink their purpose and diversify their customer base. Petr Kymlička of Moore Czech Republic predicts fintech will become increasingly reliant on technology and integrate more areas, while traditional financial institutions will increasingly resemble fintech firms. The Czech financial sector lags behind Western counterparts in technology adoption, with fintech contributing only a small percentage of total revenues due to conservative approaches from banks and customers. However, this is improving due to increasing digital literacy, better technology access, and decreasing language barriers. Furthermore, significant venture capital is being allocated to the fintech sector.

**Summary and Refinement:**

A McKinsey report indicates that over half of banks underperform in return on equity, largely due to slow digitalization compared to agile fintech startups. Moore Global experts emphasize digitalization's importance for financial institutions, noting the Czech Republic's lag in technology adoption. Fintech companies are challenging traditional banks with innovative offerings, driven by technology. Experts predict a blurring of lines between traditional finance and fintech, with technology becoming increasingly crucial. While the Czech Republic's fintech sector lags due to conservatism, increasing digital literacy and investment are fostering progress. Banks need to diversify and innovate to remain competitive in this evolving landscape.

  <h2>Survey among self-employed individuals: The state is creating data mailboxes for them, most of them are expecting it</h2>
  <p class="date">16.01.2023</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_59" class="summary">
    The Czech Republic will establish electronic data mailboxes for all self-employed individuals (OSVČ) and legal entities in the first quarter of 2023, totaling approximately 2.2 million new mailboxes. The state will then exclusively communicate with them through these mailboxes. This transition aims to streamline communication, increase efficiency, and reduce costs, aligning with the digitalization of public administration. Access codes will be sent by registered mail to the address of permanent residence or registered office by the end of March. Experts advise ensuring address accuracy on identification documents, as documents in the data mailbox are considered delivered upon arrival. A survey indicated that 86% of OSVČ were aware of this change.

  <h2>New Flat Tax System: Exceeding the Limit by a Thousand Crowns Could Mean Increased Contributions of up to 120 Thousand</h2>
  <p class="date">15.12.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_60" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

The recently adopted amendment to the Income Tax Act increases the income limit for self-employed individuals (OSVČ) to join the flat tax regime. It also introduces a tiered system where entrepreneurs pay different flat tax amounts based on their income. The Ministry of Finance expects this to increase the attractiveness of the flat tax. Moore Czech Republic experts agree but note the system's complexity may deter potential participants. Keeping income under control will be more crucial for OSVČ. Currently, flat tax adoption is below expectations due to challenging deadlines (January 10th) and delayed tax planning. There are approximately 79,000 flat tax payers out of over 1 million OSVČ in the Czech Republic. While increasing the income limit is positive, the tiered system's conditions may be complicated. OSVČ must determine their applicable tier based on total income and deductible expense percentages (60% or 80%), making it difficult for those with diverse activities. Experts recommend year-end tax calculations with and without the flat tax to choose the most beneficial option, notifying the tax office by January 10th, as differences can exceed CZK 100,000 annually. Transitioning between tiers is possible based on income changes. Falling into a lower bracket allows for a refund. Exceeding the income limit requires a tax payment and tier change or system exit, with a minimum one-year stay in the higher tier. Exceeding the limit by even a small amount can significantly increase payments.

**Summary:**

A new amendment to the Czech Income Tax Act raises the income limit for the flat tax regime for self-employed individuals (OSVČ) and introduces a tiered system with varying tax rates based on income. The Ministry of Finance hopes this will boost flat tax adoption, but experts at Moore Czech Republic warn its complexity may deter some. OSVČ must carefully calculate their applicable tier based on income and deductible expense percentages. Transitioning between tiers is possible with income changes, but exceeding the limit, even slightly, can drastically increase payments. Experts advise year-end tax calculations to determine the most advantageous option.

  <h2>Worsening Financing, Investment Restrictions, and Layoffs. All This Awaits Domestic Businesses in the Coming Months</h2>
  <p class="date">01.12.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_61" class="summary">
    Czech firms face an expected recession, leading to worsened financial results due to record inflation and decreased demand. This may cause investment limitations, and even temporary or permanent business closures. Experts at Moore Czech Republic highlight the need for long-term adaptations in training, digitization, and energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Companies are expected to cut costs, potentially through layoffs and reduced spending. Access to credit will also become more difficult. To stay competitive, firms, particularly those energy-intensive, will need to invest in innovative technologies. Furthermore, companies must focus on higher value activities and development while adapting to demographic changes by upskilling employees and utilizing more flexible employment models. Increased state support for adult education is also crucial for future productivity and economic growth.

  <h2>Companies Emphasizing ESG See Revenue Grow Twice as Fast. Their Stocks Also Perform Better</h2>
  <p class="date">21.11.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_62" class="summary">
    **English Translation:**

Experts from Moore Czech Republic point out that there is insufficient awareness of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) among Czech companies. Companies actively embracing ESG have seen their profits increase by 9.1% in the past three years, 2.5 times the 3.7% increase for those lagging in ESG, according to a Moore Global survey. 84% of firms recognizing the growing importance of ESG reported improved ability to attract external investors. Stock market data confirms this trend, with sustainable stocks yielding about 28% last year, compared to 22.3% overall. The MSCI World SRI index, composed of ESG-active companies, grew 10.11% between 2016 and 2021, 1.7 percentage points more than a comparable non-ESG index. Globally, nearly 80% of large companies see ESG as more important than three years ago, while only 6% are uninterested. In the Czech Republic, however, ESG adoption lags behind Western countries. A Moore Czech Republic survey revealed that only 25% of senior Czech managers are familiar with ESG in their business. While ESG awareness had been increasing, some companies have deprioritized it due to economic concerns. Yet, customers appreciate active ESG approaches, with 89% of ESG-focused retailers better retaining customers. The ESG consulting market is expected to grow significantly due to upcoming legislation, potentially reaching hundreds of millions of crowns annually in 3-5 years. The law will mandate ESG reporting for more companies in 2025, 2026 and 2027, starting with larger publicly traded companies and eventually including listed SMEs.

**Summary and Refinement (under 150 words):**

A Moore Global survey reveals that companies prioritizing ESG principles outperform those who don't, with a 9.1% profit increase versus 3.7%. ESG-focused firms also attract more investors. However, ESG awareness remains low in the Czech Republic, where only 25% of senior managers are familiar with it. While interest in ESG consulting is growing, Czech firms lag behind Western counterparts. New legislation mandating ESG reporting, starting in 2025, is expected to boost the ESG consulting market to hundreds of millions of crowns within 3-5 years, particularly benefitting international consulting firms with extensive ESG expertise.

  <h2>Advantage of the Czech Economy: Small Businesses Account for 35% of Added Value</h2>
  <p class="date">12.10.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_63" class="summary">
    Czech medium-sized firms (50-249 employees) contribute 4% more to added value than the EU average, accounting for 21% of the total. Large companies generate 44%. Experts from Moore Czech Republic consider this balanced distribution across company sizes beneficial for the Czech economy. Small businesses employ 48% of the workforce, medium businesses 19%, and large companies 33%. Despite past suppression of small enterprises, the Czech Republic's current structure is considered successful, outperforming countries like Italy in this regard, although lagging behind Germany. While small businesses are vulnerable to economic downturns, their flexibility allows for rapid replacement without significant unemployment increases, a trend aided by the Czech Republic's low unemployment rate.

  <h2>Czech investments in research and development lag behind the EU average</h2>
  <p class="date">05.10.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_64" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

The average investment per inhabitant in the Czech Republic in 2020 was significantly lower than the EU27 average, at 141.2 euros compared to 244.3 euros. Furthermore, the country experienced below-average year-on-year investment growth last year, increasing by only 1.4% compared to the EU average of 6.3%, according to Eurostat data. Experts from Moore Czech Republic emphasize the crucial role of increased investment in transforming the Czech economy towards higher added value and attracting foreign investors. The state budget is the second-largest source of funding for research and development (R&D), providing one-third of all expenditures in this area in 2020. In the same year, the government allocated 2.1% of the state budget to R&D, a 0.3 percentage point decrease from 2017. Radovan Hauk from Moore Czech Republic points out that while the absolute amount invested in R&D has increased in recent years, its share of the state budget has decreased. He stresses the need to increase investments at a faster pace to attract foreign investors and transform the country from a manufacturing hub to a knowledge-based economy, highlighting the state's role in stimulating private sector investment. Most state R&D expenditures are allocated to knowledge development, particularly within universities and the Academy of Sciences. The Czech Republic faces a growing shortage of qualified workers in technical professions, making it crucial to develop practical skills and closer collaboration between schools and companies. Despite efforts to align with Western and Northern European countries, a significant investment gap remains. However, compared to other former Eastern Bloc countries, the Czech Republic invested 0.64% of its GDP in R&D in 2020, second only to Estonia. It also ranked second in R&D investment per capita, ahead of Slovenia and other Visegrad Group members.

**Summary:**

In 2020, the Czech Republic's per capita investment was significantly lower than the EU27 average. Moreover, the country experienced below-average investment growth compared to the EU average. Experts stress that increased investment is vital for economic transformation and attracting foreign investors. While state budget is the second-largest source of funding for R&D, its share of the budget has decreased despite an increase in absolute amount. Faster investment growth is needed to attract foreign investment and shift towards a knowledge-based economy, highlighting the state's role in stimulating private sector investment. Most state R&D expenditures are allocated to knowledge development, particularly within universities and the Academy of Sciences. The Czech Republic faces a growing shortage of qualified workers in technical professions, making it crucial to develop practical skills and closer collaboration between schools and companies. There's a significant investment gap with Western and Northern European countries. However, compared to other former Eastern Bloc countries, the Czech Republic ranks second in both percentage of GDP and per capita R&D investment.

**Refined Summary:**

The Czech Republic faces a challenge in its investment levels, with per capita figures significantly lagging behind the EU average in 2020. Moreover, its investment growth has been comparatively slow. Experts argue that increased investment is crucial to transform the Czech economy into one driven by high added value and to attract foreign direct investment. The state budget, a major source of R&D funding, has seen its allocation for R&D decrease proportionally, despite overall increases. Radovan Hauk from Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the need for accelerated investment to shift the country from a manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge-based one, stressing the state's catalytic role in encouraging private sector investment. A significant portion of state R&D funds supports knowledge development within universities and the Academy of Sciences. To address a looming shortage of skilled technical workers, stronger links between education and practical experience are vital. Despite efforts to catch up with Western and Northern European investment levels, a considerable gap persists. However, in comparison to former Eastern Bloc nations, the Czech Republic ranks highly in terms of both GDP percentage and per capita investment in R&D.

  <h2>Czech Republic Lags Behind in Artificial Intelligence, Only 4% of Companies Use It</h2>
  <p class="date">06.09.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_66" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

In the Czech Republic, only 4% of companies use artificial intelligence (AI). According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, AI is a key component of the digital transformation of the economy, and it is positive that the state supports AI within the National Recovery Plan. Conversely, the Czech Republic exceeds the European average in the proportion of companies using the Internet of Things (IoT). In the Czech Republic, this share reaches 31%, while the EU average is 29%, according to Eurostat data. The Czech Republic ranks 18th among EU countries in the proportion of companies using AI. Denmark leads this Eurostat comparison with 24%, while Romania has the lowest usage at just 1%.

"The Czech Republic significantly lags behind its European partners in the use of artificial intelligence in business. Modern technologies are very important for economic growth and absolutely essential for maintaining the competitiveness of companies and creating higher added value," comments Marcela Hrdá, partner at Moore Technology CZ.

Modern technologies such as AI and IoT, which is more widely used in domestic companies, are crucial for automation and digitization. These components of the fourth industrial revolution are also important given the state of the domestic labor market, where companies have been struggling to fill thousands of jobs for a long time.

"A wide range of activities in industry can be digitized or automated. Although the pace is slower than in Western Europe, there are many companies that are heading in this direction," says Ivan Konečný, CEO of Misterine, a company dedicated to the development and application of augmented and virtual reality in industry. Along with the involvement of automation and digitization, it is necessary to prepare a system for retraining.

"Gradually, there will be a decrease in jobs with lower qualifications, and therefore lower added value, while it will be necessary to ensure qualifications to operate more sophisticated equipment. It is also necessary to modernize the lifelong learning system and move it into the digital era," adds Ivan Konečný.

According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, digital transformation is one of the priorities of the National Recovery Plan. Projects falling within its framework must meet at least one of the ten so-called digital goals, which include artificial intelligence.

"The fact that the state has included the development of artificial intelligence in the National Recovery Plan is certainly a step in the right direction. I am concerned whether companies have projects in the field of artificial intelligence sufficiently developed and can take advantage of the support," explains Miloslav Rut, a partner at Moore Technology CZ.

"Artificial intelligence can be effectively used in the service sector, where it can largely replace traditional operators of customer support centers and administrative workers. There are many startups in the Czech Republic dealing with this issue," adds Rut, noting that other areas of the economy where AI will have a significant impact on reducing costs, increasing quality, and reducing the share of human labor include industrial enterprises, logistics, and warehousing of goods.

In the Czech Republic, the proportion of companies using the Internet of Things is the 9th highest in the European Union, at 31%. This proportion is highest in Austria, where more than half of companies use the Internet of Things, and lowest again in Romania – with a share of 11%.

"The Internet of Things is used in domestic companies primarily in the areas of warehousing, logistics, and recently IoT technologies have also begun to be used intensively in industry, primarily for collecting technological data. For companies, this is a useful set of tools that can significantly facilitate work and save time and financial costs," explains Miloslav Rut, adding that the use of the Internet of Things is often used to ensure security. According to Eurostat, 72% of companies use it for this purpose, 30% of companies then use the Internet of Things for energy consumption management, and 24% for the maintenance of machines and vehicles.

**Summary:**

The Czech Republic lags behind other European nations in AI adoption, with only 4% of companies utilizing it, placing it 18th in the EU. Denmark leads with 24%. Experts emphasize AI's crucial role in digital transformation and applaud state support through the National Recovery Plan. Conversely, the Czech Republic exceeds the EU average in Internet of Things (IoT) adoption, with 31% of companies using it, ranking 9th in the EU, above the EU average of 29%.

The limited AI use hinders economic growth and competitiveness, especially amidst labor shortages. Automation and digitization, powered by AI and IoT, offer solutions. IoT is primarily used in warehousing, logistics, and industrial data collection, enhancing efficiency and cost savings. As automation increases, workforce retraining is vital to adapt to evolving job requirements, necessitating modernization of lifelong learning. The National Recovery Plan prioritizes digital transformation, including AI, yet concerns remain regarding companies' readiness to leverage available support. AI's potential extends to services, industry, logistics, and warehousing, promising cost reduction and improved quality.

According to the World Tourism Organization, global international passenger transport should increase by 30-78% year-on-year this year. Experts from the Moore Global consulting group point out that there is consolidation in the tourism sector from the perspective of mergers and acquisitions. Better results in the entire sector are hindered mainly by the lack of workforce, which most service providers are struggling with. This accelerates the digitization of services. However, further decline is imminent due to high inflation and the impending economic recession. Due to the pandemic, 62 million tourism employees worldwide lost their jobs in 2020. In 2021, the number of employees increased again, but only by 18.2 million. "After two COVID years, we experienced the first summer that was not marked by anti-pandemic measures. This naturally results in the restart of tourism, although Czechs primarily chose foreign destinations this year. The entire sector struggled with the consequences of the pandemic practically all summer, mainly due to the lack of workforce. This was especially evident in air transport, where the lack of personnel causes an unprecedented number of delayed and canceled flights," describes Václav Škapa, partner of the Moore Czech Republic consulting group. Back in 2019, almost 240,000 people worked in Czech tourism, accounting for nearly 4.5% of total employment. In 2020, a year-on-year decrease in employment of more than 17,000 people was recorded. "The pandemic has changed the Czech labor market beyond recognition, and this is especially true for tourism. A large number of those who lost their jobs have found employment in another field and are no longer willing to return to work in tourism, but also in related fields such as gastronomy, due to the great uncertainty that still prevails in this sector," comments Radovan Hauk, partner of the Moore Czech Republic consulting group. The Rise of Self-Service Hotels According to experts from the Moore Global consulting group, one of the partial solutions to the lack of employees in the tourism sector will be the establishment of automated hotels. "Technology will play a much more important role in the future of hotels. We are likely to see robots in restaurants, more self-service solutions and applications for almost everything. Hotels will use technology as compensation for the 60 million employees that tourism has lost," explains Márton Takács from the Moore Global group. "The future of accommodation facilities is digitization. We are trying to automate simple work tasks that take up our employees' time. They can then devote more time to our guests and be constantly available to them. This year, for example, we opened a new hotel in the center of Prague, which has a self-service reception. In other hotels, guests will meet robots that deliver drinks and food or clean rooms," adds Jiří Fontana, director of business strategy at the hotel chain OREA Hotels & Resorts. Self-service hotels, such as the aforementioned OREA Place Charles Bridge, operate entirely without staff, with the exception of cleaning, which cannot be fully robotized. "Guests order a room in a self-service hotel via the web, and the entire accommodation process from check-in to check-out then takes place online. Even though everything takes place online, we are still in contact with the guest and are able to make their stay more pleasant with full-fledged service. Digitization therefore does not reduce the quality or quantity of services provided. Moreover, the absence of staff reduces operating costs, and therefore the price of the room itself," adds Jiří Fontana. Post-Pandemic Consolidation During the time of pandemic restrictions, access to compensation for losses provided from public budgets was crucial for service providers in the tourism sector. A large proportion of providers did not have savings to bridge the difficult two-year period. "Sufficient financial reserves or capital support from owners were important for maintaining business. The mergers and acquisitions market is now undergoing standard post-crisis consolidation, where the most resilient entities with sufficient capital base are buying up ailing competitors," says Václav Škapa, partner of the Moore Czech Republic consulting group, and adds that space is also being created for the entry of new players. "However, the situation certainly cannot be described as stabilized, so investors are still working with relatively high risk premiums. In addition, the domestic market has its specifics, and the more current influences - rising energy prices and falling real incomes of households - will have longer-term impacts."

**Summary:**

The global tourism sector anticipates a 30-78% year-on-year increase in international passenger transport, according to the World Tourism Organization. The industry is undergoing consolidation through mergers and acquisitions. A significant challenge is the labor shortage, prompting accelerated digitization of services like self-service hotels and robotics to compensate for pandemic-related job losses. The sector lost 62 million jobs globally in 2020, with only a partial recovery of 18.2 million in 2021. While tourism rebounded this summer after pandemic restrictions eased, staff shortages led to flight delays and cancellations. In the Czech Republic, the pandemic caused substantial job losses in tourism, with many former employees not returning due to uncertainty. Automated hotels are emerging as a solution, utilizing technology to replace human tasks. Despite digitization, hotels aim to maintain service quality. Post-pandemic, the industry is consolidating, with stronger companies acquiring weaker ones. Rising energy prices and declining real incomes in the Czech Republic pose further challenges to stabilization.

  <h2>Return to Pre-Pandemic GDP Levels Failing. Czech Republic Fifth Worst in the EU</h2>
  <p class="date">04.08.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_68" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to an analysis by Moore Czech Republic, at the end of 2021, the Czech Republic's GDP only reached 97.8% of its pre-pandemic level from the end of 2019. Ten EU countries have not yet reached their pre-pandemic GDP levels. Only Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Austria experienced worse economic recovery from the pandemic than the Czech Republic.

While seventeen EU countries had GDPs exceeding pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, the Czech Republic was not among them. In 2020, the Czech economy faced the tenth strongest decline in the EU, but in 2021, it showed the fourth weakest growth. Petr Kymlička, a partner at Moore Czech Republic, states that most countries coped better with the pandemic's impact. Several factors contribute to the Czech Republic's unfavorable result, including excessive and chaotic anti-epidemic measures and unsystematic state support. Despite these measures, the Czech Republic has the fourth-highest per capita COVID-19 death rate in the EU.

The government provided various compensations and support to businesses and individuals, but Moore Czech Republic cautions against optimism. These measures primarily aimed to maintain employment, exacerbating the already overheated labor market. This approach missed an opportunity to cleanse the market of inefficient companies, delaying the transformation to a higher value-added economy. Furthermore, fiscal expansion during this period significantly contributed to the dramatic rise in inflation, making the Czech Republic one of the most affected countries.

The analysis reveals that Germany, Austria, and Slovakia are in a similar situation to the Czech Republic, with GDPs below 99% of 2019 levels. Poland is an exception, with its economy growing by 3.6%. Ireland has handled the pandemic best, with its GDP growing by over 20% since the end of 2019, due to targeted and time-limited restrictions. Ireland was the only EU economy to grow in 2020, owing to its knowledge-based economy focused on services and high technology, a high degree of economic freedom, and attractiveness for high value-added foreign investments. Nine EU countries, including Poland and Ireland, experienced a total GDP growth of more than 2% since the end of 2019.

**Summary:**

An analysis by Moore Czech Republic reveals that the Czech Republic's economic recovery from the pandemic lags behind most EU countries. At the end of 2021, its GDP was still below pre-pandemic levels, worse than most EU members except for Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Austria. The Czech Republic experienced a significant economic decline in 2020 and weak growth in 2021. According to Moore Czech Republic, factors contributing to this poor performance include chaotic COVID-19 restrictions and unsystematic state support, which failed to reduce the country's high COVID-19 death rate. While the government provided financial support, it primarily focused on maintaining employment, exacerbating the overheated labor market and delaying the transition to a higher value-added economy. This fiscal expansion also contributed to the country's high inflation rate. Neighboring countries like Germany, Austria, and Slovakia face similar challenges, while Poland has seen growth. Ireland has performed exceptionally well due to targeted restrictions, a knowledge-based economy, and a welcoming environment for foreign investments.

  <h2>Czech local governments are learning to plan better. The United Kingdom is the model</h2>
  <p class="date">19.07.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_69" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to the consulting company Moore Advisory CZ, which tested innovative tools in cities, the strategic planning of regions, cities, and municipalities will undergo dynamic changes in the next 5 years. New strategic planning tools will come to the fore, bringing greater preparedness to local governments and streamlining decision-making processes. This is partly due to growing uncertainties that have created the need to better and more accurately predict the future. In 2021, the total consolidated revenues of territorial budgets amounted to CZK 678.3 billion, with a year-on-year growth of 8.3%. It is no coincidence that the Ministry of Regional Development is interested in strengthening its methodological support in the area of strategic planning. "The vast majority of municipalities, cities, and regions manage their budgets very prudently and strive for long-term sustainability. However, the current situation creates new challenges that need to be addressed at both the national and local levels. In such cases, it is essential to make the right decisions, and therefore our ambition is to provide cities with guidance for better strategic planning through methodological leadership," explains Marie Zezůlková, head of the urban policy and strategy department at the Ministry of Regional Development. The currently ongoing contract under the umbrella of the Ministry of Regional Development aims to test five innovative strategic management tools, which are megatrends, foresight, forecast, scenario planning, and an early warning system, and to create related methodological recommendations and a training module. Strategic planning in the Czech Republic needs to be modernized. A key role in the system of innovative strategic planning is played by foresight. It is a concept that has been systematically developed since the 1960s, but only came to the fore after 1993, when the British government and parliament began to use it massively to create structured ideas about possible variants of future development. Foresight is not a single method, but a set of qualitative and quantitative tools whose sole purpose is to realize in which direction the future may develop in order to be able to prepare for it. "In the field of strategic planning, municipalities, cities, and regions currently require in particular a detailed analysis of the past, which defines their current situation. In some cases, the analytical part accounts for up to 80% of the strategic document, according to the client's requirements. This analysis is certainly key because it serves to understand the basic problems, but it is equally important to conduct structured reflections on the future. Only then will it be achieved that politics will respond to new challenges and will not always act with delay," says Tomáš Křapáček, expert in strategic planning and management from the consulting company Moore Advisory CZ. According to the Methodology for the Preparation of Public Strategies, also issued by the Ministry of Regional Development, the analytical part should constitute approximately 15% of the output. From the above, it is clear that local governments are much more concerned with current states than with focusing on their own strategic development. Cities are open to new approaches. During April and May of this year, a system of the aforementioned innovative strategic management tools was piloted in five Czech cities. First, key megatrends were described in the cities, representing significant and long-term changes in society that have the potential to influence the functioning of the Czech Republic or its parts. Based on this awareness of current trends, other methods were applied to refine the tendencies of future development using qualitative or quantitative tools. In areas where certain states seemed highly probable, the forecast tool was applied, which predicted future developments using statistical models (e.g. in the area of demographic development, availability of groundwater, etc.). In topics where there was greater uncertainty, other tools were applied, such as scenario planning. Scenarios make it possible to think in a structured way about what different combinations of events can occur in the future and how it would be appropriate to react to them. "In our city, when creating scenarios, we focused on events that are uncertain but have a major impact on the lives of our residents, so it is our duty to prepare for them responsibly. For example, in transport, the city's responses were addressed depending on the planned construction of a bypass and possible resumption of mining in the original locations. Although we initially did not know what to expect from the project, this experience will certainly change our strategic work towards the future," explains Jiří Rýdl, mayor of Jablonné v Podještědí. Most often, innovative tools in cities were used to dimension civic amenities (e.g. in relation to the capacity of social services or schools) or technical infrastructure. Support from the national level is approaching. The contract, which is being implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of Regional Development, will run until May of next year. All territorial self-governing units that are interested in the area of strategic planning will be able to familiarize themselves with the results through a methodological recommendation or training programs. "The contract we are participating in shows that this approach is effective and applicable in cities of all sizes. We managed to implement these tools in a town with less than two thousand inhabitants as well as in the seventy thousand Havířov. However, it is necessary to individually adjust the approach according to the size of the city and its specific conditions, and thus also according to the agenda being addressed. The condition of a positive cost-benefit analysis should always apply, i.e. that the benefits from the application of the given tool are higher than the costs incurred, which are expressed primarily by the time of the actors involved," adds Tomáš Křapáček, expert in strategic planning and management from the consulting company Moore Advisory CZ, and concludes: "Better quality strategic planning, which can react in time to future needs, has the potential to increase the efficiency of spending financial resources and ultimately improve the quality of life of residents." About the project Individual outputs of the mentioned project Support for Strategic Management and Planning in Public Administration of the Czech Republic implemented by the Ministry of Regional Development, incl. all other information and documents important for strategic work are continuously published on the Portal of Strategic Work in the Czech Republic (www.verejne-strategie.cz).

**Summary:**

Strategic planning in Czech municipalities, cities, and regions is poised for significant change in the next five years, driven by increasing uncertainty and the need for better future forecasting. The Ministry of Regional Development is actively promoting innovative tools like megatrend analysis, foresight, forecasting, scenario planning, and early warning systems to enhance local governments' preparedness and decision-making. A pilot program in five cities demonstrated the effectiveness of these tools in areas such as civic amenities and infrastructure planning, even in smaller municipalities. While current strategic documents often focus heavily on analyzing the present, experts emphasize the importance of incorporating future-oriented thinking. The Ministry aims to provide methodological support and training to disseminate these new approaches nationwide, with a focus on cost-benefit analysis to ensure efficient resource allocation. The goal is to enable timely responses to emerging challenges, improve the quality of life for residents, and enhance the effectiveness of public spending. Information and resources are available on the Portal of Strategic Work in the Czech Republic.

  <h2>Only a Quarter of Managers Have Heard of ESG. From Next Year, It Will Affect Thousands of Companies</h2>
  <p class="date">22.06.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_71" class="summary">
    A survey commissioned by Moore Czech Republic reveals low awareness of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting among Czech companies, despite upcoming EU directives mandating it from 2023. While 90% of respondents believe in corporate social responsibility and sustainability, only 25% have heard of ESG, and a mere 18% understand its implications and the impending legislation. Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the need for companies to proactively address ESG, viewing it as a strategic advantage rather than a bureaucratic burden.

Although ESG awareness is limited, a significant majority (almost 75%) of informed executives perceive the changes positively, anticipating increased profitability. They also see value in ESG reporting. Experts from Moore Czech Republic see this as a trend toward proactive engagement with ESG for competitive advantage. Banks are already factoring ESG data into lending decisions, impacting financing options and costs.

Moore Czech Republic is actively preparing for ESG audits and is hosting a European meeting in Prague to share best practices across the Moore Global network. The firm urges companies to familiarize themselves with ESG strategies and related legislation to avoid being caught unprepared for the upcoming reporting requirements, which will soon extend to large companies and listed SMEs.

  <h2>The public is not interested in quotas. Less than 25% support their introduction.</h2>
  <p class="date">21.06.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_72" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

A survey commissioned by the consulting group Moore Czech Republic reveals that while six out of ten people believe that a greater number of women in corporate leadership is beneficial, they doubt the authority of women who attain positions through quotas. Support for quotas in elected political offices is around 30%. However, quotas are not a prominent topic among the general public, with 59% reporting they rarely encounter discussions on the matter. Less than a quarter of respondents support quotas for women in leadership positions, with only 20% of men and 30% of women agreeing. According to Marcela Hrdá, partner at Moore Czech Republic, quotas are seen as a marginal issue, and support for them is weak across all age groups and education levels.

Only 12% of women and 8% of men believe that the authority of women in quota-based positions is comparable to that achieved through professional growth. HR Manager Lucie Krejčová suggests that upcoming European legislation could backfire, potentially disrupting succession systems and corporate culture. She also believes that quotas could weaken the natural authority of women in leadership roles.

While respondents generally oppose quotas, a majority (58%) believes that having more women in leadership is beneficial. Marcela Hrdá suggests that instead of quotas, efforts should focus on creating conditions that allow women to balance career and family, such as flexible work arrangements, remote work options, and support programs for childcare. She also emphasizes the importance of education systems that do not reinforce stereotypes. Women currently hold only 29% of managerial positions in the Czech Republic, placing it among the lowest in the EU.

**Summary and Refinement:**

A recent survey by Moore Czech Republic indicates a nuanced public opinion regarding women in leadership and the use of quotas. While a majority recognizes the benefits of having more women in corporate leadership, there's significant skepticism about the authority of women who reach those positions through quota systems. Broad public discourse on quotas is limited, and support for them remains weak across demographics. Concerns exist that quota-based appointments could undermine established career paths and weaken the perceived authority of female leaders. The survey reveals a preference for solutions that enable women to balance their careers and family responsibilities, such as flexible work arrangements and accessible childcare, alongside educational reforms that challenge gender stereotypes. The Czech Republic currently lags behind the EU average in female managerial representation, highlighting the need for continued progress in promoting women's leadership.

  <h2>There is no room for a 2,000 increase in the minimum wage. Nevertheless, companies are adding to it on their own</h2>
  <p class="date">07.06.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_73" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

In addition to rising commodity prices and higher interest rates, companies in the Czech Republic may face another cost threat in the form of forced higher wages. According to experts from the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, this is not the right time for such a significant increase, and it is an unnecessary administrative step in the context of high demand in the labor market. Many employees are already achieving wage increases because companies are raising wages due to the labor shortage. Because of the state of the labor market, where there is a long-term shortage of labor in many professions, companies are forced to add to employees if they do not want to lose them. During the first quarter of this year, the nominal average wage increased by 7.2% year-on-year. Given the rapid growth of consumer prices, it is clear that most workers will not be really better off this year. "Employers are trying to retain their employees by increasing wages so that they do not go to the competition, for example. This is a natural step, as replacing them is either many times more expensive or even impossible," says Radovan Hauk, partner at Moore Czech Republic. Experts from the consulting group Moore Czech Republic point out that although less than 3% of employed people in the Czech Republic work for the minimum wage, the impact of this change would be much wider, as the guaranteed wage also increases with the minimum wage. It sets the lowest possible wage for individual professions, which are divided into eight so-called working groups and ranked according to complexity, strenuousness, and responsibility. "A jump in the minimum wage would hurt especially smaller businesses in industries with lower added value and thus lower margins. For them, this change, along with other external factors such as rising input prices, more difficult borrowing or reduced sales, could be fatal," warns Radovan Hauk, adding that wage growth significantly exceeding labor productivity contributes to the emphasis on digitalization and automation, which often replaces the activities of low-skilled labor. Changes at the European level The minimum wage varies considerably across the European Union. While the highest is in Luxembourg (EUR 2,257) and Ireland (EUR 1,775), the lowest is set in Bulgaria (EUR 332) and Latvia (EUR 500), the Czech Republic is fifth from the bottom with CZK 16,200 (EUR 656). Negotiations are currently underway within the European Union between the European Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament on a proposal for new harmonizing legislation. According to Radovan Hauk, the setting of the minimum wage level should remain fully on the side of the individual Member States. Increases must reflect the state of the economy, the specifics of the national economy, and above all, productivity growth. "A radical increase in the minimum wage, which could result from a possible European Union regulation, would put domestic employers in a difficult situation, it would certainly lead to a loss of competitiveness," he concludes, adding that any legislative harmonization will not affect the six countries that do not have the minimum wage institute at all. These are Denmark, Finland, Italy, Cyprus, Austria and Sweden.

**Summary:**

Czech companies are facing pressure to increase wages amidst rising costs and a tight labor market. While nominal wages rose by 7.2% in the first quarter, real wages are stagnant due to inflation. Companies are raising wages to retain employees, as replacement costs are high. Consulting group Moore Czech Republic warns against a mandated increase in the minimum wage, arguing it's unnecessary given current market dynamics and could harm smaller businesses with low margins. A sharp increase could force further automation and digitalization, displacing low-skilled workers. Minimum wages vary widely across the EU, with the Czech Republic near the bottom. Negotiations are underway for EU-wide legislation on minimum wages. Moore Czech Republic advocates for individual member states to retain control over minimum wage levels, linking increases to economic conditions and productivity. They fear EU mandates could harm Czech competitiveness, especially as some EU countries don't even have minimum wage laws.

**Refined:**

Czech businesses are under pressure to raise wages amid rising commodity prices, higher interest rates, and a fiercely competitive labor market. While nominal wages increased by 7.2% in the first quarter, high inflation is negating any real gains for workers. Companies are boosting pay to retain employees, whose replacement is proving costly and difficult. Consulting firm Moore Czech Republic cautions against a forced hike in the minimum wage, deeming it an unnecessary administrative intervention that could disproportionately affect smaller businesses with lower profit margins already struggling with rising input costs and tighter lending conditions. They argue that significant minimum wage increases, especially if mandated by the EU, could accelerate automation, potentially displacing low-skilled workers and hindering the nation's competitiveness. With minimum wages varying significantly across the EU and harmonization efforts underway, Moore Czech Republic advocates for individual member states to retain control over wage levels, linking adjustments to national economic realities and productivity growth.

  <h2>Abolishing EET is a Step Backwards. The State Should Support at Least a Voluntary Record-Keeping System</h2>
  <p class="date">03.06.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_74" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Share will simultaneously lose the ability to continuously monitor the state of the economy in individual areas of business and regions of the country. Considering the significant investments made by businesses so far, the established public administration apparatus, progress in digitization, and other benefits that electronic sales records (EET) bring, it is appropriate to maintain it, at least on a voluntary basis. The introduction of EET was not entirely painless. This is also evidenced by the fact that even before the outbreak of the pandemic, the evidence did not function fully, after which it was suspended. "By abolishing EET, the government is consciously getting rid of a tool that could help restart tax collection from small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, with minor adjustments, the system could serve as a platform for issuing and storing electronic receipts, thus contributing to a significant shift in the digitization of the Czech economy," says Miloslav Rut, partner at Moore Technology CZ. Support for the modernization of point-of-sale systems and terminals for receiving cashless payments is also one of the current initiatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Czech Chamber of Commerce. Paradoxically, the abolition of the obligation to record sales drastically reduced the share of cashless transactions, because some entrepreneurs again began to prefer unrecorded cash receipts over recorded payment card transactions. Similarly, recording sales helped owners monitor the status of their business on a daily basis and was an effective internal control tool. Last but not least, an increase in the share of the shadow economy can have an impact on the level of legal wages of employees, because the shadow economy logically generates undeclared and untaxed payment of part of wages. From EET to Voluntary EET Experts from the Moore Czech Republic consulting group believe that if the state does not want to force entrepreneurs to keep electronic records, the entire system can be transferred to a voluntary basis and introduce voluntary EET (VEET). "Re-launching the recording of sales in a voluntary mode, associated with a set of benefits and incentives for entrepreneurs, can be a positive signal of how to manage and heal the economy and at the same time solve the country's debt. It would also send a message to honest entrepreneurs and citizens who support such entrepreneurs that such an approach pays off thanks to easy and quick access to economic incentives and simplification of their administration," says Miloslav Rut, adding that recording sales and paying taxes is right and normal for honestly minded entrepreneurs, but they do not want to be pushed into the gray zone by unfair competition avoiding taxation. By supporting at least a voluntary regime of electronic sales records, it is also possible to lay the foundations for the next phase of digitization of the economy, which would concern ordinary business transactions of citizens and streamlining the communication of entrepreneurs with the state in the area of tax returns. Voluntary electronic sales records for the originally planned 3rd and 4th waves can be introduced almost immediately with a minor amendment to the Sales Records Act.

**Summary:**

The abolition of the Electronic Sales Records (EET) system in the Czech Republic is raising concerns about potential setbacks for the economy. Experts argue that scrapping EET means losing a valuable tool for tax collection from small and medium-sized businesses and hindering the digitization of the economy, including the adoption of electronic receipts. Its removal has already led to a decrease in cashless transactions, as some businesses revert to unrecorded cash transactions. Furthermore, EET served as an internal control mechanism for businesses and helped reduce the shadow economy, impacting legal wages. The consulting group Moore Czech Republic suggests transitioning to a voluntary EET (VEET) system, offering incentives and benefits to encourage businesses to continue using it. They believe VEET could aid in economic recovery, debt management, and rewarding honest entrepreneurs. Support for a voluntary system could also pave the way for further digitization, including streamlining tax returns and citizen transactions. A simple amendment to the existing Sales Records Act could facilitate the implementation of voluntary EET almost immediately.

  <h2>Inflation reduces activity in mergers and acquisitions. Investors are changing their decision-making in uncertain times.</h2>
  <p class="date">03.06.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_75" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Of all factors, soaring inflation, rather than rising borrowing costs, has the biggest impact on investors' decision-making. Complex decision-making situations are reflected in the growing interest of companies in acquisition advice. Many sellers are currently considering transactions more carefully or even postponing them. For strategic investors, this approach stems mainly from the overall increase in energy and other input costs, as well as the overall uncertainty in the market. "Due to high inflation, there are obvious concerns that the cash obtained will quickly lose value. This is especially true when real estate is part of the transaction, the market value of which is developing even more dramatically than inflation," describes Petr Kymlička, partner of the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, adding: "Currently, transactions postponed from the pandemic period are being completed. However, this activity will cease by the end of the first half of the year, which will lead to a further weakening of transaction activities in the second part of 2022." More expensive loans also play a significant role. The increase in the price of money also plays a role in the reluctance, but this mainly concerns financial investors. In April, consumer prices in the Czech Republic increased by 14.2% year-on-year. This was the tenth consecutive month in which price growth accelerated. Consequently, the Czech National Bank (ČNB) increased the two-week repo rate by 0.75 percentage points to 5.75%, the highest value since 1999, because in recent years interest rates have been at their historical lows. Transactions were therefore largely covered by bank financing with the addition of investor funds. "Given the current level and expected growth of interest rates, however, transactions are becoming more expensive and investors must take this aspect into account not only in considerations of the financing structure, but also in the investment decision of whether to implement the investment at all," comments Václav Škapa, partner of the consulting group Moore Czech Republic. A realized transaction? It doesn't have to be "won". The problem of increasing the cost of an investment can also concern already realized transactions that are financed through an acquisition loan. "In the case of acquisition loans, banks often work with a floating interest rate on the principle of PRIBOR + margin. If the PRIBOR rate is not secured by suitable hedging instruments, such as an interest rate swap, the rationalization of the investment may be threatened. This applies especially to cases where the general increase in prices is not reflected in an increase in the absolute value of the company's profit, which will decrease in real terms," explains Aneta Milotová, Corporate Finance manager from Moore Avisory CZ, adding that the value of the PRIBOR interest rate increased from 1.11 to 5.36% from last September to this April. From the point of view of investors, the current situation also has a contradictory aspect, as they fear for their funds deposited in bank accounts due to rising inflation. All these factors will have an impact on the structure of transaction financing and related transaction activity on the Czech market in the following months. "We are also seeing changes in our clients, with whom we have recorded up to a 50% increase in interest in acquisition advice since the beginning of the year," concludes Václav Škapa, adding that when looking for suitable transactions, more attention will need to be paid to considerations of the financial performance of the target companies.

**Summary:**

Soaring inflation is having a greater impact on Czech investors' decisions than rising interest rates. This is leading to increased caution among sellers and growing demand for acquisition advisory services. Strategic investors are concerned about rising energy and input costs coupled with market uncertainty and the declining value of cash holdings due to inflation, especially when real estate is involved. The completion of pandemic-delayed deals is expected to slow in the second half of 2022.

Higher interest rates are making transactions more expensive, forcing investors to reconsider financing structures and investment viability. Companies with acquisition loans face risks if PRIBOR rates, which have risen sharply, are not adequately hedged, potentially impacting profitability. Simultaneously, investors are worried about the eroding value of bank deposits due to inflation.

These factors will influence transaction financing and activity in the Czech market. Acquisition advisors are seeing a surge in demand as companies seek guidance, requiring more thorough evaluation of target companies' financial performance.

  <h2>Prices are rising, the limit for Agreement to Perform Work is not. An increase would help vulnerable groups and contribute to the flexibility of the labor market.</h2>
  <p class="date">25.05.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_76" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

This contractual relationship is often entered into by single mothers or pensioners due to its flexibility. The current limit of CZK 10,000 has been valid since 2012, while consumer prices have increased by 38% since then. The increase will motivate employers to create new jobs and employ people in part-time jobs, and will also help many people better cope with the current and expected rapid increase in living costs. The change will help increase the flexibility of the labour market and partially solve the shortage of employees. When working under an agreement to perform work (DPP), an employee who has signed a taxpayer's declaration is not obliged to pay income tax, health or social insurance on earnings up to CZK 10,000. The last increase in this limit occurred in 2012, from CZK 5,000 to the still valid CZK 10,000. For example, the average gross monthly wage has increased by 51% since then, and the minimum wage has increased by as much as 103% in the last ten years. In connection with the increase in consumer prices, the monetary limit for assessing misdemeanours and criminal offences has also recently increased. "Ten thousand crowns had much higher value ten years ago than it does today. This is reflected in a number of areas, but not in the case of agreements to perform work. Therefore, it would make sense to take this into account in the case of increasing the limit, which determines the exception towards social and health insurance contributions and withholding tax," says Radovan Hauk, partner of the Moore Czech Republic consulting group. An increase of CZK 5,000 According to experts from the Moore Czech Republic consulting group, employers and groups of people for whom this type of employment relationship is intended would appreciate an increase in the limit. These are those who are insured by law, i.e. students, pensioners or parents on maternity leave. "Given the increase in inflation and wages since 2012, i.e. since the current limit for taxation with withholding tax for agreements for the performance of work in the amount of CZK 10,000 has been applied, the value of the limit of around CZK 15,000 would correspond to the current economic situation. Increasing the limit will trigger an expansion of job offers for part-time jobs in the form of an agreement for the performance of work on the part of employers," says Radovan Hauk. In addition, the change could at least partially solve the long-term problem of the labour market, which is the excess of vacancies. "Information from our membership base shows that the use of agreements to perform work has been decreasing slightly in recent years, because the limit is too low and is ceasing to make economic sense. Agreements to perform work have always been a useful tool for earning extra money and for gradually getting involved in the work process, whether it was young people during their studies or mothers preparing to return to work after parental leave. Sensibly set agreements also allow employers to cover fluctuations in demand and fulfill orders more quickly that have a limited time period," adds Tomáš Prouza, President of the Czech Republic Trade and Tourism Association and Vice-President of the Czech Economic Chamber. The sooner the better Although an increase in the limit has been discussed in waves for the last few years, according to the Moore Czech Republic consulting group, there has not yet been a more suitable time for this systemic change. Agreements to perform work are used by seniors or single mothers, i.e. representatives of groups most at risk from the current rapid increase in consumer prices. "Increasing the limits would be a significant help for people who work on this agreement. At the same time, there will be increasing demand for employment in the form of a DPP from employees who will be forced to look for secondary jobs in addition to their main employment due to the increase in living costs," concludes Radovan Hauk, adding that the change can at least partially help the domestic labour market.

**Summary:**

The Czech Republic is considering raising the tax exemption limit for Agreements to Perform Work (DPP) from the current CZK 10,000, a figure unchanged since 2012, to around CZK 15,000. Experts argue that the current limit no longer reflects the increased cost of living, as consumer prices have risen by 38% since the last adjustment, while average wages have risen even more. The proposed increase aims to incentivize employers to create more part-time positions, making the labor market more flexible and partly addressing the current labor shortage. This is particularly important for vulnerable groups such as single mothers, pensioners, and students, who often rely on DPP agreements for supplementary income. Raising the limit would provide a crucial financial boost to these individuals, especially amidst rising living costs, and encourage more people to seek part-time work to supplement their income. Additionally, it would allow employers to cover fluctuations in demand more efficiently. The current low limit has caused a slight decline in the use of DPPs as they become less economically viable.

**Refined Summary:**

The Czech Republic is contemplating an increase to the tax exemption threshold for Agreements to Perform Work (DPP), potentially raising it from its current level of CZK 10,000, which has been fixed since 2012, to approximately CZK 15,000. Proponents of the change assert that the existing threshold no longer aligns with the realities of increased living expenses, evidenced by a 38% rise in consumer prices since the last adjustment, and even more significant wage growth. The proposed increase seeks to stimulate the creation of part-time employment opportunities, fostering greater flexibility within the labor market and contributing to the resolution of ongoing labor shortages. This adjustment holds particular significance for vulnerable populations, including single mothers, retirees, and students, who often depend on DPP arrangements for supplemental income. By raising the limit, these individuals would receive vital financial support, particularly in the face of escalating living costs, while also encouraging greater participation in part-time employment. Moreover, it would enable employers to effectively manage fluctuations in demand. The current, inadequate limit has resulted in a minor decrease in the use of DPPs due to their diminishing economic viability.

  <h2>Czech climate protection lags behind the European Union. However, we use railways above average.</h2>
  <p class="date">03.05.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_77" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Data from Eurostat collected between 2009 and 2020 show that Czech households had at least 20% higher energy consumption than the average European household between 2015 and 2019, according to experts from the Moore Czech Republic consulting group. The use of energy from renewable sources has also consistently been below average in the Czech Republic. Simultaneously, the country registers a very small number of zero-emission vehicles. The Czech Republic performs well, however, in statistics related to the use of rail transport. Reducing the impact on the climate is the goal of EU states in connection with the European Green Deal. According to data from the past decade published by the EU statistical office, the Czech Republic fares worse than the European average in many respects.

Worse results, within one of the three pillars, concern household energy consumption, which in the Czech Republic in 2019 amounted to 19.2 GJ per capita, making it the seventh-highest compared to other European countries. The EU average was 14.7 GJ per capita. The Czech Republic also does not perform well in measuring the share of energy from renewable sources in total energy consumption compared to EU states. In 2020, it ranked only nineteenth out of 27 EU countries. Although the Czech Republic lags behind other European countries in the use of energy from renewable sources, there is a noticeable upward trend, with the share of renewable energy use in the Czech Republic increasing from 10.5% in 2010 to 17.3% in 2020. If programs to support these sources are set up correctly, it is likely that we will be able to catch up with the European average in a few years," says Marcela Hrdá, partner at Moore Czech Republic.

The Czech Republic also achieves below-average results in comparing the share of zero-emission vehicles in newly registered passenger cars. Between 2016 and 2020, we never ranked higher than nineteenth. The main reason why the use of electric cars is not yet so popular in the Czech Republic is their high purchase price. Moreover, there is not yet a sufficiently extensive infrastructure for charging. In addition, it should be noted that the vast majority of European states offer some form of fiscal support to users of electric cars. The Czech Republic is not among them," explains Tomáš Křapáček, manager at Moore Advisory CZ. The Czech Republic is above the average of European states in comparisons related to the use of rail transport. Railways transported a total of 9.9% of all passengers in the Czech Republic in 2019, the European average was 8%. In the overall ranking, the Czech Republic was sixth. In Austria, which ranked first, 3 percentage points more passengers used the railway than in the Czech Republic. In rail freight transport, the share in the Czech Republic was 26.2%, 8.6 percentage points higher than the average of the 27 EU countries. The Baltic states took the first three places.

**Summary:**

Recent Eurostat data reveals that the Czech Republic lags behind the EU average in several areas related to the Green Deal. Czech households consume significantly more energy than their European counterparts, and the country's reliance on renewable energy sources remains below par, despite showing an upward trend in recent years. The adoption of zero-emission vehicles is also low, primarily due to high purchase costs and insufficient charging infrastructure, coupled with a lack of government incentives. On a positive note, the Czech Republic performs above the EU average in rail transport, both for passengers and freight. While household energy consumption was seventh highest in the EU, renewable energy use increased from 10.5% in 2010 to 17.3% in 2020. Railway passenger transport reached 9.9% and railway freight transport reached 26.2%, surpassing EU averages.

  <h2>Global marketing technology market exceeded $340 billion last year</h2>
  <p class="date">22.04.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_79" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to experts' expectations, the entire sector will experience significant growth in 2022. Up to 61% of the companies surveyed plan to increase their investment in marketing technologies. According to the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, investments and market growth are already reflected in increased activity in the field of mergers and acquisitions. The marketing technology market mainly consists of tools and software that help with effective marketing. These are most often solutions that help with communication, but also with brand building, data processing and analytics, and the use of social networks. "Brands have a great interest in virtual reality, but also in technologies that help with communication with customers and with sales. Interest in artificial intelligence is also growing," says David Čermák from the Activation Section of the Association of Communication Agencies. The growth of the martech market is mainly due to the transformation of marketing itself, which has been more focused on working with data for several years. "The expansion of digital technologies has been further intensified by the pandemic and the challenges associated with maintaining customers and the growth of some markets. Marketing technologies help to fulfill marketing and business strategies in companies across all sectors, regardless of the size of individual companies," says Marcela Hrdá, partner of the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, adding that the implementation of technologies opens another challenge, which is the development of employees who use them. "The system and processes for employee development will undergo a huge transformation in the coming years, which will change the system of their education and move it to the world of digital technologies, augmented reality and the use of online education elements," adds Marcela Hrdá. Investments will grow. According to the Martech Report, investments in martech accounted for 25% of companies' marketing budgets in 2021. Up to 61% of the surveyed companies plan to increase these budgets, and 30% of these companies want to increase their budgets by more than 10%. "Companies realize that investments in smart technologies are inevitable. Without them, they will lose their competitive advantage. For agencies, it is also an opportunity to expand services to deliver comprehensive marketing solutions to their clients," explains Tomáš Jindříšek, leading partner of the marketing group Digital First Marketing Group. Active M&A market Increased demand for the use of technology in marketing is also evident in the mergers and acquisitions market. American cloud service provider Salesforce bought the Slack platform, which many companies use for mutual communication and work organization, for $27.7 billion. Among the significant transactions of last year was also the acquisition of the software company Intuit, which bought Mailchimp, one of the most used platforms for e-mail marketing, for $12 billion. "After several years of rapid development and growth, the marketing technology market is gradually entering a phase of consolidation. Given that the sector as a whole has great prospects, increased activity in the field of mergers and acquisitions can be expected in the coming years. At the same time, the segment will enjoy increased interest from private equity and venture capital funds, we will probably witness record investments," concludes Petr Kymlička, partner of the Moore Czech Republic group. Martech Report 2021/2022 Czech Republic

**Summary and Refinement:**

The marketing technology sector in the Czech Republic is poised for substantial growth in 2022, driven by the ongoing digital transformation of marketing practices. A significant 61% of companies surveyed plan to increase their investments in marketing technologies, with nearly a third aiming for increases exceeding 10%. This surge is fueled by the need to leverage data-driven strategies, enhance customer communication through solutions like virtual reality and AI, and optimize brand building and social media engagement.

The pandemic has further accelerated the adoption of marketing technologies across various industries and company sizes, as businesses strive to maintain customer relationships and navigate evolving market dynamics. This increased demand is also reflected in a more active mergers and acquisitions landscape. Notable examples include Salesforce's acquisition of Slack and Intuit's purchase of Mailchimp, signaling a trend towards consolidation in the market. Experts predict continued M&A activity and growing interest from private equity and venture capital funds, suggesting a promising outlook for the marketing technology sector in the coming years. A key challenge associated with the adoption of marketing technologies is the need for employee training and development, which is expected to undergo a significant transformation through digital technologies and online learning methods.

  <h2>Up to 60% of organizations require unnecessary consent for personal data processing</h2>
  <p class="date">31.03.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_81" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to experts from the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, 60% of organizations unnecessarily require consent for the processing of personal data, most often public institutions such as schools, kindergartens, and municipalities. Sanctions can be imposed for this overreach. Despite the GDPR regulation coming into effect in 2018, many entities still haven't properly addressed this issue. Moore Czech Republic finds that the most common mistake is requiring consent for data processing even when it's not necessary. Examples include requiring employee consent for using personal data for payroll and HR purposes, which, according to Moore Advisory manager Petr Štětka, is completely unnecessary. Schools also frequently err, often unsure which consents are legally required and which are nonsensical, such as with photography, as not every photo constitutes personal data. Štětka adds that schools also often made mistakes in connection with the processing of personal data with Covid testing. Excessive consent is more often required in the public sector. Petr Štětka also considers consents for the operation of camera systems and consents for the processing of personal data with purchases on e-shops to be problematic. "Generally, however, it can be said that we most often encounter the overuse of consent to data processing in public law institutions. In most cases, this is a mistake due to ignorance," comments Štětka. Although people contact the Office for Personal Data Protection (ÚOOÚ) more often in cases where their personal data is processed without their consent, the office can also impose sanctions up to CZK 10 million for this overreach. "The amount of the sanction then depends on a large number of circumstances, from the extent of the damage to the fact whether the subject has already been sanctioned in the past. Historically, a fine in the order of millions of crowns has so far only been imposed in cases of unsolicited mail," concludes Petr Štětka.

**Summary:**

A study by Moore Czech Republic reveals that 60% of organizations in the Czech Republic, particularly public institutions like schools and municipalities, unnecessarily request consent for processing personal data, potentially leading to fines. This is despite the GDPR regulations being in effect since 2018. Common examples include requiring employee consent for payroll and HR data usage and schools misinterpreting consent needs regarding photography or COVID testing. The over-reliance on consent is often due to a lack of understanding of GDPR requirements. While the Office for Personal Data Protection (ÚOOÚ) typically handles cases of data processing without consent, unnecessary consent requests can also result in penalties up to CZK 10 million. The severity of the fine depends on factors like the scope of harm and prior offenses, with substantial fines historically reserved for unsolicited mail cases. Experts advise organizations to review their data processing practices and only request consent when legally required.

**Refined Summary:**

Many Czech organizations, particularly public sector entities like schools and municipalities, are over-requesting consent for processing personal data, a violation of GDPR regulations that can result in substantial fines. According to Moore Czech Republic, 60% of organizations commit this error, often due to a misunderstanding of GDPR requirements. Common examples include needlessly seeking employee consent for payroll and HR data, and misinterpreting rules around school photography or COVID testing. The Office for Personal Data Protection (ÚOOÚ) primarily addresses data processing without consent, but excessive consent requests are also punishable with fines reaching CZK 10 million, depending on the scale of the violation and the organization's history. Experts advise a thorough review of data processing practices to ensure consent is only obtained when legally required, avoiding unnecessary burdens and potential penalties.

  <h2>Opening to Foreign Workers and Adopting Systemic Changes Will Help the Czech Labor Market</h2>
  <p class="date">11.03.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_82" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to experts from the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, the healthcare, IT, industry, logistics, and gastronomy sectors are most affected. Many employers are also facing an acute shortage of labor due to the return of Ukrainians to their homeland. Therefore, the domestic labor market needs to be revitalized with a number of systemic tools, led by simplifying the employment of foreign workers. "Due to conscription, tens of thousands of Ukrainians had to leave their jobs, which caused short-term critical situations, especially in industrial sectors. Conversely, in the long term, there will be an influx of people who will need to be integrated into the labor process. Soon, the time will come when there will be an urgent need to retrain incoming labor from Ukraine so that Czech companies can offer them jobs. The state must use all the tools at its disposal, including the involvement of the private sector and the use of modular retraining, which will provide the necessary speed and flexibility," says Radovan Hauk, partner at Moore Czech Republic, adding: "Their application, given the current gender composition of incoming Ukrainian refugees, is particularly suitable in sectors such as light industrial production, agriculture, but also services (hospitality, accommodation, cleaning, etc.)." The domestic labor market was not in good condition long before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. In February, the Labor Office registered 263,433 job seekers, while employers offered a total of 363,917 vacancies. "The excess of vacancies over the number of job seekers has persisted since spring 2018. Domestic unemployment has long been at a low level below its natural rate," Radovan Hauk points out. "Financial support from the state during the epidemic was undoubtedly important and appropriate, but in the medium term, the negative consequences of a blanket and excessively generous approach are becoming apparent," Hauk points out, adding that robust fiscal expansion has meant significant public budget deficits, contributes significantly to inflation, the growth of which is among the fastest in Europe in the Czech Republic, and has further paralyzed the domestic labor market. "The shortage of labor is currently even more pronounced in a number of key sectors. In healthcare, industry, and IT, the situation is almost critical," says Radovan Hauk. Higher wages strengthen inflationary pressures The rise in consumer prices is reflected in demands for wage increases, which grew at the sixth-fastest rate in the EU in the third quarter of last year. Pressure for significant wage growth, coupled with a shortage of available labor, further exacerbates the problem of filling job positions. According to the Moore personnel agency, companies are increasingly offering previously unimaginable levels of benefits and "recruitment incentives" when recruiting new employees. "Given the state of the labor market, employees are succeeding in achieving wage increases across almost all sectors. In many sectors, wages are a significant proportion of companies' costs, accounting for half to two-thirds in the case of services and about a quarter in the case of industrial enterprises," explains Radovan Hauk, adding that companies are forced to reflect higher personnel costs in the prices of products and services, which reduces their competitiveness and further fuels inflation. It is high time for systemic changes According to information from the Labor Office, more than 72% of available vacancies are also suitable for foreigners. "It has long been shown that there are tens of thousands of jobs that employers are unable to fill with domestic labor. Greater flexibility, also in the form of accelerated recognition of qualifications or obtaining a work permit, would help to employ incoming Ukrainian workers as quickly as possible. A change should also occur on the side of the Labor Code, for example, in the sense of shortening the notice period, i.e., making the labor market more flexible not only on the side of concluding employment contracts, but also their termination," concludes Radovan Hauk.

**Summary:**

Czech Republic's labor market faces significant challenges, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Sectors like healthcare, IT, industry, logistics, and gastronomy are particularly affected. The return of Ukrainians to their homeland has worsened existing labor shortages. Experts from Moore Czech Republic emphasize the need for systemic changes, including simplifying the employment of foreign workers and accelerating the recognition of Ukrainian qualifications. They suggest retraining Ukrainian refugees for sectors like light industry, agriculture, and services. The Czech labor market already struggled before the war, with more vacancies than job seekers. Government financial support during the pandemic, while initially helpful, has contributed to budget deficits and inflation, further straining the market. Wage increases, driven by rising consumer prices and labor shortages, are adding to inflationary pressures. Moore highlights that over 72% of vacancies are suitable for foreigners, suggesting that easing restrictions on foreign labor, and greater flexibility in the labor code are crucial to address the current crisis.

**Refined:**

The Czech Republic's labor market is under strain, with healthcare, IT, industry, logistics, and gastronomy sectors experiencing acute shortages, which has been further worsened by the war in Ukraine and the subsequent return of Ukrainian workers. Experts from Moore Czech Republic are urging for systemic reforms to streamline the hiring of foreign workers, and accelerate the recognition of Ukrainian qualifications. They advocate for targeted retraining programs for Ukrainian refugees to fill vacancies in light industry, agriculture, and service industries. The domestic labor market was already struggling with more open positions than job seekers before the conflict. While government support during the pandemic initially helped, it has contributed to budget deficits and heightened inflation, thus compounding the labor market’s woes. Rising consumer prices are driving wage demands, which are exacerbating inflation due to companies increasing the cost of goods and services. With over 72% of vacancies suitable for foreign workers, Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the critical need for flexibility in labor laws to facilitate the employment of foreigners.

  <h2>The number of businesses using the cloud doubled in the Czech Republic last year. It was the highest increase in the EU.</h2>
  <p class="date">03.03.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_83" class="summary">
    Cybersecurity experts at Moore Technology CZ are warning that the increasing use of cloud and hybrid solutions for remote work is creating more vulnerable access points and increasing the risk of cyberattacks. In the Czech Republic, 44% of businesses now use cloud services, exceeding the European average. According to Martin Listopad, director of DoxoLogic (part of Moore Czech Republic), the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of cloud technologies, with Czech companies being among the most active in transitioning to the cloud within the EU. This rise is attributed to increased remote work, cost savings, and growing trust in IT.

While cloud solutions offer technological advancements, Miloslav Rut, a partner at Moore Technology CZ, emphasizes the need to address security concerns. Implementing security solutions and monitoring becomes more complex with cloud and hybrid setups, making it difficult to track all activities on the infrastructure. This can lead to identity theft or data breaches. The transition to remote work, facilitated by cloud solutions, introduces vulnerabilities through less secure home offices. Furthermore, the security of the cloud provider's infrastructure itself poses a risk. However, Rut notes that companies prioritizing preventative cybersecurity measures can deflect up to 90% of potential attacks.

  <h2>Standard Ensuring Targeted Online Advertising Deemed Illegal in Belgium. Impacts May Also Occur in the Czech Republic</h2>
  <p class="date">08.02.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_84" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

The current operation of a key technical standard underlying online advertising violates a number of obligations under GDPR, according to a ruling by the Belgian authority. Experts from Moore Legal CZ law firm believe the decision could have pan-European impact. The international standard "IAB Transparency & Consent Framework," intended to legally ensure the operation of personalized advertising on the internet, was found to be inadequate in several aspects in Belgium in early February. According to the Belgian authority, the standard is fundamentally inconsistent with data protection principles. This standard is used by up to 80% of the European internet. "Although this is a decision of the Belgian authority, its significance is pan-European, not only because of the prevalence of the standard but also because of the procedural aspects of the decision itself. The decision was made in accordance with the so-called one-stop-shop mechanism in cooperation with supervisory authorities, which is intended to ensure consistent application of GDPR throughout the European Union. The issuance of the decision was also preceded by the involvement of other so-called affected supervisory authorities, including the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection," says Jan Kubica, attorney and partner at Moore Legal CZ law firm, which is part of the Moore Czech Republic group. The standard is widely used in the Czech Republic, including by major media operators. "This is another in a series of steps that will affect the overall shape of the online environment. In January alone, in addition to the effectiveness of the Czech 'cookie amendment,' several important decisions were issued regarding the transfer of personal data abroad. The possibilities for the continued operation of targeted online advertising based on detailed data analysis are currently an open question," concludes Jan Kubica, adding that IAB Europe now has the opportunity to appeal the Belgian decision in the appropriate court.

**Summary:**

A ruling by the Belgian data protection authority has deemed the widely used "IAB Transparency & Consent Framework," a key standard for online advertising in Europe, to be in violation of GDPR. The decision, impacting up to 80% of the European internet, has potential pan-European implications due to its coordinated nature within the EU's "one-stop-shop" mechanism for GDPR enforcement. This involved other supervisory authorities, including the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection. Experts at Moore Legal CZ highlight the decision's significance alongside other recent developments, such as the Czech Republic's "cookie amendment" and rulings on international data transfers, creating uncertainty about the future of targeted online advertising, and opening a new era of data analysis. The IAB Europe now has the possibility of challenging the Belgian court's decision in court.

  <h2>Cybersecurity Survey of Companies: One in Five Companies Faced an Attack. Only a Quarter Focus on Systematic Prevention</h2>
  <p class="date">06.01.2022</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_85" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Only a quarter of companies surveyed are trying to prevent problems through audits and testing of their IT security. Yet, more than half of companies consider their security adequate. Two-thirds believe it is necessary to devote more attention to cybersecurity than before. Although almost 60% of companies surveyed are completely dependent on computers and internet access, and almost a third are at least partially dependent on them, only half consider their security adequate. "Information and communication technologies are a common part of the operation of most companies. In recent years, the risk of attacks has increased significantly, during which not only can information be misused, but the company can also be completely paralyzed," warns Martin Listopad, director of DoxoLogic, which belongs to the Moore Czech Republic group. Experts warn that the threat of cyberattacks, which can take many forms, should not be underestimated. "Most companies address the issue of cybersecurity reactively, after a problem occurs. The basis is to completely secure access to electronic data as soon as possible and ensure protection against unauthorized manipulation," says Martin Listopad. The survey results show that only a third of companies that have faced a cyberattack in the last 3 years detected the hacking attack in its infancy and eliminated it. "Companies are aware of the risks, with half addressing the topic of cybersecurity at the management level. Roughly two-thirds know that stronger IT protection will require higher investment," says Martin Listopad, adding that investments in prevention are usually significantly lower than the potential costs associated with dealing with an attack. Experts from the Moore Czech Republic consulting group point out that despite widespread awareness of the risks, companies' approach to security against cyberattacks is lukewarm. The survey shows that only a quarter of the surveyed companies are trying to prevent attacks through audits and testing. "If companies pay attention to their cybersecurity preventively, it is possible to avert up to 90% of possible attacks," describes Martin Listopad. Thanks to audits, companies can analyze risks, identify possible threats, determine their vulnerability, and take measures to help manage dangerous situations that would paralyze the company's operations. "Audits also look at ensuring that all processes are set up according to legislative rules and that the company does not face possible sanctions arising, for example, from contractual relationships, but also from the protection of personal data," concludes Martin Listopad.

**Summary:**

A recent survey in the Czech Republic reveals a concerning disconnect between companies' perceived cybersecurity preparedness and the actual risks they face. While a significant majority rely heavily on computers and the internet, only half believe their security measures are adequate. Despite a general awareness of increasing cyber threats, only a quarter of companies proactively conduct IT security audits and testing. Most firms address cybersecurity reactively, after an attack has already occurred, rather than focusing on prevention. Only a third of companies successfully detected and eliminated cyberattacks in their early stages. Experts emphasize that preventative measures, like regular audits, are crucial as they can potentially avert up to 90% of attacks. They warn that the costs associated with dealing with an attack far outweigh the investment in preventative security measures. Furthermore, audits ensure compliance with legal regulations, protecting companies from potential sanctions related to data protection and contractual obligations, in addition to the immediate damage caused by a cyberattack.

  <h2>The number of cyberattacks has almost doubled. People working from home are the most vulnerable.</h2>
  <p class="date">21.12.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_86" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to cybersecurity experts from Doxologic, attackers are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic situation, which has moved a large portion of employees to home offices, making their devices more easily vulnerable. According to Doxologic, part of the Moore Czech Republic group, not only public institutions but also private companies are increasingly becoming targets of cyberattacks. A weak point is the inadequate security of technology when working from home. "End points such as laptops are the gateway to companies and are also the most frequent target of attacks. Through them, attackers can get into entire corporate systems," warns Martin Listopad, Director of Doxologic. "Devices directly in the company are usually protected by advanced technologies for the entire organization. Users are hidden behind imaginary ramparts. Unfortunately, many companies have failed to react and protect users who are not currently behind this imaginary rampart," describes Martin Listopad. Prevention is the basis of security It is important to regularly and purposefully protect yourself and educate employees. "Security policies of organizations should include regular security audits, updating application versions, regular changes to strong access passwords, and building a quality security infrastructure, protecting organizations against attacks on themselves, as well as through their employees working in the field or from home," reminds Martin Listopad. A new trend is so-called triple blackmail A frequent type of attack are so-called ransomware attacks, in which attackers encrypt the data of the affected entity and demand a ransom for decryption. This is the so-called double blackmail technique, which was most evident in the case of the attack on Colonial Pipeline. "A novelty and an increasingly common phenomenon in 2021 is the technique of triple blackmail," says Martin Listopad, adding: "In addition to stealing sensitive data, attackers also target organizations' customers or their business partners, from whom they also demand a ransom."

**Summary:**

Cybersecurity experts at Doxologic warn of increased cyberattacks targeting both public and private entities, exploiting the shift to remote work during the pandemic. Inadequate security measures for home office setups create vulnerabilities, with endpoints like laptops serving as entry points to corporate systems. While on-site devices often have robust protection, remote users are exposed due to companies failing to adapt security measures.

Doxologic emphasizes prevention through regular security audits, application updates, strong passwords, and robust security infrastructure to protect against attacks targeting the organization and its remote workforce. A growing trend is "triple blackmail," where attackers not only encrypt data and demand ransom but also target customers and business partners of the affected organization, further increasing the pressure to pay. This tactic, a progression from the "double blackmail" seen in the Colonial Pipeline attack, represents a significant escalation in cybercriminal strategies.

  <h2>Czech Republic will not approve whistleblowing legislation on time. Nevertheless, some entities must be prepared</h2>
  <p class="date">04.12.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_87" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

New legislation in the form of a law on the protection of whistleblowers should protect whistleblowers who report illegal activities within an organization. According to experts at the Moore Legal CZ law firm, stronger protection for whistleblowers may motivate more frequent reporting of illegal conduct, as they will be better protected against retaliation. However, given the current situation, it is clear that the Czech Republic will not meet its obligation on time, and the law on the protection of whistleblowers will not be approved by the specified date. The aim of the new legislation is to ensure that whistleblowers are protected from possible retaliation and to equalize their procedural position in the event of litigation. Although the draft law on the protection of whistleblowers was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in February this year, only the first reading has taken place. "The discussion was terminated with the end of the electoral term, and it is therefore clear that the content of the directive will not be transposed into Czech law by the deadline. Moreover, it is almost impossible for this deadline to be postponed at the European Union level," says Jan Kubica, lawyer and partner at Moore Legal CZ, adding: "The fact that the Czech Republic fails to implement national legislation and thus fails to meet its commitment on time does not change the continuing obligation to transpose the corresponding legislation into Czech law sooner or later."

Despite this delay, some entities should take note as early as December 17, 2021, the deadline for the adoption of national legislation. Selected provisions of the directive may affect the "state," which is broadly defined in this context. "This category includes not only state institutions and local government bodies, but also entities that perform services of public interest and have certain powers in this regard, such as the State Technical Inspection," warns Jan Kubica, adding that direct effect can only occur with regard to those provisions of the directive that are sufficiently clear, unconditional and precise. In practice, this may mean that after December 17, 2021, regardless of the non-adoption of the law on the protection of whistleblowers, whistleblowers can assert some rights directly under the directive against the "state," and conversely, some employers will be obliged to fulfill obligations arising from the directive.

The new legislation, if adopted in the form previously submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, will bring a number of obligations for so-called obliged entities (employers with at least 25 employees, municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants, public contracting authorities and other selected entities), which, according to the original draft legislation, should have been fulfilled by the end of March 2022. In this regard, however, it depends on the final wording of the law as adopted by the Chamber of Deputies.

In addition to the obligation to introduce an internal reporting system in such a way that it is clear to whistleblowers and does not disadvantage anyone, obliged entities must also have a designated person who will investigate the reports. "The aim is to create a safe and trustworthy environment that will motivate people to use the internal reporting system instead of reporting publicly or directly to the media," describes Jan Kubica. According to him, the most common forms of retaliation include termination of employment/non-extension of a fixed-term contract, changes in working hours, transfer to another job or place of work, ostracism or discrimination against the whistleblower, imposition of disciplinary measures or other similar forms of punishment.

In connection with preparations for the introduction of the new legislation, some entities are already actively preparing a safe environment for whistleblowers within their organization. "Clients are approaching us for assistance with the application of the "whistleblowing directive" in their organization, both from a procedural and organizational point of view, as well as with the setting up of the IT environment in the case of larger organizations that want to create a sufficiently safe and transparent environment for their employees," says Marcela Hrdá, partner at the Moore Czech Republic advisory group.

Those who fail to comply with any of the imposed obligations face a fine of up to one million crowns or even 5% of the net turnover achieved in the last completed accounting period. The relevant person can be fined up to 100,000 crowns. "In addition to the sanction, the obliged entity also exposes itself to the risk of damaging its reputation. Moreover, the proposed legislation gives the whistleblower the right, under certain circumstances, to publish information constituting the content of the report, including the company's trade secret," describes Jan Kubica. The above is especially true if the whistleblower's report is not addressed or an appropriate measure has not been taken within the statutory deadlines.

The status of a whistleblower and the protection associated with this status is directed primarily to the benefit of employees and workers who would like to report harmful conduct that they learned about in connection with their work (or other similar activity). In practice, this is very often harmful conduct by the employer or other employees that they witness. However, the scope of the proposed law is broad and also applies to many other entities. Whistleblowers can thus be, for example, self-employed persons, persons in the bodies of legal entities, trainees, suppliers, job applicants, etc.

**Summary:**

The Czech Republic is late in implementing the EU's whistleblower protection directive into national law, missing the December 17, 2021 deadline. The intended law aims to protect individuals reporting illegal activities within organizations from retaliation and ensure fair legal standing. The delay means the Czech Republic faces potential legal repercussions from the EU. Despite the lack of national legislation, certain provisions of the EU directive might have direct effect on "the state" (including state institutions, local governments, and entities providing public services) from December 17, 2021. This implies that whistleblowers might be able to directly invoke certain rights from the directive against state entities, and some employers will be bound by the directive's obligations.

The anticipated national law will impose obligations on employers with 25+ employees, larger municipalities, and public contracting authorities, including establishing internal reporting systems and designating individuals to investigate reports. Failure to comply could result in fines up to one million crowns or 5% of net turnover, plus reputational damage. The law also allows whistleblowers, under specific conditions, to disclose reported information, even trade secrets, if their reports are not addressed promptly. The legislation seeks to protect a broad range of individuals, including employees, contractors, and job applicants, who report harmful conduct witnessed in connection with their work.

  <h2>Many organizations still haven't properly addressed GDPR. The most common mistake is unnecessarily requiring consent.</h2>
  <p class="date">30.11.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_88" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Despite the impossibility of precisely quantifying the number, experts from the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, which manages personal data for nearly 300 organizations, warn that many of them face sanctions. From the outset, the regulation was accompanied by many fears, causing many unnecessary mistakes that increase the administrative burden. Three years after coming into effect, many ambiguities still surround the GDPR regulation. According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, data processing concerns a vast number of fields, and many entities still frequently make mistakes in complying with the legislation. The most common mistakes include processing an excessive amount of data, unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and sending unsolicited commercial communications. "During my practice, I have not yet encountered intentional breaches of personal data security. Unfortunately, even unintentional breaches, such as the loss or accidental destruction of data, could lead to sanctions, even if all other processes were set up correctly," says Petr Štětka, manager at Moore Advisory. By April 30, 2021, the Office for Personal Data Protection (ÚOOÚ) had received 1065 notifications of serious breaches of obligations in the processing of personal data. However, only 12 fines were imposed, totaling over half a million Czech crowns. The largest fine was 180,000 crowns. Besides unintentional errors, Moore Czech Republic notes gross violations, such as unmarked camera systems, insufficient information about personal data processing, and excessive consent requests. "Many organizations require consent where it is not necessary, unnecessarily adding to the administrative burden for themselves and their clients," says Petr Štětka, with the most typical example being human resources and consent for processing personal data for payroll and personnel purposes. In this case, processing is required by law. Website and e-shop operators have made the biggest progress in data protection in the last three years. However, according to Petr Štětka's experience, a significant portion is still not oriented in current legislation, leading to the aforementioned mistakes. "During Covid-19 testing, the operator of a testing site had a mistake in the form, which also addressed personal data protection issues - it referred to an invalid law on personal data protection. This is a sign that the organization does not have GDPR properly processed, its data protection officer is not functioning, or it does not even have one," he points out, adding: "Similar shortcomings can be easily removed in cooperation with an entity that has been dealing with GDPR for a long time." Experts attribute the current state partly to a lack of attention and communication from the state. The GDPR regulation was approved in April 2016 and came into effect in May 2018. According to experts from Moore Advisory, there was enough time for awareness. "Underestimating the information campaign meant unnecessary panic, both for personal data processors and the public," says Štětka. He calls the fact that the Czech adaptation law was approved almost a year after the GDPR regulation came into effect unfortunate. "This plunged the private and public sectors into uncertainty. The so-called fearmongers also contributed to the negative perception, presenting to us, with exaggeration, that after the introduction of GDPR, we would almost not be able to shake hands with someone and introduce ourselves without first signing consent," Štětka concludes. The GDPR regulation has had minimal impact on the average citizen.

**Summary:**

Despite three years since the GDPR's implementation, many Czech organizations continue to struggle with compliance, facing potential sanctions. Moore Czech Republic reports common errors including excessive data processing, unauthorized disclosure, and unnecessary consent requests. Unintentional data breaches are also a concern. While the Office for Personal Data Protection has received over a thousand breach notifications, only a small number of fines have been issued. Experts note that website and e-shop operators have made progress but often still fail to comply with current legislation, referencing outdated laws. The lack of adequate state communication and a delayed Czech adaptation law contributed to uncertainty and unnecessary panic. Some organizations unnecessarily require consent, creating an administrative burden. The GDPR's impact on average citizens remains minimal.

**Refined Summary:**

Three years after GDPR's enactment, many Czech organizations still struggle with compliance, risking sanctions, according to Moore Czech Republic. Common violations include excessive data processing, unauthorized disclosure, and requiring unnecessary consent, highlighting a misunderstanding of the regulation's scope. Even unintentional data breaches pose risks. Despite numerous breach notifications, the Office for Personal Data Protection has issued few fines. While website and e-commerce operators show improvement, many still fail to update their practices, referencing obsolete data protection laws. Experts attribute these issues to inadequate government communication and the late adoption of Czech GDPR adaptation laws. This lack of clarity fostered uncertainty and unnecessary fear. The overzealous pursuit of consent in areas where it's not legally required has added to the administrative burden for both businesses and individuals. Despite the initial anxieties, GDPR's impact on the everyday citizen remains minimal.

  <h2>Government investment in research and development has increased significantly, but the Czech Republic is still below the EU average</h2>
  <p class="date">15.11.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_89" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Despite significant growth in recent years, the Czech Republic's spending on research and development (R&D) reached €128 per capita in 2020, significantly lagging behind the EU average. According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, maintaining the trend of funding R&D is crucial for the country's transformation into an advanced, high-value-added economy. In 2020, total government R&D spending in the EU exceeded €100 billion, a 22% increase compared to 2010. Eurostat data shows that the Czech government's R&D budget increased by €42.7 per capita over ten years. Despite this 50% growth, the Czech Republic ranks 15th out of 27 EU member states. Karel Kučera, partner at Moore Czech Republic, emphasizes that investments in R&D are essential for transforming the Czech economy into a smart economy and the positive trend of the last decade must be sustained. He argues that these investments are particularly effective during economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate private sector investment.

Private R&D investment in the Czech Republic is also below average. According to the Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic, nearly 60% of its 1,600 member companies reduced their science and research budgets, with only a quarter increasing them. Kučera attributes this to a lack of incentives for businesses to invest and suggests an optimal mix of tax breaks, project funding assistance, and collaboration support. He proposes modifying the National Recovery Plan to encourage private sector investment and collaboration with universities, even if some projects face implementation delays.

Domestic R&D investment as a percentage of GDP has shown promising growth, starting at 1.33% in 2010 and approaching 2% in recent years, despite slowdowns in 2015 and 2016. However, this figure remains below the EU average of 2.2% in 2019. Kučera notes significant variations in R&D investment across countries, with Nordic countries, Austria, and Germany leading, while Southern and Eastern European countries allocate the least. Within the Visegrád Four, the Czech Republic leads in R&D investment.

**Summary:**

The Czech Republic's investment in research and development is growing but still lags behind the EU average, both in government and private sector spending. While government R&D expenditure has increased significantly over the past decade, the country ranks 15th in the EU. Experts emphasize the critical role of R&D investment in transforming the Czech economy into a smart, high-value-added one, particularly during post-pandemic recovery. A lack of incentives hinders private sector investment, with many companies reducing their R&D budgets. Proposals include optimizing tax breaks and funding support, and modifying the National Recovery Plan to promote collaboration between businesses and universities. Although the share of R&D investment in GDP is increasing, it remains below the EU average. The Czech Republic leads the Visegrád Four in R&D investment but trails behind leading EU nations like those in Scandinavia, Austria, and Germany.

  <h2>Completely Abolishing EET Doesn't Make Sense. Supporting at Least Voluntary Registration is Offered</h2>
  <p class="date">01.11.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_90" class="summary">
    According to experts at Moore Czech Republic, abolishing the Electronic Records of Sales (EET) would be a mistake, as it would eliminate a valuable tool for allocating subsidies based on recorded revenues and for monitoring economic conditions across various business sectors and regions. They argue that considering the significant investments already made by businesses, the established public administration infrastructure, and the progress in digitalization, EET should be retained, at least on a voluntary basis, through a minor legislative amendment.

The political battle and opposition to the current government have presented a challenge to the forming coalition. Miloslav Rut, a partner at Moore Technology CZ, believes that abolishing EET would deprive the future government of a tool to revitalize tax collection from small and medium-sized enterprises. He suggests that with minor adjustments, EET could serve as a platform for issuing electronic receipts, promoting digitalization. Furthermore, implementing EET in the 3rd and 4th waves would modernize cash register systems, including enabling card payments.

The experts propose transitioning to a voluntary EET system (DEET), incentivizing businesses to participate by offering easier access to subsidies and improved conditions for digitalization investments. This approach would reward honest businesses and signal a new era of respect, support, and appreciation from the state. Simona Hornochová, a tax advisor, notes that a draft amendment for voluntary EET already exists, making implementation possible with political will. The current government introduced EET at the end of 2016 with the goal of improving tax collection and fairness.

  <h2>9 out of 10 ICT professionals in the Czech Republic are men. Attracting more women makes sense</h2>
  <p class="date">25.10.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_91" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Experts from Moore Technology point out that although the Czech Republic has recorded the largest increase in the number of women in the ICT sector in the EU over the last decade, it is still among the four countries with the smallest representation, along with Latvia, Slovenia, and Belgium. Conversely, the most balanced ratio is in Denmark, where women make up 33% of the ICT workforce. This is according to current Eurostat data. With the rise of the digital age, interest in experts in the field of information and communication technologies is growing. In the last ten years, the number of people educated in ICT in the EU has increased from 2 million to 2.9 million, a rise of 45%. According to statistics, 2.7 million of them also worked in this profession. Men have an increasingly dominant representation in this sector. "According to the latest Eurostat data, the representation of men in ICT has increased by 3 percentage points from 80 to 83 percent since 2010," says Miroslav Rut, partner at Moore Technology, which is part of the Moore Czech Republic group. Women in ICT grew at the fastest rate in the Czech Republic. In recent years, several initiatives have emerged in the Czech Republic to support women in the ICT sector, yet the ratio of men to women is still significantly unbalanced. In terms of relative growth, the Czech Republic ranked first in the EU over the past decade with 20.7%. The increasing involvement of women in the world of ICT is also confirmed by data from the Czech Statistical Office; in 2010, only 11.5% of university students in ICT fields were women, while in 2020, it was already 17%. "It is right that there are programs and initiatives trying to attract more women to the world of information and communication technologies. Increasing their number in the field is difficult also because ICT is perceived by women as a male domain. More women are welcome in ICT, and their greater involvement can at least partially help solve the shortage of labor in this field," says Marcela Hrdá, partner of the Moore Czech Republic group, adding that the number of job vacancies in the field has significantly exceeded the number of qualified experts for several years. "Given that the ICT sector is usually financially rewarded above average, greater female involvement can also reduce the difference in average earnings between men and women," she adds. Gender gap across the EU. Nevertheless, according to Eurostat data, the Czech Republic is still among the worst countries in the share of women in ICT, along with Belgium, in a shared 4th place from the bottom of the list. Despite improvements in recent years, women in the domestic ICT sector make up only 11%, with only Slovenia (10%) and Latvia (6%) faring worse. Conversely, there are 5 countries where women make up at least a quarter of the ICT workforce, led by Denmark with 33% representation.

**Summary:**

While the Czech Republic has seen the EU's largest growth in women in ICT over the past decade (20.7%), the country still ranks among the lowest in female representation in the sector, at 11%, alongside Latvia, Slovenia, and Belgium. Denmark leads the EU with 33% female participation in ICT. The overall number of ICT-educated individuals in the EU has risen significantly (45%) in the last ten years. Men's representation has increased slightly (3%) to 83% since 2010. Despite growing initiatives to support women in ICT in the Czech Republic and a rise in female ICT students (17% in 2020 compared to 11.5% in 2010), a gender imbalance persists. Experts emphasize that increasing female participation is crucial for addressing labor shortages in the well-compensated ICT field and reducing the gender pay gap. While some EU nations lag, others, like Denmark, have achieved more balanced gender representation in their ICT workforces.

  <h2>Call-offs as a scarecrow for subcontractors in the automotive industry. Existential problems may arise in as little as a quarter of a year</h2>
  <p class="date">14.10.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_92" class="summary">
    Czech industrial production fell by 1.4% year-on-year in August, with the automotive sector experiencing a significant decline of over 28%. Moore Czech Republic predicts that some subcontractors could face existential threats within the next three to four months, and expects normalization no sooner than the end of the first half of next year.

Extended lead times for chip orders, reaching 21 weeks (the longest since 2017), signal persistent shortages hindering automotive production. Petr Kymlička from Moore Czech Republic emphasizes that improvements are not expected in the coming weeks. AlixPartner estimates a global shortfall of 7.7 million vehicles, costing the automotive industry over 4 trillion Czech crowns due to the chip crisis.

The impact of order suspensions cascades through the supply chain, where "just in time" production methods prevail, minimizing storage costs. Subcontractors heavily reliant on the automotive sector face significant challenges, prompting them to diversify their customer base. However, this shift is financially, technically, and logistically demanding. Some manufacturers are using employer-initiated downtime to reduce costs, but this must be managed carefully to avoid employees seeking alternative employment. Solutions until mid-2023 may involve delivering vehicles with temporarily unavailable non-essential features.

  <h2>Exclusive survey: 2/3 of companies and entrepreneurs do not expect restrictions from the state for the rest of the year</h2>
  <p class="date">16.09.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_94" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

66% of companies are not preparing anti-epidemic measures for the rest of the year unless ordered or recommended by the government. Companies that voluntarily implement preventive measures most often test employees and allow work from home. Companies are not afraid of another wave and the associated business restrictions. 65% of the 315 company representatives surveyed do not expect state authorities to interfere with their business. "The reason is the optimistic mood from the summer, when the epidemic was receding. Another factor is confidence in vaccination, after all, some companies motivated their employees to get vaccinated with, for example, a day off or a financial reward," describes Marcela Hrdá, partner at the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, and adds: "Although certain restrictions still apply, companies have learned to function with them within individual sectors and believe that they will not be tightened." The fact that optimism prevails in the business sphere is also confirmed by surveys conducted by the Czech Chamber of Commerce. "According to available information, there is no indication that companies and entrepreneurs will be restricted to the same extent this autumn as last year. Vaccination as an effective tool against the disease is available to everyone, so there is no reason to introduce any blanket or sectoral restrictions. We will strive to ensure that any problems are resolved in a timely manner and without significantly limiting the services provided," adds Zdeněk Zajíček, Vice President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce. Only 1/3 of companies are preparing. According to the survey, 66% of companies are not preparing anti-pandemic measures for the rest of this year unless ordered or recommended by the government. "Most companies follow basic rules, urging compliance with 3R (wear a mask, keep distance, wash hands). Only a third of companies are implementing or planning protective measures beyond this framework. Employee safety is also protection of their business. Therefore, in some companies, employees still work divided into groups that do not meet," says Marcela Hrdá. The survey for Moore Czech Republic also showed that a quarter of companies that are preparing anti-epidemic measures for the rest of the year rely on testing. To a similar extent, they allow work from home. "It is interesting that almost half of the companies that expect restrictions from the public administration are not preparing for such a situation in any particular way," concludes Marcela Hrdá. The survey was conducted from September 2nd to 7th among 315 private entrepreneurs, directors, top managers, and senior managers in the service, manufacturing, industry, retail, and agriculture sectors. Companies of all sizes, from 1 to 1,000+ employees and with a turnover from less than 1 million crowns to more than 1 billion crowns.

**Summary:**

A recent survey of 315 Czech companies reveals that the majority (66%) are not planning additional anti-epidemic measures for the remainder of the year, unless mandated by the government. This optimism stems from a receding epidemic over the summer, confidence in vaccinations, and the belief that current restrictions will not be tightened. While most adhere to basic hygiene guidelines (masks, distance, handwashing), only a third are implementing further protective measures, such as employee testing and remote work options. Notably, a significant portion of companies anticipating potential government-imposed restrictions are not actively preparing for them. The Czech Chamber of Commerce echoes this optimistic outlook, citing widespread vaccination as a reason to avoid blanket or sector-specific limitations on businesses, and pledging to address issues proactively without hindering service provision.

**Refined Summary:**

Most Czech companies (66%) are not planning extra anti-epidemic measures for the rest of the year unless the government orders it, fueled by summer's receding epidemic and faith in vaccinations. A third are actively using testing or remote work. Surprisingly, many firms expecting restrictions aren't actively preparing. The Czech Chamber of Commerce shares this upbeat view, arguing vaccination negates broad business limits, vowing to solve problems without disrupting services.

  <h2>Below-average GDP growth in the second quarter. The Czech economy is recovering more slowly than the vast majority of EU countries</h2>
  <p class="date">23.08.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_95" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

This is not an isolated fluctuation – the Czech Republic has recorded worse growth or decline than the EU average for four consecutive quarters. This is according to an analysis of current Eurostat data conducted by the consulting firm Moore Czech Republic. Not only the European Union as a whole, but also the Czech Republic returned to economic growth in the second quarter. "The year-on-year quarterly growth of 7.8% is significant at first glance, but it must be realized that the base of last year's second quarter was significantly affected by the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, this was the case in virtually all European countries, of which the Czech Republic reported the second-lowest rate of economic recovery in the last three months," points out Petr Kymlička, partner at Moore Czech Republic. The European Union recorded an average year-on-year growth of 13.2% for the same period, with as many as ten countries reporting double-digit growth. "The Czech Republic has been showing worse economic development than the EU average since the third quarter of 2020. In the second quarter, the aforementioned slower growth, and in the previous three quarters, a more significant year-on-year quarterly decline," notes Petr Kymlička, adding that Eurostat data is not yet complete, as data from 7 EU member states – Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Croatia, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia – are missing. The Czech economy also showed a lower growth rate than the EU average (1.9%) in a quarter-on-quarter comparison, growing by only 0.6%, making it the fourth slowest. According to the analysis by Moore Czech Republic, the cause of this development can be seen mainly in the differentiated impacts of the coronavirus crisis and in the ways of solving it. The significant dependence of the domestic economy on the automotive industry, which is affected by a fundamental disruption of supply chains, in combination with rising input prices and a long-term shortage of labor slows down the pace of its growth.

**Summary:**

The Czech Republic's economic growth has lagged behind the EU average for four straight quarters, according to an analysis by Moore Czech Republic based on Eurostat data. While the Czech economy experienced a 7.8% year-on-year growth in the second quarter, this was comparatively low, ranking second-to-last among European nations. The EU, in contrast, saw an average increase of 13.2%, with ten countries achieving double-digit growth. This underperformance began in the third quarter of 2020. The Czech economy's quarter-on-quarter growth was also lower than the EU average, at only 0.6%. Moore Czech Republic attributes this trend to the differential impacts and management of the COVID-19 crisis. The country's reliance on the automotive industry, which is heavily affected by disrupted supply chains, coupled with rising input costs and a persistent labor shortage, is cited as a key factor slowing economic growth. Data from seven EU member states remains incomplete in the Eurostat report.

  <h2>Czech industry's performance in June was above the EU average. Better results are hampered by a shortage of workers and inputs.</h2>
  <p class="date">15.08.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_96" class="summary">
    Czech industrial production saw above-average growth within the EU context in June 2021, both month-on-month and year-on-year. According to Eurostat data, Czech industrial output increased by 1% compared to May 2021, while the EU average saw a slight decline of 0.2%. Malta experienced the most significant growth at 5.2%, followed by Slovakia at 2.9%. However, countries like Denmark, Ireland, and Finland faced declines of 2% or more.

Year-on-year, EU member states averaged a growth of 10.5%, with the Czech Republic exceeding this at 11.4%. Petr Kymlička from Moore Czech Republic noted that while European industrial production is slowly returning to pre-pandemic levels, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages continue to hinder Czech companies. Despite these challenges, the Czech Republic recorded double-digit year-on-year growth in June, a feat not achieved by all EU countries, with 11 nations experiencing single-digit growth, particularly in the Nordic region. Experts believe Czech industry is still performing below its potential due to persistent labor and material input constraints.

  <h2>Czech debt growth was the second highest in the EU in the first quarter. Only Cyprus increased its debt more.</h2>
  <p class="date">28.07.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_97" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to the consulting company Moore Czech Republic, the main cause of the increased debt was the poorly managed COVID-19 epidemic situation. The Czech Republic's debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 37.8% in the last quarter of 2020 to 44.1% at the end of March this year. During this period, 23 out of 27 EU member states increased their government debt. However, only Cyprus recorded a more significant quarterly increase in government debt (6.5 percentage points). "The COVID-19 pandemic peaked in the Czech Republic in the first quarter, and at one point we were among the most affected countries in the world. Increased spending on combating the pandemic and, in particular, restrictions limiting the full operation of the economy are the main reasons for the above-average growth in public debt," says Petr Kymlička, partner at Moore Czech Republic. Slovakia has one of the lowest rates. Despite the difficult period affected by the global pandemic, some EU members managed not to increase their public debt. "Slovakia, which also faced the strongest wave of the pandemic in the first quarter, maintained its debt from the last quarter of last year at 60.3% of GDP," comments Petr Kymlička, adding that expenses related to the pandemic and the decline in economic performance for the same reason are not the only causes of the increase in debt in the Czech Republic. "The decline on the revenue side associated with the abolition of the super-gross wage was crucial. We must also not forget that we are facing elections this year, and in such a period there is usually no room for reducing government debt," he adds. Despite the above-average quarterly growth, the Czech Republic is among the countries with the lowest debt. "If there is no systematic consolidation of the state budget in the coming years, we will most likely move up the ladder of the most indebted countries," comments Petr Kymlička. Such an indication came with the results for the first quarter of this year. Lithuania and Denmark managed to reduce their debt-to-GDP ratio (by 1.5 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively), and Denmark replaced the Czech Republic as the fifth least indebted country in the EU. Source: Eurostat

**Summary:**

The Czech Republic experienced a significant increase in its debt-to-GDP ratio in the first quarter of 2021, rising from 37.8% to 44.1%. According to Moore Czech Republic, this surge was primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased spending to combat the virus and economic restrictions. While most EU countries saw their government debt increase, only Cyprus had a more substantial quarterly rise. The Czech Republic's increased debt was also attributed to the abolition of the super-gross wage, reducing government revenue, and the upcoming elections, which typically discourage debt reduction measures. Despite this increase, the Czech Republic remains among the least indebted EU countries. However, without systematic consolidation of the state budget, its ranking is likely to decline. Lithuania and Denmark even managed to reduce their debt ratios, with Denmark surpassing the Czech Republic as the fifth least indebted nation in the EU. While Slovakia managed to maintain its debt level during the same period. The Czech Republic's position in the rankings may be at risk without fiscal adjustments.

  <h2>Mortgage Rates Continue to Rise. Czech Republic Approaching Top Ten EU Countries with Highest Average Rate</h2>
  <p class="date">27.07.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_98" class="summary">
    Czech Republic is likely to join the top 10 EU countries with the most expensive mortgages. Latvia, Hungary, and Romania currently lead with rates above 4%, while Eurozone countries boast rates often around 1%, with Finland offering the lowest at 0.8%. In contrast to last year's historical lows, mortgage rates in the Czech Republic, currently averaging 2.42%, are among the higher ones in the EU. Experts predict further increases due to the Czech National Bank's repo rate hikes. Currently, the Czech Republic ranks 11th in the EU for average mortgage rates, trailing the Netherlands by a mere 0.09 percentage points. However, with Dutch mortgage rates decreasing, the Czech Republic is expected to move into the top 10. Slovakia has one of the lowest rates in EU. Latvia (5%), Hungary (4.4%), and Romania (4.39%) have the highest mortgage rates, while Finland (0.80%), Portugal (1.00%), and Slovakia (1.09%) have the lowest. All of Czech Republic's neighboring countries have lower average rates. The disparity is largely attributed to Eurozone membership and market competition. Rising mortgage costs are further diminishing housing affordability for Czechs, despite homeownership being exceptionally popular.

  <h2>Antivirus Shutdown Did Not Translate to Unemployment. Programs Helped Save 100,000 Jobs</h2>
  <p class="date">14.07.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_99" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to an analysis by experts from the Moore Czech Republic consulting group, the termination of two parts of the Antivirus program at the end of May had almost no impact on the unemployment statistics. At the beginning of the year, the consulting firm's data indicated that the program artificially maintained approximately 100,000 workers. A significant portion of the Antivirus program, which compensated for closed businesses and offset production, service, and demand restrictions, ended in late May. However, pessimistic scenarios of layoffs and increased unemployment following the end of government support did not materialize. "The Antivirus program, at the cost of a significant increase in public debt, achieved its purpose – maintaining low unemployment. Although some companies experienced layoffs after its termination, businesses did not resort to this step on a large scale, and it did not affect overall unemployment," commented Radovan Hauk, partner at Moore Czech Republic. Instead of increased unemployment, the Czech economy faces a shortage of labor. Sectors such as industry and IT have long lacked qualified workers. The hospitality sector is also struggling with a shortage, as workers are hesitant to return due to an uncertain future. Companies across segments are unsuccessfully searching for workers, even though the labor office registers over 273,000 job seekers.

**Summary:**

A recent analysis by Moore Czech Republic reveals that the end of the Antivirus program, which had artificially supported around 100,000 jobs, didn't lead to the predicted surge in unemployment. While some layoffs occurred, the overall impact was minimal. The Antivirus program successfully kept unemployment low during the crisis, although it significantly increased public debt. Radovan Hauk of Moore Czech Republic highlights that companies benefiting from Antivirus have since recovered, securing enough work for their employees, while many previously laid-off workers have found new jobs. Instead of rising unemployment, the Czech Republic is now grappling with a labor shortage, particularly in sectors like industry, IT, and hospitality. Despite a high number of registered job seekers, companies struggle to find suitable candidates, attributed to a reluctance to switch industries. The Czech Republic is attempting to address this through modularized retraining programs.

  <h2>Czech Republic's debt did not increase significantly more in 2020 than in other Visegrad Four countries</h2>
  <p class="date">01.07.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_100" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Across the European Union, the Czech Republic has the 4th smallest public debt as a proportion of GDP. Estonia recorded the largest relative change in public debt in 2020, doubling its debt (an increase of 108.8%). In 2020, debt increased in all four Visegrad countries. The Czech Republic had the lowest overall debt within the V4 in terms of public debt to GDP ratio (38.1%), although the year-on-year change in public debt was the second largest within the V4, as was the absolute change in public debt per capita, which amounted to EUR 1,269 (CZK 32,300). "In the Czech Republic, the relative change in debt in 2020 reached 19.8%, which is more than the average of the 27 EU states," says Radovan Hauk, partner at Moore Czech Republic. "On the other hand, the absolute change in public debt per capita was then less than half the EU average, which was EUR 2,772." Similar to other EU countries, the increase in debt in the V4 countries was mainly due to coronavirus restrictions and compensation expenditure by individual governments. "With the help of compensation expenditure, it was possible to maintain employment in the Czech Republic, so the reduction in household consumption was not so significant. This year, the state's debt ratio is expected to increase to 44.3% of GDP. In the case of the other Visegrad Four countries, a slight decrease in the public debt to GDP ratio is expected for this year, mainly due to the lower rate of growth of their debt than the rate of GDP growth," adds Radovan Hauk.

**Summary:**

In 2020, the Czech Republic experienced a notable increase in public debt due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government compensation spending, although it still maintains one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU. While the Czech Republic's relative debt increase exceeded the EU average, its absolute debt increase per capita was significantly lower. The Visegrad Four countries collectively saw increased debt, with Estonia experiencing the most dramatic surge across the EU. The Czech Republic had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio within the V4 but recorded the second-highest year-over-year increase and per capita debt change within the group. Government support measures in the Czech Republic helped stabilize employment and consumption. For 2021, the Czech Republic anticipates a further rise in its debt-to-GDP ratio, while other Visegrad countries expect a slight decline due to faster GDP growth compared to debt accumulation. The EU as a whole saw a substantial increase in public debt in 2020, reflecting the economic impact of the pandemic.

  <h2>Comparison of Fiscal Measures in the Visegrad Four Countries: The Czech Republic Spent the Second Most Per Capita in the Fight Against Covid-19</h2>
  <p class="date">17.06.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_101" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to a comparative analysis by Moore Czech Republic, based on International Monetary Fund (IMF) data, a significant portion of the aid provided to Visegrad Four (V4) countries during the pandemic flowed into the economy as liquidity support in the form of guarantees, while the Czech Republic released only 5.4% of its GDP in above-the-line measures. Only Slovakia spent less, at 4.4% of GDP.

Per capita, the Czech Republic spent more than Poland (25,577 CZK) and Slovakia (20,062 CZK). The United States spent the most globally, at approximately 413,000 CZK per capita, while Austria led the European Union with 144,000 CZK per capita.

Radovan Hauk, a partner at Moore Czech Republic, noted that fiscal measures took two forms: above-the-line measures and liquidity support. The Czech Republic was more active in using guarantees, injecting 15.4% of GDP into the economy that way, compared to 4% in Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia. Direct economic support in all V4 countries mainly compensated wages for employees and the self-employed in affected sectors, provided sick leave and care allowances, supported rent payments for businesses, compensated lost income, and offered tax deferrals or exemptions.

Most above-the-line funding in all V4 countries went to non-healthcare sectors. Poland provided the highest support at 7.4% of GDP, followed by Hungary at 6.4%. The Czech Republic and Slovakia spent the least in non-healthcare sectors at 4.2% of GDP. These expenses included employment support, parental care allowances, self-employed care allowances, business rent support, and programs supporting sports, culture, tourism, transport, restaurants, agriculture, and other closed sectors. Healthcare support primarily involved purchasing medical supplies, bonuses for social workers, hospital staff, public health workers, and paramedics, patient care support, co-financing healthcare infrastructure development, telemedicine, digitalization, and other healthcare measures. Hungary provided the most healthcare support at 9,017 CZK per capita (2.8% of GDP). The Czech Republic allocated 1.2% of GDP, or 5,628 CZK per capita, to healthcare.

Public money injections contributed to growth ranging from 3.4% (Czech Republic) to 5.0% (Hungary). Slovakia and Poland are expected to return to their pre-pandemic economic performance the fastest, possibly this year. The Czech Republic, which experienced a 4.6% year-on-year GDP decline in 2020, is projected to recover to its pre-COVID performance in 2022.

**Summary:**

A comparative analysis of fiscal measures taken by the Visegrad Four (V4) countries during the pandemic reveals that the Czech Republic relied heavily on liquidity support through guarantees (15.4% of GDP), spending less on direct measures (5.4% of GDP) compared to its neighbors. Only Slovakia spent less on direct measures. Per capita spending in the Czech Republic exceeded that of Poland and Slovakia, but trailed behind global leaders like the United States and Austria.

Most direct financial assistance across the V4 nations focused on compensating wages, providing sick leave, supporting businesses with rent, and offering tax relief. Non-healthcare sectors received the bulk of the funding, with Poland and Hungary providing the most support. The Czech Republic and Slovakia spent the least in these areas. Healthcare funding supported medical supplies, staff bonuses, infrastructure development, and telemedicine. Hungary dedicated the most per capita to healthcare.

While the fiscal stimulus boosted economic growth across the V4, the Czech Republic's growth was among the lowest. Slovakia and Poland are anticipated to regain their pre-pandemic economic levels fastest, potentially this year, whereas the Czech Republic’s recovery is projected for 2022, following a significant GDP decline in 2020.

  <h2>More legal entities and self-employed persons will now receive a data mailbox</h2>
  <p class="date">10.06.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_102" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

A significant new development is the expansion of the range of people who will have a data mailbox created automatically, without their request. According to experts at Moore Legal CZ, the automatic creation of data mailboxes for the above-mentioned persons will have a significant impact not only on the way documents are delivered to these persons by authorities (or other persons), but it may also create an obligation for them to submit filings to the authorities through the data mailbox. According to the approved amendment in the wording of the Senate's amendments, effective January 1, 2023, a data mailbox will be automatically created for: Every legal entity that is registered in the register of persons, i.e. not only legal entities registered in the commercial register, as has been the case until now, but also legal entities that are registered in the association register, foundation register, institute register, association of unit owners or non-profit companies. Every self-employed natural person, lawyer, statutory auditor, tax advisor, insolvency administrator, expert, court interpreter and court translator. Currently, data mailboxes were only established for self-employed natural persons (sole traders) upon their request, but now the Ministry of the Interior will automatically create a data mailbox for these persons. Every legally competent natural person registered in the basic population register who uses a means for electronic identification issued within the framework of a qualified electronic identification system. That is, also non-entrepreneurial natural persons, if they actively use a means of qualified electronic identification (currently, this is mainly an identity card with an activated electronic chip, the ID Portal of the national point for identification and authentication (NIA ID), a chip card for creating a qualified electronic signature or bank identity). In the latter case, the person may, at his request, make the data mailbox inaccessible (i.e. "deactivate" it) through the Ministry of the Interior. "Thorough public awareness will be important so that documents, such as decisions of administrative bodies, are not delivered without the new data mailbox owners knowing about it, thereby missing the relevant deadlines," comments Jan Kubica, lawyer and partner at Moore Legal CZ from the Moore Czech Republic group, on the expected impact of the amendment. Unification of the moment of delivery of documents Another significant legislative change is the unification of the moment of delivery of private law documents with the moment of delivery of public law documents. The moment of delivery for both types of documents will be the moment when a person who has the right to access the delivered document logs into the data mailbox. If a person does not regularly log in to their data mailbox, there is also a fiction of delivery, where the document is considered delivered within 10 days from the date of delivery of the document to the data mailbox. "The aim of this amendment is to prevent obstructions in the delivery of documents without having to distinguish whether it is the delivery of a private law document or a document containing a public law act. This can be assessed as a step in the right direction," concludes Jan Kubica of Moore Legal CZ.

**Summary:**

As of January 1, 2023, the Czech Republic will automatically create data mailboxes for a wider range of individuals and legal entities, including all legal entities in the register of persons (extending beyond just those in the commercial register), self-employed individuals, lawyers, auditors, tax advisors, and any citizen using qualified electronic identification. Individuals can request deactivation through the Ministry of the Interior. This expands mandatory electronic communication with authorities, potentially obligating users to submit official filings electronically. Moore Legal CZ emphasizes the need for public awareness to avoid missed deadlines due to unawareness of delivered documents.

Furthermore, the legislation unifies the delivery rules for private and public law documents. Delivery is considered complete upon login to the data mailbox or, failing that, after 10 days of the document's arrival in the mailbox. This change aims to streamline the delivery process and prevent obstruction, regardless of the document's nature. The reform is viewed as a positive step toward efficient administrative processes.

  <h2>New Law on the Register of Beneficial Owners of Companies and Entrepreneurs to Enter into Force in June, Sanctions May Be Imposed</h2>
  <p class="date">30.04.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_106" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Moore Legal CZ warns entrepreneurs to pay close attention to the new law regarding the register of beneficial owners, as it introduces several penalties for non-compliance. Legal entities and trusts are obligated to record information about their beneficial owners. A significant change is that only a natural person can be a beneficial owner of a business corporation. If the beneficial owner is not clearly identifiable, senior management, such as members of the statutory body, will be recorded. The law also introduces an "automatic entry" for companies with simple ownership structures.

The new law defines a beneficial owner as any natural person who is the ultimate beneficiary or person with ultimate control. An ultimate beneficiary is someone who can directly or indirectly receive a substantial portion of the total economic benefit, while a person with ultimate control can directly or indirectly exert decisive influence in a legal entity. For business corporations, a beneficial owner is a natural person who has the right to a share of profits, other equity, or liquidation balance exceeding 25%, or who holds a direct or indirect share of voting rights that significantly exceeds the voting rights of others, especially if it exceeds 25%.

Failure to register beneficial owner information can result in fines of up to CZK 500,000 for individuals, a ban on profit distribution, or a ban on voting in the decision-making of the highest body of the business corporation. Entrepreneurs should not underestimate the law's impact, as the penalties are substantial. The law, effective from June 1st, requires companies to begin addressing this issue promptly. Furthermore, some information from the register of beneficial owners will be made publicly available on the Ministry of Justice website.

**Summary:**

A new Czech law concerning the register of beneficial owners, effective June 1st, introduces significant changes and penalties for non-compliance. Legal entities and trusts must register their beneficial owners, who must be natural persons, even in complex ownership structures. If a beneficial owner isn't clearly identifiable, senior management will be registered. The law defines beneficial owners as individuals ultimately benefiting from or controlling the entity. For corporations, this includes individuals entitled to over 25% of profits or controlling a significant portion of voting rights. Failure to register can result in substantial fines, bans on profit distribution, or restrictions on voting rights. Moore Legal CZ advises entrepreneurs to address this issue immediately due to the serious penalties. Selected data from the beneficial owners register will become publicly accessible via the Justice Ministry's web pages.

  <h2>Most Czechs would welcome a four-day work week. Companies also see benefits in it, but are not yet considering its implementation.</h2>
  <p class="date">12.03.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_108" class="summary">
    A recent survey conducted by Ipsos for Moore Czech Republic reveals that 60% of Czechs would welcome a four-day work week, even if it meant working more intensely to compensate for the reduced hours. The proposed change, currently under consideration in the Czech parliament, aims to shorten the work week from 40 to 35 hours across four days. However, over 20% of respondents prefer spreading their work over five days for a more relaxed pace, finding the four-day schedule potentially stressful.

A separate survey focused on managers in small and medium-sized businesses showed that nearly two-thirds believe a shorter work week could boost employee productivity and satisfaction. Conversely, over a fifth of managers fear it could harm companies by reducing output and overall performance. Despite the potential benefits, only 13% are considering implementing a four-day week in the next five years, while a quarter reject the idea entirely, and half remain uncertain.

Regarding feasibility, about 20% of managers believe their companies could fulfill weekly tasks in four days without increasing daily productivity, while a third think it's possible only with increased output. Another 20% believe all five days are necessary. Around 16% already find five days insufficient. The prevailing European model involves a 40-hour week, with some countries like Liechtenstein and Switzerland extending to 50 hours. France, Denmark, and Belgium have the shortest at 38 hours. Experts note the four-day week isn't universally applicable, particularly in customer-facing roles. The survey included 330 respondents from the general public and 330 managers.

  <h2>Transaction Activity in Sectors Hardest Hit by Pandemic Rises by Tens of Percent, Generational Change Will Also Accelerate Company Sales</h2>
  <p class="date">07.03.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_110" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Larger players with sufficient capital will be able to take advantage of the current unfavorable position of entrepreneurs in these sectors and their possible insolvencies. On the other hand, companies engaged in technology development or industrial automation will be in a stronger position towards investors. Generational change in family businesses, which began in our region approximately five years ago, may also increase the number of transactions. According to the consulting company Moore Czech Republic, the pandemic favors large players in the market in terms of transactional activities. This is especially true in gastronomy and tourism, i.e., in areas that have been most affected by anti-epidemic measures. "Investors with sufficient capital will be able to acquire these assets at lower prices, consolidate them, and build larger units. We, therefore, expect transaction activity in these sectors to increase by a low double-digit percentage this year compared to last year," says Petr Kymlička, partner at Moore Czech Republic. The price of technology companies will increase. The past period, on the other hand, strengthened companies involved in industrial automation, the development of technologies for complex remote work, or virtual and augmented reality. This allows, for example, the introduction of highly efficient remote repair and maintenance processes. "It can be expected that companies from these fields will be in demand on the market and demand for them will increase. They will, therefore, be traded at higher prices than in the previous period. These companies are aware of the lack of human resources, which they are replacing with their technologies. The aforementioned effect of the pandemic was particularly amplified in industrial enterprises, where a large proportion of foreign workers became unavailable," explains Petr Kymlička. In the coming years, according to Moore Czech Republic, there will also be an intensification of generational change in the ownership of family businesses. This process began to appear more significantly among Czech companies in the last five years, and it should gain momentum this year and next year. "The current situation will strengthen the motivation of the current generation of owners to hand over businesses to the younger generation. On the other hand, the latter will show greater reluctance and fear of taking over companies on their own responsibility," adds Václav Škapa, partner at the company and expert in transaction consulting. For these reasons, according to him, the role of foreign strategic investors, whose goal is to strengthen their position in the region, could strengthen on the Czech market. The second half of the year will be marked by growth. According to Moore Czech Republic, the growth of transactional activities will only be reflected in the second half of the year. This is because there will also be a "restart" of transactions that were postponed or interrupted last year. "Despite significant restrictions in 2020, we managed to complete twenty medium-sized transactions across various segments of the economy, especially in industry and technology. The number of active mandates increased by fifteen percent year-on-year," says Václav Škapa. A factor that could, on the other hand, slow down mergers and acquisitions is the difference in price expectations. "While sellers will tend to base their expectations on performance in times of growth, buyers will take into account risk factors in valuations that they did not consider a year ago. Overall, however, we see 2021 as very promising from the perspective of transaction consulting," adds Petr Kymlička.

**Summary:**

Moore Czech Republic predicts a rise in transactional activity in the Czech Republic, particularly in the second half of 2021. The pandemic has created opportunities for larger players with capital to acquire assets in struggling sectors like gastronomy and tourism at lower prices. Simultaneously, companies specializing in industrial automation, remote work technologies, and virtual/augmented reality are experiencing increased demand and higher valuations. Generational shifts within family-owned businesses are also expected to accelerate, potentially leading to more acquisitions, including those by foreign strategic investors seeking to solidify their regional presence. While differences in price expectations between buyers and sellers may pose a challenge, the overall outlook for mergers and acquisitions in 2021 is positive. Many transactions delayed in 2020 are anticipated to resume, contributing to the projected growth.

**Refined Summary:**

The Czech Republic's transactional landscape is poised for growth in the latter half of 2021, according to Moore Czech Republic. The pandemic's economic fallout has created opportunities for well-capitalized firms to acquire distressed assets in sectors like hospitality at reduced prices. Conversely, companies focused on industrial automation, remote work solutions, and virtual reality are experiencing increased demand and higher valuations due to the accelerated adoption of these technologies. An anticipated surge in generational transitions within family-owned businesses is also expected to fuel M&A activity, potentially attracting foreign strategic investors eager to strengthen their regional foothold. Despite potential hurdles arising from diverging price expectations between buyers and sellers, the overall outlook for M&A activity in the Czech Republic remains optimistic, supported by the resumption of transactions deferred from 2020.

  <h2>Asian economies outpace Europe in economic growth, helped by rapid recovery from the pandemic</h2>
  <p class="date">19.02.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_111" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

The main reason is the significant, and above all faster, improvement in the epidemic situation there, which allowed an earlier return to economic growth. For example, Chinese economic growth in the last quarter of 2020 returned to pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, the EU economy fell by 6.4% last year, while the Czech economy fell by 5.6% according to the Czech Statistical Office. The Chinese government published economic data for the entire last year in mid-January. The world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP showed stable growth even before the coronavirus pandemic, recording its first GDP decline since 1978 only in the first quarter of 2020. However, it already showed recovery in the second and third quarters and year-on-year GDP growth, which reached 6.5% in the last quarter of last year. "Chinese GDP for the entire last year grew by 2.3%, resulting in a historic exceeding of the 100 trillion yuan mark, or almost fifteen trillion dollars," says Karel Kučera, Director of Asia Desk and partner at the consulting company Moore Czech Republic. In contrast, the economy of the European Union fell last year, according to Eurostat data, by a total of 6.4%, and in the euro area even by 6.8%. Spain, Italy, and France faced the largest year-on-year GDP declines in 2020. However, the Czech Republic performed better than the European Union as a whole, its economy falling by 5.6% according to the Czech Statistical Office. In the fourth quarter, it even improved very slightly (by 0.3%). Neighboring Slovakia, for example, showed slightly worse results, with GDP falling by 6%. Asian economies are not hampered by tough restrictions. Contrary to all expectations, Asian economies are now growing even faster. China's stable supply environment also allows its surrounding countries to profit. "In addition to the Chinese economy, which recovered quickly after tough measures, this trend will also be followed in Japan and South Korea. In these countries, economies function without similar restrictions as currently found across Europe. As a result, Chinese, Japanese, and South Korean companies are gaining a significant economic advantage on a global scale," explains Karel Kučera. Although Japanese GDP fell in the first two quarters of last year, it grew by 5.3% in the third quarter and 3% in the fourth. It almost reached the level before the coronavirus pandemic, but the Japanese economy recorded a loss due to the first half of the year. South Korea also experienced a GDP decline in the first half of the year, but in the third quarter, it grew by 2.1% and in the fourth by 1.1%. Again, it almost reached pre-coronavirus values. Last year's results also indicate an expansion of imports and exports in the Chinese market. The total aggregate value of imports and exports increased by 1.6% year-on-year. In Asian countries, on the other hand, the tourism sector is losing strength. "In addition to short-term outages, these economies will be mainly affected by the decline caused by the restriction of tourism, as well as the related shifts in investments over time, especially international ones," adds Karel Kučera from Moore Czech Republic. China has started up. Results from the end of last year indicate growth of the Chinese economy in the future. For example, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) grew, reaching a value of 53 in December. However, the European Union performed better in this, where the PMI reached 55.2 points. Retail sales in China increased by 4.6% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, and even by 10.9% in online trading. Despite these increases, however, total retail sales of consumer goods for 2020 decreased by 4%. In China, however, there was greater stabilization of the unemployment rate. Almost twelve million people found employment in China last year, while the goal of local authorities was to achieve at least nine million newly employed. While the unemployment rate in Chinese urban areas in December last year reached 5.6%, it was 7.5% in the European Union.

**Summary:**

China's economy rebounded swiftly from the pandemic, achieving pre-pandemic growth levels by the end of 2020, driven by a faster improvement in the epidemic situation and fewer restrictions. Its GDP grew by 2.3% for the year, surpassing 100 trillion yuan. This contrasts with the European Union, where economies shrank by 6.4% overall, with larger declines in Spain, Italy and France. While the Czech Republic experienced a 5.6% decrease, it fared better than the EU average. Asian economies, particularly China, Japan, and South Korea, benefit from a stable supply environment and fewer restrictions, providing them with a global economic advantage. While Japan and South Korea experienced initial GDP declines, both showed signs of recovery in the latter half of the year. The Chinese market also saw growth in imports and exports. However, Asian economies face challenges due to the decline in tourism. Indicators like the Purchasing Managers' Index suggest continued growth for China. The unemployment rate in Chinese urban areas also remains lower than in the EU.

**Refined:**

China's economy has demonstrated a remarkable recovery from the pandemic, surpassing pre-pandemic growth levels by the end of 2020. This rapid rebound, fueled by effective epidemic control and less stringent restrictions, propelled China's GDP to a 2.3% increase for the year, exceeding 100 trillion yuan. In contrast, the European Union experienced a 6.4% economic contraction, with Spain, Italy, and France suffering the most significant declines. The Czech Republic’s 5.6% decrease was less severe than the EU average. Supported by a stable supply chain and fewer operational limitations, Asian economies, including China, Japan, and South Korea, are positioned for continued growth. While Japan and South Korea experienced initial setbacks, they exhibited strong signs of recovery in the latter half of the year. China's trade sector is also expanding. However, the decline in tourism poses a challenge for these economies. Positive indicators, such as a rising Purchasing Managers' Index, suggest continued economic expansion in China, which also boasts a lower urban unemployment rate compared to the EU.

  <h2>COVID compensation for training companies does not reflect actual losses, the threatened demise of hundreds of them will slow down the restart of the economy</h2>
  <p class="date">09.02.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_112" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Hundreds of training facilities in the Czech Republic are facing potential closure due to inadequate government compensation for losses incurred during mandatory shutdowns. The compensation, based on the number of employees and closure period, fails to address the actual fixed costs, such as rent or property expenses, incurred by these facilities. Moore Czech Republic estimates that the compensations only cover 40-50% of the financial losses these companies suffered last year.

The main problem is that compensations only consider months with mandatory closures. Training centers lost most of their revenue during the peak seasons of spring and autumn due to government restrictions. While they were allowed to operate in the summer months (June-September), demand was lower due to holidays and lingering COVID-19 concerns, causing many to postpone courses to autumn. This shift increased expenses as autumn operations were eventually restricted and subsequently banned. The current compensation program also factors in the number of employees, which is not always proportionate to the actual fixed costs of running a training facility.

Moore Czech Republic suggests that compensation should be tied to demonstrable revenue decline or coverage of fixed costs, as in other countries, rather than solely based on formal closures. They warn that the potential closure of these facilities could hinder the economic recovery due to a lack of retraining resources needed to address rising unemployment.

**Summary:**

Hundreds of Czech training facilities are at risk of collapse due to insufficient government compensation for COVID-19 related losses. Compensation is based on mandatory closure periods and number of employees which does not reflect actual costs. These businesses experienced significant revenue losses during their peak spring and autumn seasons due to government restrictions. While operations were permitted during summer months, low demand, exacerbated by COVID-19 concerns, resulted in shifted schedules and increased operational costs when subsequent restrictions were imposed.

Consulting firm Moore Czech Republic criticizes the compensation model, advocating for support tied to demonstrable revenue losses or fixed cost coverage, in line with practices in other countries. They estimate current support only covers 40-50% of last year's losses. The closure of these facilities will negatively impact the economic recovery, as these firms are crucial in providing retraining resources to address rising unemployment. Insufficient capacity could slow down the Czech Republic’s economic restart.

  <h2>Advisory Group Moore Czech Republic Created a Comprehensive Holding Structure, Wants to Compete with the "Big Four" with Comprehensive Services</h2>
  <p class="date">28.01.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_113" class="summary">
    Moore Czech Republic aims to become a top-five player in the Czech market and rival the "Big Four" consulting firms by offering a comprehensive range of services. The group plans to achieve a turnover of one billion Czech crowns within five years.

Their structure includes subsidiaries specializing in management consulting and M&A (Moore Advisory CZ), auditing (Moore Audit CZ), accounting and tax outsourcing (Moore Accounting CZ), IT (Moore Technology CZ), education (Moore Academy CZ), and legal services (Moore Legal CZ). The company aims to provide both comprehensive and specialized services, including expert appraisals later this year.

Moore Czech Republic emphasizes a unique combination of expertise, international experience, and practical solutions, focusing on taking responsibility for business unit management and achieving clear results, particularly in technology.

In the past fiscal year, Moore Czech Republic achieved a consolidated turnover of approximately half a billion crowns. They aim to double this within five years through organic growth and acquisitions. While a conservative growth of 10% is expected this year for full integration of new acquisitions, eight companies were integrated last year to broaden services, including those in auditing, tax, accounting, legal, and technology like Servodata, Mycroft Mind and Care Plus Service. The company welcomes new partners including Marcela Hrdá, Miloslav Rut, Václav Škapa, Karel Kučera and the original partners of acquired companies to strengthen it's different sectors.

Moore Czech Republic has been part of Moore Global since 2020. Moore Global is supporting their expansion to offer global know-how and local expertise.

  <h2>Due to the discussed amendment to the law, data mailboxes could be mandatory for other legal entities and self-employed persons in addition to companies.</h2>
  <p class="date">26.01.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_114" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

A proposed amendment to the law is being discussed in the Chamber of Deputies that could bring fundamental changes to the establishment of data mailboxes. According to Moore Legal CZ, if adopted, the amendment would significantly expand the range of legal entities and individuals for whom a data mailbox would be automatically established by law. In certain cases, data mailboxes could even be established for non-entrepreneurial individuals (citizens). Electronic communication, influenced by the current pandemic, is becoming a key tool both in private contact and in communication with public administration and more broadly within eGovernment.

"If the amendment were adopted in its current form, it would substantially expand the possibilities of establishing data mailboxes for individuals and legal entities. Until now, data mailboxes have been automatically established by law mainly for legal entities registered in the commercial register, simply put, companies. The adoption of the amendment would extend this range to other legal entities 'registered in the register of persons', such as foundations or associations, and also self-employed individuals, which are typically tradespeople," explains Jan Kubica, an attorney and partner at Moore Legal CZ, part of the Moore Czech Republic group.

Depending on the further development of the legislative proposal, changes may also occur in the establishment of data mailboxes by law for non-entrepreneurial individuals, i.e., ordinary citizens. A data mailbox would be automatically and immediately established for them after such a person first uses a so-called qualified means of electronic identification. In the Czech Republic, these means currently include primarily an identity card with an electronic chip, the NIA ID portal using a name, password, and SMS code, and a chip card for creating a qualified electronic signature.

"While simplifying the possibility of establishing a data mailbox is certainly a step in the right direction, expanding data mailboxes without further consideration is questionable. At present, however, it is not yet clear in what form, or even whether, the amendment will be adopted," adds attorney Jan Kubica. According to current legislation, legal entities registered in the commercial register are required to have a data mailbox, which is automatically established upon registration of the entity in the commercial register. Other legal entities, such as associations, foundations, or homeowner associations, are not required to have a data mailbox. If they wish to use one, it is established at their own request.

According to the current wording of the proposal, the amendment should also unify the moment of delivery of private law documents with the moment of delivery of public law documents. This will be the same moment when a person authorized to access the delivered document logs into the data mailbox. If such a person does not log into the data mailbox within 10 days of the date of delivery of the document to the data mailbox, the document is considered delivered on the last day of the deadline.

"The purpose of this amendment is to prevent obstructions in the delivery of private law documents without having to distinguish whether it is the delivery of a private law document or a document containing a public law act. This can be assessed as a reasonable step in the right direction," adds Jan Kubica from Moore Legal CZ. The amendment would also help to increase the security of electronic communication, as well as the overall development of eGovernment in general. In public administration, digitization has long been progressing at a slower pace than in the private sector. The current era marked by the pandemic and extraordinary measures is increasingly favoring greater electronization and automation.

**Summary:**

A proposed amendment to Czech law aims to broaden the scope of individuals and entities required to have data mailboxes, a secure form of electronic communication with public authorities. Currently, data mailboxes are mandatory for companies registered in the commercial register. The amendment would extend this requirement to other registered legal entities like foundations and self-employed individuals. Potentially, it could even lead to automatic data mailbox creation for citizens upon their first use of qualified electronic identification methods such as ID cards with electronic chips or the NIA ID portal. This initiative seeks to streamline communication and promote eGovernment, particularly as electronic interactions have become increasingly vital during the pandemic. The proposal also aims to standardize the delivery of private and public legal documents, establishing a 10-day period for acknowledging receipt before automatic confirmation. While seen as a step towards greater efficiency and security in electronic communication, some experts suggest that expanding data mailboxes without careful consideration could be problematic. The final form and eventual adoption of the amendment remain uncertain.

  <h2>Car Production Will Stagnate at Best in 2021</h2>
  <p class="date">21.01.2021</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_115" class="summary">
    Translation:

The year 2020 was significantly complicated for the automotive industry. Car production was strongly affected by the global pandemic. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) reports a decrease of 23.7% in the European Union last year, a drop to 9.94 million vehicles. The year-on-year decline in the Czech Republic also approached 20%. Although the number of newly sold cars increased by 8.7% year-on-year in December, sales fell sharply again in January 2021, by 18.8%. The decline from the autumn of last year therefore continues. Vaccination, combined with a spring improvement in the epidemic situation, may bring improvement, but this may not realistically materialize until the middle of the year. "Ultimately, in 2021, we can expect stagnation in the volume of motor vehicle production in the Czech Republic in the best case, and a decrease of another five to seven percent in more pessimistic scenarios," says Petr Kymlička, partner at the consulting company Moore Czech Republic. Despite all government support programs, this could mean layoffs. Automation, the introduction of which was significantly accelerated by the pandemic, also has an impact. Increased demand for retraining and the movement of employees to other sectors is therefore expected. Manufacturers put pressure on subcontractors The decline in demand for new cars is reflected throughout the automotive industry, which consists of a wide network of subcontractors. Their reliability is becoming a critical factor for car manufacturers, but subcontractors face a number of problems as a result of the pandemic. "As is common in times of crisis, individual manufacturers, on the other hand, are trying to pass on a large part of their problems to subcontractors. Call-offs are being dramatically reduced, and pressure is increasing on the price and payment terms of subcontractors," explains Petr Kymlička. Necessary investments in electromobility complicate the situation The crisis caused by the global pandemic comes for the automotive industry at a time when pressure is significantly intensifying for large-scale investments in production as a result of demands for greening. "The decrease in demand, together with the growth of necessary investments in electromobility and in automation reducing dependence on the workforce, will complicate the situation of the automotive industry in the Czech Republic in the years to come," adds Petr Kymlička from Moore Czech Republic.

Summary and Refinement:

The automotive industry faced significant challenges in 2020 due to the global pandemic, with car production in the EU experiencing a 23.7% drop. The Czech Republic also saw a nearly 20% year-on-year decrease. Despite a brief surge in sales in December, January 2021 witnessed a sharp 18.8% decline, continuing the downward trend. Petr Kymlička of Moore Czech Republic forecasts potential stagnation or a further 5-7% decrease in Czech motor vehicle production for 2021.

Government support programs may not prevent layoffs, exacerbated by pandemic-driven automation. This could lead to increased demand for retraining and workforce shifts. The reduced demand for new vehicles is impacting the extensive network of automotive subcontractors, who are facing reliability issues and increased pressure from manufacturers regarding pricing and payment terms.

Adding to these difficulties, the automotive industry is under pressure to invest heavily in electromobility to meet environmental regulations. This combination of reduced demand and necessary investments in green technologies and automation is expected to complicate the automotive industry's situation in the Czech Republic for years to come. The pandemic's impact is far-reaching, creating a complex landscape for manufacturers and suppliers alike.

  <h2>Only about a tenth of Prague's sports facilities are accessible, a new sports development plan should help improve the situation</h2>
  <p class="date">10.12.2020</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_116" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

According to a survey conducted by the Prague City Hall among sports facility operators, nearly a third (30.5%) of Prague's sports venues should be barrier-free. However, an analysis of the passport of these facilities showed that their actual proportion is only less than a tenth (9.6%). The number of sports venues truly suitable for sports activities of disabled people is probably even much lower, with many cases only accounting for their passive role. A new sports development plan should help to make sports facilities accessible. The analysis also highlights a number of obstacles faced by disabled athletes, such as unsuitable pitch sizes, unsuitable surfaces, lack of barrier-free toilets, or unsuitable location or size of changing rooms. The capital city, which owns a total of 104 Prague sports venues, is therefore preparing a new plan for the development of sport and sports facilities in Prague. One of its aims is to make existing and new sports venues more accessible to disabled people. "The city's goal is to increase the accessibility of sports facilities, especially through the construction of new and truly barrier-free sports venues. We should achieve this through greater involvement of organizations representing disabled athletes in the evaluation of barrier-free solutions," says Vít Šimral, Prague City Councillor for Sport. Creating suitable conditions for regular physical activity can achieve positive effects in the area of physical, mental and social health in people with disabilities. It also leads to functional independence in everyday activities and a general improvement in quality of life. Physical activity also serves as a prevention against chronic diseases, but also against negative mental states. "The accessibility of a sports facility for people with disabilities does not itself mean that it is also suitable for the performance of their sports activities. For example, the absence of barrier-free sanitary facilities completely prevents people with disabilities from participating in organized sports activities in a dignified manner," says Tomáš Buriánek, a sports expert at the consulting company Moore Czech Republic, which conducted the analysis. Involvement of organizations and clubs for disabled people. As part of the preparation of the new sports development strategy, a questionnaire survey was carried out, through which Prague residents, and especially those who play sports, could express their needs and preferences in their locality. More than twenty meetings of working groups focusing on various sports topics were also held. A wide range of stakeholders, including organizations and clubs representing disabled athletes, were involved in these to help address the problems of limited access to Prague's sports facilities. "A necessary note is the fact that this is not just a problem of Prague, but it is a systemic problem at the level of the whole Czech Republic. Unfortunately, the decree, which takes into account all disabilities, is not strictly followed," adds Alena Jančíková, director of the Czech Paraplegic Association, who was also a member of the working group.

**Summary:**

A Prague City Hall survey revealed a discrepancy between the perceived and actual accessibility of sports venues for disabled individuals. While 30.5% of operators believed their facilities were barrier-free, an analysis showed only 9.6% truly met accessibility standards. Many venues lack crucial features like appropriate field sizes, surfaces, accessible restrooms, and suitable changing rooms, hindering disabled athletes' full participation. To address this, Prague is developing a new sports development plan aimed at enhancing accessibility through new constructions and modifications of existing facilities. The plan emphasizes involving organizations representing disabled athletes in the evaluation of barrier-free designs. Experts highlight that mere accessibility is insufficient; the absence of supportive amenities prevents dignified participation. The initiative includes surveys and working groups involving various stakeholders to identify and address specific accessibility challenges. The Czech Paraplegic Association emphasizes that this issue extends beyond Prague, reflecting a nationwide systemic problem due to inconsistent enforcement of disability-inclusive regulations. The goal is to promote physical activity among disabled individuals, improving their physical, mental, and social health, ultimately boosting their overall quality of life.

**Refined Summary:**

A survey by Prague City Hall exposed a significant gap between perceived and actual accessibility in the city's sports venues for people with disabilities. While operators estimated that nearly a third of facilities were barrier-free, an audit found only 9.6% truly compliant. Key accessibility shortcomings include inappropriate field dimensions, unsuitable surfaces, lack of adapted restrooms, and inaccessible changing areas, restricting participation. Prague is now developing a new sports strategy to address this, prioritizing the construction of genuinely barrier-free facilities and modifications to existing venues. This strategy emphasizes including disability advocacy groups in the assessment of accessibility designs. Experts caution that basic accessibility alone is insufficient, as the absence of appropriate amenities hinders dignified participation. The development involves public surveys and stakeholder working groups to identify and solve specific issues. The Czech Paraplegic Association points out that this is a national problem, due to uneven enforcement of accessibility regulations. The goal is to improve accessibility, to enable physical activity among people with disabilities, improving their overall health and well-being.

  <h2>Moore Czech Republic Group strengthens audit services, also focuses on special IT audit</h2>
  <p class="date">03.11.2020</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_117" class="summary">
    Moore Czech Republic has expanded its services to include comprehensive IT audits, evaluating companies' ICT technologies from both technical and security perspectives, and suggesting optimizations.

  <h2>New petition aims to classify esports on par with traditional sports, inspired by Germany</h2>
  <p class="date">21.10.2020</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_118" class="summary">
    The Czech Electronic Sport Association (CESA), representing esports players, teams, and organizations, has launched a petition to the Czech government and the National Sports Agency, advocating for the official recognition of esports as a legitimate leisure activity beneficial for both mental and physical well-being. The petition seeks to grant esports clubs and organizations the same eligibility for state support as traditional sports, drawing inspiration from Germany, where esports clubs have achieved non-profit status, clarifying tax and donation regulations and opening avenues for financial support.

The petition highlights the discipline, strategic thinking, and other skills required of esports players and urges the government to implement measures that equalize esports with other sports activities. The petition has garnered support from hundreds of members of the gaming community, as well as large multinational corporations, attracted by the growing popularity of esports, which engages approximately three million people directly and indirectly in the Czech Republic.

  <h2>Czech Esport Community Will Have Half a Million People in Five Years, in Germany It Is Already a Fully-Fledged Sport</h2>
  <p class="date">10.08.2020</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_122" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Electronic sport, or esports, is becoming a significant part of the sports world globally, attracting not only players with professional ambitions, but also viewers and sponsors. For example, last year's World Championship in the popular game League of Legends was watched in its peak moment by more viewers (4 million) than the stream of the NFL American football league final (3.4 million). "In the Czech Republic, esports directly and indirectly affects approximately three million people. The core esports environment comprises around 350,000 people, consisting of players participating in tournaments or their active fans. This is more than the number of people registered by the Czech Republic's most popular sport, football," says Tomáš Buriánek, a sports expert at the consulting company Moore Czech Republic. Czech esports has a potential worth hundreds of millions. If Czech esports were to follow the global growth trend of 10 to 12% per year, the number of active players and fans would reach 550 to 600 thousand in five years. The amount of money flowing through esports annually would also grow. Currently, according to Moore Czech Republic, it amounts to approximately 250 million crowns, consisting of income from technological support, advertising, and sponsorship. "The popularity of esports is constantly increasing, and major companies, for example from the technology sector, are entering the industry. In this context, the Czech market could reach 600 million crowns in 2025. It is already outgrowing or has the potential to outgrow many conventional sports, and that – unlike regular sports – currently without support at the national level," explains Marcela Hrdá, a member of the management of Moore Czech Republic. Supporting the competitiveness of Czech esports In neighboring Germany, esports is already among the common sports, because esports clubs here have gained the status of non-profit organizations. This clarified tax and donation relationships and opened the way for clubs to receive financial support. "The Czech Republic could be inspired by this example in order to be competitive in this rapidly developing industry in the future. The inclusion of esports among the Olympic sports is not ruled out, which would significantly contribute to its further global development. The world of video games is particularly attractive for younger age categories, but esports is barrier-free and can be played at an older age. Its growth potential in connection to other industries is therefore enormous," adds Petr Šimoník, president of the Czech Electronic Sport Association. The aim of the CESA association is to create a stable and ethical environment for esports in the Czech Republic and to promote an initiative under which esports will be recognized by state institutions as a fully-fledged sport. This also involves the formalization of the environment and the definition of who is an esports player.

**Summary:**

Esports is experiencing global growth, surpassing traditional sports in viewership and attracting significant investment. In the Czech Republic, esports directly or indirectly impacts approximately three million people, with a core of 350,000 active players and fans – exceeding registered football players. The Czech esports market currently generates around 250 million crowns annually through technology, advertising, and sponsorships and could reach 600 million crowns by 2025, growing faster than traditional sports due to its appeal to younger audiences and accessibility across age groups. The Czech Electronic Sport Association (CESA) aims to formalize the esports environment and gain official recognition as a sport by state institutions. Drawing inspiration from Germany, where esports clubs have non-profit status, CESA seeks to create a stable, ethical environment and enhance the competitiveness of Czech esports on the global stage. The potential inclusion of esports in the Olympics would further fuel its global development.

  <h2>Pandemic strengthened the need to prepare officials for working from home. Equipment, security and training will cost tens of billions.</h2>
  <p class="date">27.07.2020</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_123" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

The pandemic situation, which saw many company activities move online, helped accelerate changes in their operating models. Companies, in addition to seeking new distribution and sales channels, introduced mandatory or recommended "home office" work. However, the transition of officials to work from home in the state administration was often complicated, sometimes almost impossible. "Changing the operating model is much easier in the private sector than in government offices. Companies can relatively easily replace or modify their IT systems and ICT infrastructure or change their processes. In the public administration environment, such a change is more complex, both in terms of available technology, in terms of information security requirements, but also due to the inability to react quickly in the event of the need to modify the ICT infrastructure," says Miloslav Rut, ICT director of the consulting company Moore Czech Republic, and adds: "Often, some documents must not leave the buildings of government offices. And besides, the legislation for the work-from-home option is still not fully specified." Billions will be needed to strengthen the digitalization of government offices. Although the public administration has been working on its digitalization for several years, it became clear during the unexpected emergency that the offices were not fully prepared for remote work. The pandemic has therefore accelerated plans to strengthen both the cybersecurity of government offices and the infrastructure itself, so that it is capacious enough for similar future needs. "In addition to strengthening security, it is necessary to equip public administration workers with appropriate technology, or to further train them to work via remote access. Although the state had already anticipated these procedures, cybersecurity was not its priority, unfortunately, this need has now emerged all the more clearly," explains Miloslav Rut, and adds: "Massive strengthening of information and communication technologies in the public sector will require significant investments in both information technologies themselves and human resources. However, if this area does not become a priority for public administration leaders, but is always addressed reactively as a response to the paralysis of the functioning of an institution, significant damage caused by cybercrime can be expected in the near future." The transition to the concept of a virtual office is a project for several years. In addition to the appropriate technologies and procedures for working from home in the state sphere, modern single-purpose administrative applications are also missing, which can help to efficiently solve the automatic processing of some administrative processes of offices. "According to our estimates, the implementation of modernization and automation of internal processes of offices, so that they can function remotely to the full extent in the event of a similar loss of personal contact, will take several years. In addition to the necessary changes to some laws and internal regulations, it is also necessary to allow for some time to select suppliers and, of course, to implement it," adds Zdeněk Zajíček, chairman of the ICT Union. It has long been involved in the digitalization of public administration, for example with the 202020 initiative, which prepared the Act on the Right to Digital Service.

**Summary:**

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the stark contrast between the private and public sectors' ability to adapt to remote work. While private companies swiftly adjusted their IT systems and processes, the state administration faced significant hurdles due to outdated infrastructure, rigid information security requirements, and legislative uncertainties surrounding remote work. Miloslav Rut of Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the need for substantial investment in upgrading cybersecurity, equipping public servants with necessary technology, and providing remote access training. The alternative would be potential damage from cybercrime. Zdeněk Zajíček of the ICT Union estimates that fully modernizing and automating internal processes for remote operation will take several years, requiring legislative changes, supplier selection, and implementation. The ICT Union advocates for the digitalization of public administration and underscores the long-term commitment required to achieve a fully functional virtual office.

  <h2>Mass Home Office Led to Up to a Third Decrease in Productivity for Companies, Cybersecurity is Also a Problem</h2>
  <p class="date">17.05.2020</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_124" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

An internal analysis by consulting company Moore Czech Republic among its clients reveals a decline in productivity due to long-term home office. The analysis showed that employee productivity decreased by approximately 10% in March. Contrary to expectations of adaptation, efficiency continued to decline in April, averaging a third less compared to normal levels, according to Petr Kymlička, a partner at Moore Czech Republic. This is mainly because entire teams had to transition to home office regardless of whether their work was suitable for this method. The analysis also highlights risks to cybersecurity due to the use of unsecured applications like Zoom for communication and the unsuitable home environment, which often prevents working with sensitive data or conducting confidential conference calls. Many Czech company employees had to adapt to managing their regular work agenda from home at the beginning of March.

**Summary:**

A study by Moore Czech Republic indicates a significant drop in employee productivity due to prolonged remote work. Initially, productivity fell by 10% in March, and despite hopes for adaptation, it further declined by an average of 33% in April compared to pre-pandemic levels. This decline is largely attributed to the forced transition of entire teams to home offices, irrespective of the suitability of their roles for remote work. The firm's Petr Kymlička highlighted this unexpected trend. The analysis also identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities stemming from the use of unsecure communication platforms like Zoom and the challenging home environment, which compromises the secure handling of confidential information and the execution of sensitive conference calls. These findings underscore the challenges Czech companies faced in adapting to the sudden shift to widespread remote work at the beginning of March and the resulting impact on overall efficiency and security.

  <h2>CYBERSECURITY</h2>
  <p class="date">15.04.2020</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_125" class="summary">
    Fake IT specialists sent to companies under false pretenses were granted access to employee files in every instance. Approximately 70% of tested subjects were also deceived by phishing attacks, which involved fraudulent messages requesting sensitive data. Servodata conducted cybersecurity tests among its clients in the past year to assess employees' adherence to standard IT security measures.

The company's experts carried out a series of phishing attacks to fraudulently extract sensitive data from employees or infiltrate software into the client's system, succeeding in 70% of attempts. Furthermore, they employed "baiting," leaving flash drives in offices. In 60% of cases, employees plugged these drives into their computers, despite not knowing their origin or contents, which could have contained malicious software. According to Miroslav Kvapil, CEO of Servodata, these tests highlight significant vulnerabilities in employee awareness and adherence to basic cybersecurity protocols within organizations.

  <h2>Corporate bonds</h2>
  <p class="date">02.04.2020</p>
  <hr/>
  <p id="summary_126" class="summary">
    **Translation:**

Companies are increasingly issuing bonds in smaller volumes to finance specific projects. This trend aligns the Czech Republic with Western countries, and experts predict that the structure and utilization of bonds will be comparable to Western practices in approximately seven to ten years. The Czech corporate bond market saw a significant shift in 2016, with the number of securities increasing from nearly 4,000 to over 13,000. By the end of 2019, this number had doubled.

Companies, particularly those previously unsuccessful in securing bank loans due to short operating histories or inability to provide collateral, have embraced bond financing. Petr Kymlička, partner at Moore Czech Republic, notes that banks are tightening lending conditions. While some companies might qualify for loans, they find bonds to be a simpler and faster alternative. Unlike bank loans, which are often phased and earmarked for specific activities, bonds offer flexibility, providing capital without the requirement to demonstrate its specific use.

Corporate bonds often offer yields ranging from 5% to 11%, but higher yields correlate with increased risk of default. Moore Czech Republic estimates that up to 20% of issuers may struggle to meet their obligations, a situation potentially exacerbated by the current economic climate caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

In Western markets like Germany and France, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dominate bond issuance. In Germany, SMEs now account for over half of the issuances in the Schuldschein Market, reversing the trend from 2012 when large firms dominated. The shift is even more pronounced in the French Euro-PP Market, where SMEs increased their share from 37% in 2012 to 85% in 2016.

**Summary:**

The Czech Republic's corporate bond market is evolving, with companies increasingly issuing smaller bond volumes for specific projects, mirroring Western practices. Experts predict convergence with Western bond markets within a decade. This shift is driven by stricter bank lending conditions, making bonds a more accessible and flexible financing option, especially for companies with limited credit history or collateral. While corporate bonds offer attractive yields, default risks exist, potentially intensified by the ongoing pandemic. In contrast to the past, and similar to Germany and France, small and medium-sized enterprises are becoming key players in the bond market.

**Refined Summary:**

Czech companies are increasingly turning to smaller bond issuances for specific projects, aligning with Western market trends. Experts anticipate full convergence within a decade, driven by stricter bank lending criteria that make bonds a more accessible and flexible financing option. SMEs, often unable to secure traditional bank loans, are leading this shift. While corporate bonds offer attractive yields, investors face default risks, potentially heightened by the pandemic's economic impact. Echoing trends in Germany and France, SMEs are rapidly becoming dominant players in the Czech corporate bond market.
