      <p class="full-content" id="full0" style="display:none;">The Slovak Republic has amended its law on securities and investment services to align with the establishment of the European Single Access Point (ESAP). ESAP provides centralized access to publicly available information on financial services, capital markets, and sustainability. The amendment also includes mandatory reporting on crypto-assets for payment and investment purposes, related to the DAC8 Directive.<br><br>ESAP, operated by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), will increase administrative requirements for businesses and public administration to improve product and market transparency. Various entities involved in securities trading and capital market activities must submit specific information to ESAP, including descriptions of legal forms and organizational structures, takeover bid details, shareholder engagement policies, and covered bond information.<br><br>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) will also be required to disclose information about remedial measures, penalties, and forced administration of securities traders, starting after January 9, 2030.<br><br>Certain companies, such as banks, insurance companies, and listed companies exceeding specific size criteria, will be required to submit financial statements, audit reports, annual reports, sustainability reports, and assurance reports to ESAP through a specialized portal operated by the financial directorate. This differs from the current accounting register, where all accounting entities submit documents. The amendment incorporates ESAP obligations into the Commercial Code, the Banking Act, and the Accounting Act. Further details on the ESAP procedure are available on the European ESAP portal.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full2" style="display:none;">The European Commission has updated its list of high-risk countries with strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes, known as the "grey" and "black" lists. EU entities subject to AML regulations must apply enhanced due diligence to transactions involving these countries. This system protects the EU's financial system.<br><br>The updated "grey list" sees the removal of the United Arab Emirates, Barbados, Gibraltar, Jamaica, Panama, the Philippines, Senegal, and Uganda, signaling the EU's recognition of their improved AML/CFT frameworks and regulatory controls. This delisting brings benefits such as reduced regulatory scrutiny, smoother cross-border operations, and sustained international financial competitiveness. Croatia, Mali, and Tanzania have also been removed from the monitoring list. The complete list of countries under increased surveillance is published by the FATF.<br><br>The "black list" includes North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar (Burma), countries with the most severe strategic deficiencies in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The FATF urges member states to apply enhanced due diligence and, in serious cases, countermeasures to protect the international financial system. The next assessment will be published after the plenary meeting in October 2025.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full3" style="display:none;">The Slovak Parliament has approved a government bill introducing a 6-month amnesty for deregistering non-existent vehicles. Currently, a €500 fee is required for deregistering vehicles that no longer exist, contributing to the Environmental Fund for waste processing from vehicle scrapping.<br><br>The legislation, linked to waste management regulations, mandates this fee if a vehicle ceased to exist before deregistration or if the owner cannot prove its disposal.<br><br>A temporary reduction of the fee is introduced, decreasing it from €500 to €50 for a limited period between July 15, 2025, and January 14, 2026, due to an exception granted by the EU. During this time, the procedures outlined in the Ministry of Environment's regulation regarding waste recycling contributions from vehicles will be suspended. The obligation to apply for a decision on the non-existence of a vehicle does not apply to inherited vehicles. Contact information for further assistance is provided.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full4" style="display:none;">In early June 2025, the Slovak Parliament approved a government bill amending the excise duty law on electricity, coal, and natural gas. The aim is to reduce administrative burdens for consumers during registration, adapt legislation to current trends, and promote electronic processes.<br><br>The amendment introduces new definitions like "electricity company," "electricity supplier," "gas company," and "gas supplier." It exempts from taxation electricity produced or consumed by an entity with a total installed capacity not exceeding 5 MWh, excluding electricity generated from coal, natural gas, or mineral oil.<br><br>The bill mandates registration for authorized consumers of tax-exempt electricity, coal, and natural gas. Applicants must provide details on usage, consumption volume, meter number, business license, and a declaration confirming the electricity's exclusive use for specified purposes. The Bratislava Customs Office must process applications within 30 days. Suppliers cannot provide tax-exempt electricity to authorized consumers without a permit, except for household end-users.<br><br>The law specifies conditions under which the right to use tax-exempt electricity ceases, including business registry deletion, bankruptcy, liquidation, repeated misuse, or failure to pay penalties. The definition and tax rates for natural gas are updated, differentiating rates based on usage: heating fuel (€1.32/MWh), motor fuel (€9.36/MWh), and other purposes (€1.32/MWh). The law takes effect on July 1, 2025.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The Slovak Parliament passed an amendment to the excise duty law on electricity, coal, and natural gas, effective July 1, 2025. This aims to simplify registration for consumers, modernize the legislation, and encourage digital processes within the energy sector. Key changes include new definitions for energy companies and suppliers, an electricity tax exemption for small producers (under 5 MWh), and mandatory registration for authorized consumers using tax-exempt energy. Applicants must provide usage details and ensure compliance. The Bratislava Customs Office is responsible for permit processing. The law outlines conditions for permit termination, such as business closure or misuse. Furthermore, the law updates the definition of natural gas and sets differentiated tax rates based on its usage as heating or motor fuel. This amendment seeks to streamline procedures, prevent misuse, and adapt to evolving energy practices.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full5" style="display:none;">In late May, the Slovak Parliament approved a bill introducing a "super deduction" for investments in sports, aiming to incentivize private sector funding. Modeled after similar schemes in research and development, it seeks to boost private resources in the sports sector.<br><br>The super deduction, detailed in new legislation, allows corporations and self-employed individuals with business income to deduct expenses related to sports activities, alongside existing sponsorship options. Key conditions include a positive tax base, documented expenses in accounting, and ineligibility for public benefit organizations also claiming tax relief as registered social enterprises.<br><br>The deduction is capped at 50% of expenses, up to €250,000 per tax period. Non-monetary contributions to sports organizations are considered tax-deductible, even if lacking direct connection to taxable income. The Financial Administration will publish lists of taxpayers utilizing the deduction and the sports organizations they support.<br><br>Eligible expenses must be separately accounted for and exclude those receiving public funding. Only non-monetary contributions, sports equipment and facilities, are covered. Concurrently, the bill modifies income tax exemptions for trainers, capping tax-free income at €300 per month from all employers. A corresponding deductible item for social insurance is also defined. Sports support expenses are tax-deductible only after payment and following sponsorship rules.<br><br>The amendment takes effect on January 1, 2026, impacting income from that period onward, including adjustments to payroll forms to accommodate the new income category for tax-exempt trainer earnings.</p>

Clarification of income types for athletes and sports experts, effective January 1, 2026, categorizing certain incomes as self-employment income. Amateur athletes under contract may be considered as performing dependent work. Increased support for rental housing, allowing employers to contribute up to €5.23/m2 for state-supported rental housing, adjusted annually for inflation, with specific conditions for eligibility. Finally, the assessment of product safety for tax expense purposes now aligns with the European Parliament and Council regulation on general product safety, requiring companies to use EU methodology when defining hazardous inventory.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full7" style="display:none;">The Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) has adopted the DAC9 directive, an EU initiative aimed at enhancing administrative cooperation in tax matters. This directive establishes a framework for exchanging information on the minimum effective taxation of corporate income among EU member states, marking a significant advancement from the initial proposal of October 28, 2024. DAC9 aims to improve tax cooperation and ensure compliance for multinational and large domestic groups, aligning with the G20/OECD's Pillar II framework.<br><br>A key feature is the implementation of a standardized Globe Information Return (GIR) form, expected to be released in January 2025, facilitating the automatic exchange of tax-related information. It also aims to prevent tax base erosion and profit shifting, enforce minimum taxation for multinationals, and ensure adherence to Pillar II rules. The directive streamlines reporting for large corporations and improves information exchange between tax authorities. DAC9 confirms the international move toward a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits for large multinational and domestic groups with annual revenues of at least EUR 750 million.<br><br>The GIR form is designed to report necessary tax information for ensuring the proper functioning of the minimum corporate income tax rate system and includes a TTIR (Supplementary Tax Information Return) format. The TTIR enables tax administrations to assess risks and accurately evaluate tax liabilities. Multinational companies can file a centralized TTIR for the entire group through the ultimate parent entity or a designated filing entity. Member states must transpose the directive into national law by December 31, 2025, with the directive taking effect on January 1, 2026, and the first information exchange occurring by June 30, 2026.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full8" style="display:none;">The Slovak Ministry of Environment is developing an Authorisation Management Module for the CBAM registry. Official applications can be submitted from March 31, 2025. Importers of goods from third countries subject to carbon border adjustment face increased legislative adjustments affecting customs processes. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) applies to specific goods entering the EU from third countries, including cement, electricity, fertilizers, iron, steel, and hydrogen, as well as materials needed for their production. It targets direct emissions from production processes and indirect emissions from electricity used during production. Exemptions include goods valued under 150 EUR and goods in travelers' personal luggage not exceeding this value.<br><br>Importers or their indirect customs representatives must apply for CBAM-approved declarant status, valid across the EU. The EU recommends early application due to a potentially lengthy approval process (up to 180 days). Registration is advised before importing goods subject to CBAM from January 1, 2026.<br><br>Obligations include applying for CBAM-approved declarant status via the CBAM registry, reporting any changes to the registry, submitting quarterly reports on imported goods and their emissions during the transitional period (October 1, 2023 – December 31, 2025), and after this period, possessing CBAM certificates equal to the carbon value of the imported goods. Annual reports are due by May 31st each year. Records must be kept for four years. Penalties exist for non-compliance, including fines of 100 EUR per ton of CO2 equivalent and potential import suspension.</p>

      <h2>American Tariffs 2025: Global Consequences of Trump's Trade Policy</h2>
      <p class="date">23.05.2025</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary11">In early April, President Trump announced extensive tariffs on imports to the US, including a 10% base tariff on nearly all imports, a 20% tariff on EU imports (temporarily reduced to 10% until July 9</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full11" style="display:none;">In early April, President Trump announced extensive tariffs on imports to the US, including a 10% base tariff on nearly all imports, a 20% tariff on EU imports (temporarily reduced to 10% until July 9, 2025), a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, and specific tariffs on Japan, South Korea, and India. These measures, enacted under the IEEPA, bypass Congress.<br><br>Additional tariffs introduced in April and May 2025 include a 25% tariff on auto parts and a 100% tariff on foreign films. These tariffs raise concerns about disrupted global supply chains and increased consumer prices. The Netherlands anticipates a 0.4% GDP decrease in 2025. The EU offered to purchase €50 billion in US products to ease tensions.<br><br>The trade war significantly impacts the EU economy, particularly Germany. A 25% tariff could reduce the Eurozone’s GDP by 1% in 2025. Companies like Mercedes-Benz and Unilever report reduced consumer confidence and supply chain issues, with some, like Stellantis and Volvo Cars, withdrawing financial forecasts. Central European countries with strong automotive and steel industries, such as Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, are heavily affected.<br><br>The EU is diversifying trade relationships, negotiating agreements with countries like India, the UK, and Australia, and has formed a "Trump Task Force" to address potential escalations. The EU is also investing in strategic sectors like semiconductors and renewable energy. The EU is open to negotiations for zero tariffs on industrial products and is preparing retaliatory measures worth €21 billion.<br><br>The automotive, pharmaceutical, consumer goods, and film industries face significant challenges. The 100% tariff on foreign films may weaken international collaboration and disrupt capital flow. EU companies are encouraged to diversify export markets, relocate production, utilize EU trade agreements, optimize supply chains, and use customs warehouses. Consulting firms can provide support in navigating these challenges.<br><br>The US has reached its first trade agreement post-tariff implementation with the UK, focusing on strengthening collaboration in the agricultural and food industries. The agreement aims to facilitate the import of UK autos, steel, and aluminum, and the export of US beef.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full12" style="display:none;">The Slovak Ministry of Finance announced upcoming changes to VAT deductions, specifically concerning personal vehicles used for both business and private purposes, and modifications to the VAT return form due to legislative changes regarding goods imported into the country.<br><br>Effective July 1, 2025, VAT deductions for personal vehicles (categories M1, L1e, and L3e) used for both business and private use will be limited to a flat 50%, regardless of the actual split between business and personal use. This applies to vehicle purchases, leases, and operating costs. Exceptions exist for vehicles exclusively used for business purposes like resale, rental, passenger transport, driving schools, and replacement vehicles, provided private use is negligible. This limitation is set to last from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2028, with a possible extension.<br><br>A new VAT return form will also be implemented on July 1, 2025, to accommodate changes related to VAT obligations for taxpayers submitting customs declarations for imported goods subject to self-assessment, specifically when goods are released for free circulation or placed under temporary use with partial import duty exemption. The new form separates sections for tax liability and tax deduction, including specific lines for different VAT rates and categories, such as domestic goods and services, intra-community acquisitions, and imported goods. The Financial Administration will publish the new form by the end of June 2025.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full14" style="display:none;">Effective from 2025, the withholding tax rate on profit distributions to Slovak resident individuals will change. This affects income paid in the 2025 tax period, which will be distributed in 2026 or later. The primary change is a decrease in the tax rate from 10% to 7%. This rate is determined solely by the year the profit distribution pertains to, impacting companies distributing profits from corporations or cooperatives.<br><br>The tax base is the gross profit distribution without expense deductions. The distributing entity is the tax payer, responsible for withholding and remitting the tax to the administrator by the 15th of the following month, using account number 500267/8180. They must also submit notification form OZNA4311v21 electronically. If the profit is distributed in installments, a separate notification is required for each month. Correct withholding and remittance exempts the profit distribution from further tax liability for the recipient, who doesn't need to declare this in their tax return. However, the company bears responsibility for accuracy. Non-profit organizations, not registered for corporate income tax, are exempt.<br><br>For companies distributing profits to partners, this impacts decisions regarding net dividend amounts. Companies must also plan cash flow to ensure funds are available for tax payments by the 15th of the following month. Profits from 2023 are taxed at 7%, 2024 profits at 10%, and 2025 profits at 7%.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full15" style="display:none;">The approved consolidation package introduces changes to the allocation of a portion of paid income tax, effective January 1, 2025, impacting tax returns filed for 2024. The goal is to streamline the process, enhance transparency, and reduce the administrative burden on recipients of the 2% share. A significant impact is on citizens who previously used this share as monetary compensation for parental pension provided by their working children.<br><br>The allocation of this tax share for parental pensions will be managed by the Social Insurance Agency, using data from the Financial Directorate based on declarations or tax returns. The first payment under this new system will occur in 2026, based on data from 2025. Individuals can allocate 2% of their paid income tax (minus any tax bonus), provided the recipient (parent) is a beneficiary of old-age pension, disability pension received at retirement age, or similar benefits. The tax share can be allocated to one or both parents, with equal distribution. Legal entities cannot allocate their tax share as parental pension.<br><br>The Social Insurance Agency will assess eligibility for the original parental pension according to regulations in effect until December 31, 2024, in connection with old-age pension eligibility. The law change does not affect taxpayers' right to allocate their tax share to both parents (pensioners) and the non-profit sector. Individuals can allocate 2% each to their mother and father, and an additional 2% or 3% to non-profits, potentially allocating a total of 7% of their paid tax share, with a minimum tax amount of 3 EUR for each allocation. If the share is below 3 EUR, no refund will be provided.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full17" style="display:none;">The transaction tax is changing how businesses handle their finances, and not for the better. Companies are now minimizing transfers, consolidating payments, and adjusting cash flow rhythms.

      <p class="full-content" id="full20" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic announced new meal allowance rates for employees, effective April 1, 2025. These rates are dependent on the length of the business trip. Employers must provide meal arrangements in advance, meaning new meal vouchers or electronic card recharges must be issued before this date. The rates are increasing as follows: for trips of 5-12 hours, the allowance rises from €8.30 to €8.80; for 12-18 hours, from €12.30 to €13.10; and for trips exceeding 18 hours, from €18.40 to €19.50. The maximum employer contribution to meals will be €4.84 (55% of €8.80), and the minimum meal voucher value will be €6.60 (75% of €8.80). The financial contribution to meals will be between €3.63 and €4.84. Employers will need to adjust travel expense calculations, update internal regulations, and inform employees about the changes. Payroll systems must be updated to reflect the new rates. This adjustment aims to better cover employee expenses during business trips due to the rising cost of living. Proper implementation is crucial for compliance with legislation.</p>

      <h2>OMNIBUS: A New Approach to Sustainability and ESG in the European Union</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full22" style="display:none;">In March 2025, the European Commission introduced the OMNIBUS I proposal to simplify sustainability and ESG reporting. The changes aim to reduce the number of companies subject to CSRD by approximately 80%, significantly decreasing administrative burdens while maintaining the EU's commitment to sustainability. The Commission estimates savings of €6.3 billion in annual administrative costs and the mobilization of €50 billion in public and private investment to support policy priorities.<br><br>OMNIBUS is a set of legislative amendments covering environmental regulations and sustainability disclosure requirements, promoting transparency and accountability. Key points include mandating detailed environmental and social activity reporting, harmonizing ESG disclosure rules for easier performance comparison, and extending reporting obligations to larger SMEs. These changes affect firms trading in the European market, making sustainability compliance essential for competitiveness.<br><br>Key elements of OMNIBUS I include simplified disclosure rules through standardized ESG reporting guidelines, reporting obligations for firms with over 250 employees or €40 million turnover, stricter compliance control and penalties, and a focus on ecological factors. Businesses face advantages like better transparency, improved image, and access to new markets, but also challenges such as increased compliance costs and complex adaptation to new norms. SMEs face challenges in adapting, data collection, and limited administrative capacities.<br><br>The OMNIBUS proposal simplifies the management and transparency of sustainability, requiring EU firms to prepare for new regulations.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full29" style="display:none;">The Slovak government has adopted an amendment to the building law, necessitating adjustments to several laws related to business and tax obligations for individuals and legal entities in Slovakia. Key changes include amendments to the Trades Licensing Act, the Law on Warehouse Receipts, the Income Tax Act, and the Law on Local Taxes.<br><br>The Trades Licensing Act now excludes authorized urban planners, control engineers, and construction supervisors from being considered trades. Using technical equipment at stalls or portable devices no longer requires a construction permit. Trade licenses for documentation and project work on simple constructions obtained before April 1, 2025, remain valid until March 31, 2029. The act also updates the list of trades and requirements for construction trades.<br><br>The Law on Warehouse Receipts mandates that warehouse keepers notify the ministry within 15 days of any changes affecting their license to operate a public warehouse. The calculation period no longer starts from the issuing date of the warehouse permit.<br><br>The Income Tax Act redefines "buildings and other structures" that are not considered buildings for depreciation purposes, specifically addressing small structures on forest lands. It also defines the depreciation of building complexes, where each structure within the complex is depreciated separately. A transitional provision states that for buildings with proceedings initiated and completed by March 31, 2025, the original regulations apply.<br><br>The Law on Local Taxes modifies the definition of a building plot for property tax calculation. It defines a building plot as one specified in a valid building permit until the occupancy permit is issued. It also specifies what is not considered a building plot. Tax obligations arising before December 31, 2025, will still follow the regulations effective until March 31, 2025. Valid building permits and occupancy permits under previous regulations are now considered decisions on construction projects and occupancy certificates, respectively.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full30" style="display:none;">Slovakia has amended its law on the minimum tax level, also known as the equalization tax, to address several contentious areas in the initial transposition. The amendment, which modifies Act No. 507/2023, clarifies definitions, supplements rules for calculating excluded income based on economic substance, and introduces simplified calculations for insignificant entities (state and non-profit entities).<br><br>Key changes include adjustments to definitions of "included tax of a basic entity," "qualified imputation tax," "unqualified refundable imputation tax," and "marketable minimum price." The definition of "parent entity" has also been refined, distinguishing between "non-excluded main parent entity," "intermediate parent entity," and "partially owned parent entity." The amendment further elaborates on rules for income inclusion, under-taxed profits, and domestic equalization taxes.<br><br>The new law significantly alters the calculation of eligible income or loss, allowing for the inclusion of profits or losses determined according to acceptable financial standards if the basic entity's financial statements are prepared accordingly, information is reliable, and permanent differences exceed EUR 1,000,000. It also provides guidance on the treatment of currency gains and adjustments to included taxes. Tax credits are addressed, and rules for excluding income based on economic substance have been expanded to cover tangible asset rentals, dependent activities, and income from tangible assets. Hybrid measures aimed at preventing tax avoidance are introduced, and exceptions for simplified calculations are outlined for entities meeting specific criteria. The effective dates for determining eligible income or loss and applying deferred tax assets have been postponed to January 1, 2025.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full31" style="display:none;">Several legal amendments concerning counter-terrorism financing, asylum, and health insurance were enacted in late 2024 in Slovakia.<br><br>Amendments to the law against money laundering focus on strengthening the legal framework against illegal financial flows, improving prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, and enhancing international cooperation. Key changes include stricter requirements for businesses, especially financial institutions, in identifying clients and monitoring suspicious transactions, with increased attention to cryptocurrency transactions, trusts, partnerships, individuals from high-risk countries, life insurance beneficiaries, ultimate beneficial owners, and clients of pan-European pension products. New rules impose obligations on cryptocurrency platforms for thorough checks and transparency. Penalties for illegal activities are increased, and international cooperation is emphasized.<br><br>Amendments to the law on the residence of foreigners and asylum aim to streamline temporary refuge status and asylum policy in line with EU standards. They focus on optimizing administrative procedures, improving conditions for asylum seekers, and strengthening their rights. Key changes include adjusted conditions for long-term residence, new conditions for work and study stays, increased monitoring of foreigners' residence, and simplified procedures for third-country nationals, introducing electronic application submissions for residence-related matters, with the caveat that biometric data must already be on file. The asylum law amendments focus on streamlining asylum proceedings, increasing protection for asylum seekers' rights, improving processes for repeated asylum applications, and introducing new rules for children and families.<br><br>Finally, changes to health insurance stipulate public health insurance will cease under specific conditions (no general practitioner, no healthcare provided/claimed/communicated within 5 years, no change in provider within 5 years), and that state will pay for health insurance in cases where a person is engaged in community service. It also amended the law on health insurance companies, for which economically eligible costs are defined, and the term technical reserve is replaced by the term cost of insurance benefits.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full32" style="display:none;">Several legislative changes are set to impact the business environment in Slovakia, effective primarily from January 1, 2025.<br><br>Amendments to the VAT Act include new conditions for mandatory VAT registration, such as supplying buildings or building parts, supplying goods via electronic interfaces to non-taxable individuals within the EU, and acquiring goods from other member states with an established permanent establishment in Slovakia. The basis for VAT calculation is also redefined. It will be based on the purchase price of the goods or the cost of the service at the time of supply. The adjustment period for VAT on investment property is specified as 5 calendar years for movable assets exceeding €3,319.39 and 20 years for buildings and related constructions.<br><br>The Electronic Cash Register Act sees a significant increase in penalties for violations. For example, improper use of the cash register now carries a fine of €500-€15,000.<br><br>Amendments to the Business Act prohibit legal entities with unscrupulous beneficial owners from engaging in real estate brokerage and accounting services. Companies must adjust legal relationships with final beneficiaries by April 15, 2025. The act also reduces administrative burdens by allowing state institutions to electronically exchange information already provided by entrepreneurs.<br><br>The Customs Act increases fines for customs offenses.<br><br>Finally, there are amendments to the Act on the Implementation of International Sanctions, detailing the responsibilities of state administration employees. The Act on Financial Administration is also amended, granting financial authorities the right to control cash transfers across borders shared with other member states exceeding €10,000, and to seize the entire amount if information is withheld. Fines for failing to declare cash transfers above this limit will also apply.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full33" style="display:none;">Extensive discussions regarding the content and interpretation of the new financial transaction tax led to pressure on lawmakers and the need for revisions to the law. Before Law No. 279/2024 Coll. on the financial transaction tax took effect, an amendment was approved in late November 2024.<br><br>The amendment clarifies definitions, specifying that cash deposits to payment accounts, issuing payment instruments, money transfers, and payment initiation services are not financial transactions. It also refines the definition of a transaction account, limiting it to accounts used by entrepreneurs, and clarifies who is considered a taxpayer, including payment service users with a registered office or business establishment in Slovakia.<br><br>The amendment expands the list of exempt entities to include organizations like Matica slovenská, the Slovak Academy of Sciences, civic associations, churches, and regional tourism organizations. These entities must notify the tax collector (payment service provider) that they are not taxpayers. The definition of the tax payer also includes payment service users and providers without a local organizational unit.<br><br>The range of tax-exempt transactions is also broadened to encompass activities related to crypto-assets, payment operations performed by postal companies, automated balance compensation within consolidated groups, transactions involving funds under bankruptcy or execution proceedings, auction deposits, payments by state funds, payments of administrative and court fees, transactions by public universities and transactions of supervised financial market actors conducted on behalf of their clients. Furthermore, transactions for healthcare insurance, medicine, prepayments, and sanctions are also exempted.<br><br>Finally, the calculation of the tax base for re-invoiced costs is specified, and the tax rate of 0.4% (max. 40 EUR) applies to financial transactions debited from the taxpayer's account, financial transactions that relate to the domestic activities of the taxpayer and which another person invoiced to him and the amount of the re-invoiced costs related to the implementation of a financial transaction, which relates to the domestic activity of the taxpayer. The amendments take effect on January 1, 2025.</p>

      <h2>Deforestation Regulation – the so-called EUDR Regulation</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full35" style="display:none;">The European Parliament adopted the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) to combat deforestation, forest degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. This regulation aims to control the import, export, and marketing of specific products linked to environmental damage.<br><br>The EUDR applies to all EU companies involved in importing or exporting designated products. Non-compliance results in a ban on trading these products. The regulation focuses on commodities like cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soy, and wood, and products derived from them. The specific list is in Annex I of the regulation.<br><br>The EUDR places obligations on economic operators (importers, exporters, domestic producers) and traders. They are prohibited from placing or making available on the market commodities and products that caused deforestation or forest degradation, are not compliant with the laws of the country of production, and are not covered by a due diligence statement. Economic operators must exercise due diligence, issue a due diligence statement, communicate within the supply chain, and large companies must publish annual due diligence reports.<br><br>Due diligence involves gathering information, assessing risks (considering factors like country risk level, deforestation rates, and supply chain complexity), and implementing risk mitigation measures. Wood products with a valid FLEGT license are deemed compliant.<br><br>Small and medium-sized enterprises have lighter obligations, only needing to collect information on suppliers and customers. A representative can be appointed for microenterprises. Failure to comply can result in penalties, including fines of up to 4% of the company's annual EU turnover.<br><br>The EUDR came into force on June 29, 2023, and will be applied from December 2024, but there is a proposition to postpone the date to December 2025 for large companies and June 2026 for microenterprises and small businesses.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full36" style="display:none;">Social security contributions are a key aspect of your obligations to the state, paid by working citizens, the self-employed, and tradespeople, with adjustments made twice a year. For 2025, changes to the minimum living standard law impact tax limits for individuals. The non-taxable portion of the tax base is EUR 5,753.79 for the taxpayer and EUR 5,260.61 for a spouse, with income tax rates of 19% up to EUR 48,441.43 and 25% above that. A tax return is required if income exceeds EUR 2,876.90.<br><br>Social security contributions are influenced by changes in the average monthly wage in Slovakia, which for 2023 is EUR 1,430. The maximum assessment base for social insurance is EUR 10,010, and the minimum is EUR 715. Minimum social and health insurance contributions for the self-employed are EUR 344.27. Penalties for late payments are 0.05% per day, but only if exceeding EUR 5.<br><br>Tax bonuses for dependents will change in 2025, decreasing to EUR 100 for children under 15, EUR 50 for those under 18, and EUR 0 for those over 18. The minimum wage for 2025 is set at EUR 816 per month or EUR 4.690 per hour, calculated as 57% of the average monthly wage. The minimum wage varies based on the difficulty level of the job, with corresponding coefficients affecting both monthly and hourly rates.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full37" style="display:none;">The Council of ECOFIN recently addressed the issue of non-cooperative countries, often referred to as a "blacklist," which are identified by international organizations and governments for failing to meet standards in tax transparency, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorism financing. Following the October 8, 2024 meeting, Antigua and Barbuda was removed from the blacklist and placed on a grey list due to a review of its current tax status. No new countries were added.<br><br>The current list includes American Samoa, Anguilla, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Vanuatu. A review is scheduled for February 2025.<br><br>Countries end up on the list for reasons such as non-compliance with international standards, refusal to cooperate, and a high risk of money laundering. Consequences include economic sanctions, increased trade costs, and reputational damage. To be removed, countries implement reforms such as transparent tax policies, strengthened banking regulations, and improved anti-money laundering legislation, also committing to international cooperation. Trading with companies based in these countries can trigger scrutiny from Slovak tax authorities.</p>

      <h2>Taxation of Crypto Assets in Slovakia – Changes from 2024/2025</h2>
      <p class="date">06.12.2024</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary38">The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation introduces a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-asset markets across the EU. In Slovakia, Law No. 248/2024 implements MiCA, effective November 1,</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full38" style="display:none;">The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation introduces a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-asset markets across the EU. In Slovakia, Law No. 248/2024 implements MiCA, effective November 1, 2024, addressing crypto-asset custody, advisory services, information obligations, supervision by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS), sanctions, activity restrictions, and blocking online interfaces. The NBS will oversee compliance from June 30, 2024, focusing on licensed entities, although non-supervised entities can operate until June 30, 2026.<br><br>MiCA distinguishes between electronic money tokens (EMTs), asset-referenced tokens (ARTs), and other crypto-assets. Banks or electronic money institutions can offer EMTs from June 30, 2024, after notifying the NBS and submitting a whitepaper. Banks or NBS-licensed entities can offer ARTs from the same date. Other crypto-assets can be offered by legal entities submitting a whitepaper to the NBS from December 30, 2024.<br><br>Amendments to income tax and accounting laws, effective January 1, 2025, address crypto-asset taxation. Issues remain regarding the uniform treatment of diverse crypto-assets. Electronic money tokens are now treated as standard currencies for accounting valuation. Taxable income for individuals from crypto-asset exchanges is subject to 19% or 25% income tax and 15% health insurance contribution. Corporations must record crypto-assets as intangible assets, with taxable income calculated as the difference between purchase and sale prices. Investing in crypto-assets via securities like ETFs may provide income tax exemptions for individuals. Since 2024, detailed reporting of crypto transactions is mandatory.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full40" style="display:none;">The European Parliament adopted Directive 2024/1760 on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDD), aiming to ensure companies operating in the EU take responsibility for their impact on society and the environment. Companies must identify and mitigate adverse effects on human rights, the environment, and good governance throughout their operations and supply chains.<br><br>The directive applies to EU companies with over 1,000 employees and a global turnover exceeding €450 million, as well as non-EU companies with a turnover exceeding €450 million within the EU. It also covers companies with franchising or licensing agreements meeting specific criteria.<br><br>Companies must integrate due diligence into their policies, assess impacts, prevent and mitigate adverse effects, ensure remediation, engage stakeholders, establish grievance mechanisms, monitor due diligence effectiveness, and communicate publicly about their efforts. Subsidiaries must cooperate with parent companies, adhere to due diligence policies, and implement appropriate measures.<br><br>Challenges include establishing control mechanisms, adjusting internal regulations, ensuring data accuracy, and aligning executive compensation with sustainability goals. Benefits include creating a sustainable economy, improving risk assessment, reducing reputational risks, and enhancing access to financing. EU member states are expected to transpose the directive into national law by July 26, 2026, with phased implementation based on company size and turnover.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full41" style="display:none;">The Slovak government has approved amendments to excise duties and introduced a new tax on sweetened beverages, effective January 1, 2025. This tax targets businesses making the first supply of sweetened non-alcoholic drinks containing added sugar or sweeteners in Slovakia. Affected beverages include packaged sweetened non-alcoholic drinks (flavored mineral waters, juices, colas, sweetened non-alcoholic beer, iced coffees, teas), packaged concentrates (syrups, instant and powdered drinks), and energy drinks with over 150mg of caffeine per liter. Exemptions exist for sweetened drinks in medicine form, nutritional supplements, infant formula, and food for specific medical purposes. Tax rates vary: €0.15/liter for packaged drinks, €0.30/liter for high-caffeine drinks, and €1.05/liter or €4.30/kg for concentrates (€2.10/liter or €8.60/kg for high-caffeine concentrates). A rule addresses pre-tax stockpiling for entities audited by auditors, requiring monitoring of acquired sweetened beverage quantities from July to December 2024.<br><br>The excise duty law on tobacco products has also been amended, expanding the range of taxable products to include raw tobacco, smokeless tobacco products, related products, nicotine products and pouches, heated tobacco, and smokeless alternatives (e-cigarettes). These products will require mandatory control markings. Smokeless tobacco products are defined, and their tax base is determined by the quantity of filling in kilograms (for inhalable products) or grams (for non-inhalable products). Specific regulations govern the distribution of smokeless tobacco, requiring permits in certain situations. "Related tobacco products" now encompass e-cigarette refills, nicotine pouches, and other nicotine products. Their sale below the tax amount is prohibited, and they must be marked with "ITV" before sale. Excise duty rates for tobacco products have increased significantly, effective November 1, 2024, with further changes planned for February 2025 and January 2026. However, these future changes may be reconsidered depending on the need for continued fiscal consolidation. The government anticipates expanding excise duties to new tobacco products in the future.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full45" style="display:none;">The Slovak Parliament has approved a new tax on financial transactions, effective from 2025, as part of a consolidation process aimed at increasing state budget revenue. This transaction tax applies to all businesses in Slovakia, regardless of size or status, including companies, banks, healthcare providers, financial service providers, religious organizations, and self-employed individuals.<br><br>The tax applies to all business entities (individuals and legal entities) that are clients of payment service providers conducting financial transactions, but excludes the Social Insurance Agency, state budget organizations, municipalities, and individual citizens.

Taxable transactions include transfers from a business account, card payments, and re-invoiced costs related to business activities in Slovakia. Exempt transactions include receipts of funds, tax and social security payments, reversed payments, securities management, government bond purchases, foreign exchange operations, and intra-bank transfers.<br><br>The tax rate is 0.4% (max €40) for cashless transfers and 0.8% for cash withdrawals, plus €2 per card payment, and 0.4% for re-invoiced costs with a minimum tax of €0.01.

This aims to boost domestic tourism and aid parents with lower incomes. Employers should update internal regulations accordingly, considering GDPR when verifying family status.<br><br>Furthermore, a new amendment, effective August 1, 2024, addresses subcontractor liability to ensure employees receive proper wages. This change, primarily concerning construction work, allows employees of subcontractors to claim unpaid wages up to the minimum wage from the main service provider if their direct employer fails to pay. The claim must be made in writing within six months of the wage due date. The service provider has 30 days to pay upon receiving the claim. The service provider can refuse payment if they can demonstrate they exercised due diligence in selecting the subcontractor and had no reason to foresee wage non-payment, considering factors like the agreed price, overlapping management, lack of illegal employment violations, and financial stability of the subcontractor. Each case will be assessed individually.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full53" style="display:none;">The Slovak Financial Directorate has published information regarding the exemption of income from the sale of shares and business shares according to § 13c of the Income Tax Act. This provision can be applied, under certain conditions, to selected legal entities or permanent establishments of taxpayers with limited tax liability located in Slovakia.<br><br>The exemption applies to the sale of shares by shareholders of joint-stock companies (including similar rights for shareholders of simple joint-stock companies) and business shares of partners in limited liability companies or limited partners in limited partnerships (including similar foreign companies), and tax residents of legal entities and permanent establishments of foreign legal entities in Slovakia. Only income from the sale of shares or business shares owned by a tax resident or a permanent establishment in Slovakia is exempt. Membership rights in cooperatives and business shares in foreign companies when a taxpayer moves abroad are specifically excluded from the exemption.<br><br>To qualify for the exemption, several tests must be met concurrently: a time test (income from the sale must be realized at least 24 months after acquiring a minimum share), a minimum shareholding test (holding at least 10% of the share capital), and a functions and risks test (performing essential functions, managing risks, and having the necessary resources). The exemption does not apply to securities dealers, sellers in liquidation, the sale of treasury shares or sales during restructuring.<br><br>The day of acquisition of the direct share is crucial and varies depending on whether it involves cash or non-cash contributions, purchase, donation, inheritance, business combinations, company transformations, or relocation of the company's registered office to Slovakia. Costs related to the acquisition of shares or business shares are not considered tax-deductible expenses in the tax period of the sale, but this is adjusted in the tax return.<br><br>The information doesn’t fully address the practical implications for holding companies, particularly regarding the functions and risks test, where holding companies often only receive passive income and delegate operational activities and risks to subsidiaries. This can make it difficult for holding companies to qualify for the exemption. Common reasons for the tax administrator rejecting the exemption for holding companies include a lack of defined business risk, extensive material and personnel support, proof of tax residency, and consideration of specific functions and risks appropriate to a holding structure.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full54" style="display:none;">In Slovakia, trade in goods between Slovakia and other EU member states, as well as third countries, is subject to Intrastat reporting. This entails submitting Intrastat declarations for both the receipt and dispatch of goods. These statistical data are utilized by various business and non-business associations for market information.<br><br>Importers and exporters must monitor exemption thresholds for intra-EU trade, regardless of their status. The current thresholds are €1,000,000 for both imports and exports, with specific limits for agriculture and food sectors (€200,000 for imports, €400,000 for exports). Crossing these limits requires registration with the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic.<br><br>Intrastat reporting covers the physical movement of goods between Slovakia and EU member states or third countries, distinguishing between intra-EU imports and exports. It also includes Union goods and goods under customs processing. Exemptions from Intrastat reporting include monetary gold, legal tender, customized data carriers, free advertising materials, goods for repairs, transportation vehicles, goods for temporary use, goods in transit, and goods moving between member states and the country of entry into the EU customs area.<br><br>The obligation arises when the value of goods imported and exported within the EU exceeds the limit from October 1, 2022, to September 30. The deadline for submitting Intrastat declarations is the 15th day of the calendar month following the month the limit was exceeded. The obligation ceases if the limit is not exceeded between October 1 and September 30, resulting in automatic termination or requiring notification to the Statistical Office.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full55" style="display:none;">The amendment to Act No. 530/2023 Z. z. introduces a new obligation for legal entities in Slovakia for the 2024 tax period: a minimum corporate tax. This tax applies to both profitable and loss-making companies.<br><br>The minimum tax is the tax paid after deducting reliefs and foreign tax credits, applicable when the tax liability calculated in the tax return is lower than the minimum tax amount. The minimum tax amount varies based on taxable income: €340 for income up to €50,000, €960 for income between €50,000 and €250,000, €1,920 for income between €250,000 and €500,000, and €3,840 for income over €500,000. Even companies reporting a loss must pay a minimum tax of €340. The tax is halved if at least 20% of the employees are disabled individuals.<br><br>The minimum tax is due by the tax return deadline, March 31, 2025 (or extended deadlines). It can be offset against future tax liabilities for a maximum of three years, provided the tax liability exceeds the minimum tax. However, the offset is forfeited upon company liquidation or bankruptcy.<br><br>Exemptions from the minimum tax include newly established entities, non-profit organizations, sheltered workshops, land associations with limited income, and companies undergoing liquidation.<br><br>Foreign legal entities operating in Slovakia through branches or permanent establishments are also subject to the minimum tax, considering whether they are from treaty or non-treaty countries. Entities from non-treaty countries must pay the minimum tax even if they have no taxable income.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full57" style="display:none;">The Slovak government has approved changes to immigration rules, effective July 15, 2024, impacting employers and foreigners working or planning to work in Slovakia. For temporary residence permits for employment, employers must request confirmation of a vacant position 20 days after reporting it. The labor office will decide on granting permission within 15 working days. Applicants have 90 days to apply for residency and can start working immediately upon submitting a complete application. The residency decision time is reduced from 90 to 60 days, and electronic document submission is now allowed.<br><br>Changing the purpose of residence from employment to entrepreneurship is only possible after 12 months. Students must complete their studies before applying for a change of purpose, otherwise it will not be allowed. National visa applications can be submitted at relevant institutions or external service providers. Visas for residency applications will include information about the type of residence and the employer. National visas for business purposes are no longer obtainable.<br><br>The requirements for the EU Blue Card are eased, lowering the required salary to 1.2 times the average salary or the average salary for recent graduates.

      <p class="full-content" id="full58" style="display:none;">The Slovak Financial Administration has updated its guidelines regarding the process of granting deferrals for tax payments or payment in installments, including the calculation of interest on the deferred amount. These guidelines apply to all types of tax payments, including penalties and tax arrears, but not to tax prepayments.<br><br>To be eligible for a tax deferral or installment plan (excluding highly reliable taxpayers), the taxpayer must demonstrate that paying the tax would endanger their ability to meet their family support obligations, their income has decreased making payment difficult, payment would lead to insolvency, or there are other serious reasons preventing payment. The tax administrator can grant deferrals or installment plans for up to two years, meaning a rejected applicant must wait two years before reapplying.<br><br>The process requires submitting a complete application electronically, proposing an installment plan based on the taxpayer's financial situation, and paying an administrative fee (either €7 or €14 depending on the form of submission). The tax administrator may also require collateral for the debt. Deferrals are granted for a maximum of 24 months from the original due date.<br><br>Interest is calculated on the deferred amount at a rate based on the National Bank of Slovakia's reference rate (currently 4.11%) plus 1%, but if the reference rate is 3% or lower, a fixed rate of 3% applies. The interest is calculated daily for the actual deferral period and is payable within 15 days of the decision becoming final. No interest is charged if it's below €5.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full59" style="display:none;">The EU Council agreed on the FASTER initiative, a directive aiming to enhance the security and efficiency of withholding tax procedures in the EU for cross-border investors, national tax authorities, and financial intermediaries. This addresses double taxation relief and combats tax abuse.<br><br>Currently, EU member states tax dividends and bond interest paid to foreign investors, while their countries of residence also tax these incomes. Differing procedures for withholding tax relief across member states result in complex administrative burdens.<br><br>The directive introduces a common EU digital tax residence certificate, enabling investors to use accelerated withholding tax relief procedures. Member states will automate the issuance of these certificates within 14 days of application.<br><br>The directive allows member states to use either a relief-at-source system, applying the appropriate tax rate at payment, or a quick refund system, guaranteeing tax overpayment refunds within a set timeframe. These accelerated procedures are mandatory for publicly traded share dividends. However, member states can maintain existing procedures if they provide a comprehensive relief-at-source system for publicly traded share dividends and their market capitalization share is below 1.5%.<br><br>Standardized reporting obligations are established for financial intermediaries, facilitating the detection of potential tax fraud. A national register of certified financial intermediaries will be created and linked to a European portal. Intermediaries must report transaction information to tax authorities, subject to national penalties for non-compliance.<br><br>The directive's transposition deadline is December 31, 2028, with national rules applying from January 1, 2030. It primarily concerns dividends from publicly traded securities and bond interest, excluding non-tradable securities and dividends from equity holdings.</p>

      <h2>Harmonization of anti-money laundering rules</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full60" style="display:none;">In late May 2024, the EU Council adopted a package of new Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules stemming from Directive (EU) 2015/849. This shifts private sector rules to a new regulation, while a directive addresses the organization of national AML authorities. The harmonized Directive 2024/1640 protects the EU financial system and promotes security and economic growth. Directive 2024/1620 establishes a supervisory authority for AML activities.<br><br>The new regulation aims to harmonize AML rules across the EU, preventing exploitation of differing national standards. It adapts to technological innovations like virtual currencies, global terrorism, and criminal ingenuity. The rules will apply three years after their July 10, 2024, effective date, allowing member states time for transposition.<br><br>The regulation sets requirements for credit and financial institutions, and designated non-financial businesses like cryptocurrency providers, luxury goods dealers, and potentially professional football clubs and agents. Cryptocurrency providers must conduct customer verification and report suspicious transactions. Dealers in precious metals, gems, luxury cars, and artwork also face verification and reporting obligations.<br><br>The regulation clarifies beneficial ownership, focusing on those who truly control or benefit from a legal entity, setting a 25% ownership threshold. It addresses multi-layered ownership structures and data protection. Cash payments will be capped at €10,000 EU-wide, with member states able to set lower limits. Enhanced due diligence is required for transactions involving high-risk third countries.<br><br>A new EU Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA) will directly and indirectly supervise high-risk financial sector entities. AMLA will oversee risky institutions, support the non-financial sector, coordinate financial intelligence units, and impose penalties. It will impose fines for breaches of AML rules, with penalties based on the benefit gained from the breach or a percentage of annual turnover. AMLA will be located in Frankfurt, Germany, with institutional operations beginning in mid-2025. A Slovakian law is being amended to transpose the Directive, expected to take effect in December 2024.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full61" style="display:none;">In late April 2024, the Slovak Parliament approved an amendment to the Accounting Act, implementing the EU's CSRD Directive on corporate sustainability reporting. Effective June 1, 2024, the amendment aligns with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), ensuring consistent reporting and external auditing of sustainability information.<br><br>Subsidiaries with foreign parent companies must now prepare reports on the sustainability impacts of their business strategies. These reports, part of the annual report, must include auditor verification and disclose both short-term and long-term plans to mitigate global warming and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Key information is categorized into environmental (climate mitigation, adaptation, resources), social and human rights (equal opportunities, working conditions), and administrative factors (governance, ethics).<br><br>The first reporting period begins after January 1, 2024, for banks, insurers, and securities issuers, and after January 1, 2025, for other entities meeting at least two of these criteria: total assets exceeding €25 million, net turnover exceeding €50 million, or an average of over 250 employees. Simplified rules will apply to other companies in the future. Exemptions apply to subsidiaries included in consolidated sustainability reports compliant with CSRD and ESRS, even if the parent company is outside the EU. Recent EU directives adjusting company size criteria may narrow the scope of CSRD reporting. The assessment of companies into specific size groups will first be applied for the accounting period ending December 31, 2023.</p>

      <h2>VAT NOVEL - Self-assessment for the import of goods within the country</h2>
      <p class="date">09.06.2024</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary62">The Slovak government has approved an amendment to the VAT Act, effective from 2025, transposing EU legislation on special arrangements for small businesses and administrative cooperation/information </p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full62" style="display:none;">The Slovak government has approved an amendment to the VAT Act, effective from 2025, transposing EU legislation on special arrangements for small businesses and administrative cooperation/information exchange. It also introduces changes regarding self-assessment for VAT on imports by Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs).<br><br>Under the amendment, VAT payers can self-assess import VAT if they are established in Slovakia or another EU member state, have a VAT ID, hold AEO status, and use the imported goods exclusively for domestic economic activities. If a foreign VAT payer uses indirect representation for imports via centralized customs clearance, the declarant must also have AEO status.<br><br>Eligible VAT payers must self-calculate import VAT and file a VAT return in the tax period when the tax liability arises, with the relevant tax office as the administrator. They can deduct the VAT according to general VAT deduction rules, resulting in a neutral financial impact. Failure to meet the conditions results in a penalty of 1.3% of the VAT amount that would have been levied by customs.<br><br>If the conditions for self-assessment are not met, standard customs procedures apply. The VAT payer must submit an import declaration electronically to the customs office, which will notify the VAT amount due. Payment is due within 10 days. Failure to submit the declaration triggers a 10-day warning; non-compliance leads to fines ranging from €1,000 to €10,000, depending on the delay. Foreign entities without activated electronic mailboxes must appoint a delivery representative with one.<br><br>These changes apply to imports where the tax liability arises from January 1, 2025. An AEO is certified for secure international trade based on internal controls, financial stability, and compliant customs procedures.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full63" style="display:none;">The Slovak government has approved amendments to the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act No. 222/2004 Z. z., effective gradually from 2024 to 2026. These changes stem from public finance consolidation measures, the Act No. 530/2023 Z. z. on the Transformation of Commercial Companies and Cooperatives, and the transposition of Council Directive (EU) 2020/285 regarding special arrangements for small businesses.<br><br>In 2024, the VAT rate on restaurant and catering services is clarified: the reduced 10% rate applies to non-alcoholic beverages, while alcoholic beverages exceeding 0.5% alcohol content are subject to the standard 20% rate. New rules regarding the transformation of commercial companies and cooperatives affect VAT payer status, requiring notification to the tax office within ten days of becoming a payer due to asset transfers. These rules also apply to foreign entities under certain conditions. Exceptions exist for transfers not considered supply of goods/services, such as the sale of a business. Selected payment service providers must provide records upon tax office request. Conditions for VAT reduction for registered social enterprises are simplified. Exemptions for services supplied to members are restricted to specific organizations.<br><br>From 2025, changes include a new VAT payer threshold of EUR 50,000 per calendar year, with exceptions for specific circumstances. Rules are specified for foreign entities and their permanent establishments. The application process and consequences of delayed registration are modified. New definitions related to small businesses are introduced, affecting VAT exemptions. These definitions cover annual turnover in Slovakia and the EU. Special rules apply to domestic and foreign small businesses. The definition of supply of goods during leasing and the place of supply for certain services are also amended. Documentary requirements for VAT deductions are relaxed and the limit for e-cash documents and tanking automats that can serve as invoices decreases to 400 EUR.<br><br>In 2026, self-assessment for goods imported after December 31, 2024, with tax liability after June 30, 2025, will be applicable to VAT payers established in Slovakia with an approved economic operator status. Starting January 1, 2026, self-assessment will extend to all VAT payers using centralized customs procedures with an approved economic operator status.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full64" style="display:none;">**Changes in Virtual Currency Taxation and Minimum Wage in Slovakia (2024)**<br><br>Effective January 1, 2024, Slovak tax law changes the treatment of virtual currencies. A virtual currency is defined as a digital store of value not issued or guaranteed by a central bank, not necessarily tied to legal tender, and accepted as a means of payment. The law also defines stablecoins and staking.<br><br>Crucially, exchanging one virtual currency for another is no longer considered a taxable sale; only exchanges for stablecoins trigger taxation. Profits from virtual currency sales within one year of acquisition or exchanges for stablecoins are taxed at 19% or 25%, depending on income level. Sales after one year are taxed at a special 7% rate. Income from mining or staking is taxed upon the sale of the acquired currency. A €2,400 exemption applies to income from exchanging virtual currency for goods or services.<br><br>The minimum monthly wage in Slovakia rises to €750 on January 1, 2024, impacting standard work hours. Consequently, minimum wage levels for different job complexity tiers increase, as do supplements for weekend, night, and holiday work. Weekend work supplement is €2.155, night work is €1.724, and work on Sundays is €4.31 per hour.<br><br>Meal allowance rates also increased, with a minimum meal voucher value of €5.85 and a maximum of €7.80. Employer contributions also see a rise.<br><br>Finally, a new law on corporate transformations, effective March 1, 2024, introduces new terminology for mergers and divisions. A key change is the introduction of "spin-offs," allowing partial asset transfers without dissolving the original company. Cross-border mergers and divisions are also addressed, with effectiveness determined by the relevant EU member state's laws.</p>

      <h2>Global Minimum Tax - the so-called TOP-UP TAX</h2>
      <p class="date">24.04.2024</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full65" style="display:none;">**Introduction**<br><br>The globally integrated economy necessitates addressing the taxation of multinational corporations earning income across various countries. International organizations are advocating for a unified approach to ensure equal treatment under tax laws across all nations. This involves establishing a collectively agreed-upon fair tax rate, irrespective of the multinational group involved, which participating countries would respect.<br><br>Slovakia has adopted this common approach by transposing Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523, which aims to guarantee a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups within the EU, into its tax legislation.<br><br>The directive utilizes OECD Model Rules and accompanying documents for its methodological framework, aiming to ensure companies pay a fair share of taxes, whether part of a domestic group within one country or a multinational group across several.<br><br>These rules involve determining fair taxation for multinational groups or large domestic enterprises, allowing participating countries to opt for either mandatory provisions, covering income inclusion and undertaxed profits, or voluntary provisions, incorporating a top-up tax into national law. These rules align with international reporting standards that require country-by-country reporting for cumulative revenues exceeding EUR 750 million. As Slovakia hosts mainly subsidiaries of international groups rather than domestic parent companies, it has implemented a voluntary provision transposing a global top-up tax.<br><br>Slovakia has enacted Law No. 507/2023 on the Top-Up Tax to ensure a minimum taxation level for entities within its territory belonging to multinational or large domestic groups. This law covers payment and collection of the top-up tax within Slovakia, affecting groups with consolidated revenues of at least EUR 750 million in at least two of the four accounting periods immediately preceding the analysed accounting period, plus joint ventures and entities affiliated with joint ventures.<br><br>The domestic top-up tax rate aligns with the global minimum taxation level of 15%.<br><br>Entities covered by the law must determine if their effective tax rate is at least 15%. The effective tax rate is calculated as the ratio of included taxes (including deferred tax, withholding tax, or special levies) to profit/loss in a jurisdiction, adjusted for specific items. If multiple entities from the same group are in Slovakia, the effective tax rate is calculated jointly for all. If the effective rate is below 15%, a top-up tax is calculated and paid.<br><br>A company whose effective tax rate falls below 15% must notify the relevant tax office electronically, providing information to determine the top-up tax by 15 months after the end of the tax period. This deadline is extended for transitional years. If the main parent entity in another country applies mandatory provisions and settles the top-up tax there, Slovak entities must notify the tax office of the country's details where taxation occurred.<br><br>If a Slovakia company is the main parent to a group, it is responsible for ensuring the global top-up tax is assessed and paid globally.<br><br>The entity tasked with taxation in Slovakia must file a tax return within 15 months of the designated tax period's end and pay the top-up tax. Tax returns are filed electronically.<br><br>Penalties range from EUR 1,500 to EUR 50,000 for non-compliance with notification requirements.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full67" style="display:none;">The amendment to the Income Tax Act from January 1, 2024, introduces several changes, including the reintroduction of a minimum corporate income tax similar to that in place until 2017. The withholding tax on dividends for individuals increases from 7% to 10% for profits earned from 2024 onwards. The amendment also specifies conditions for tax exemptions on shares and business shares received from employers or companies.<br><br>A minimum tax for legal entities is reintroduced, calculated based on taxable income, with rates ranging from €340 to €3,840 depending on income levels. Certain entities, such as newly established companies and non-profit organizations, are exempt. The amendment also increases the income threshold for applying a 15% income tax rate to €60,000 and raises the tax exemption limit for charitable advertising income to €30,000 for specific organizations.<br><br>Regarding VAT, the reduced 10% rate no longer applies to alcoholic beverages with more than 0.5% alcohol content, which will now be subject to the standard 20% rate. A special levy on businesses in regulated sectors is expanded to include other entities licensed by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS). A special levy on oil companies is extended to 2024.<br><br>The rate for old-age insurance increases for employers, self-employed individuals, and the self-paying. Amendments to the law on building savings remove preferential treatment for members of households. Contributions to the second pension pillar are reduced from 5.5% to 4%. Finally, the number of public holidays is reduced by removing September 1st, Constitution Day, as a public holiday.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full74" style="display:none;">**Summary:**<br><br>Slovakian law has removed Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) rules for individuals, effective August 1, 2023, due to concerns about proportionality and purpose. This change aims to discourage tax subjects from moving abroad. Simultaneously, the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic is reviewing the inclusion of contractual penalties and similar payments in the VAT base, emphasizing that amounts paid under contractual terms related to goods or services should be considered part of the taxable base, regardless of their designation. Interest on late payments and compensation for damaged goods are exceptions. Furthermore, the VAT treatment of financial contributions from landlords to tenants, such as "free rent" periods or "fit-out" contributions, requires careful assessment to determine if they constitute taxable supplies. Finally, a new law on the transformation of commercial companies and cooperatives, effective June 28, 2023, transposes EU Directive 2019/2121, introducing new terminology and procedures for cross-border conversions, mergers, divisions, and changes of legal form, aiming to streamline company mobility and enhance protection for stakeholders.</p>

The amendment introduces new employer obligations, strengthens whistleblower protection, and increases sanctions.<br><br>The internal investigation system involves internal processes and rules for receiving, investigating, and reporting the results of whistleblower reports. The amendment expands the scope of employers required to have such a system, including those providing services in transport, environment, and finance, regardless of employee count. It restricts delegating investigation duties to external entities, allowing it only for employers with fewer than 250 employees who are not public authorities.<br><br>The amendment broadens the definition of "whistleblower" to include those in "other similar relationships," extending protection to self-employed individuals, members of statutory and supervisory bodies, former employees, and prospective employees.<br><br>Sanctions for hindering whistleblowing, breaching confidentiality, or retaliating against whistleblowers can reach €6,000, doubling to €12,000 for repeat offenses.

      <h2>Key Legislative Changes Effective from 2023</h2>
      <p class="date">24.02.2023</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary78">**Income Tax Act**<br><br>The Income Tax Act (§ 33) allows taxpayers with taxable income under § 5 or § 6, sections 1 and 2 to claim a tax bonus for each dependent child living in their household. As of Jan</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full78" style="display:none;">**Income Tax Act**<br><br>The Income Tax Act (§ 33) allows taxpayers with taxable income under § 5 or § 6, sections 1 and 2 to claim a tax bonus for each dependent child living in their household. As of January 1, 2023, the bonus increases to €50 monthly for children over 15 and €100 monthly for children under 15, except when the child receives a subsidy for meal support.<br><br>A temporary change increases the bonus to €50 for dependents over 18 and €140 for those under 18, valid from January 2023 to December 2024, excluding cases with meal support subsidies. The bonus is capped based on a percentage of the income tax base: 20% for one child, up to 55% for six or more.<br><br>The Act introduces a "safe harbor" for transfer pricing by defining a significant controlled transaction as one exceeding €10,000, reducing administrative burden. The financial administration will use the median of independent comparable values. Related party definitions are also updated, including close relatives. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines are incorporated into Slovak law. Bilateral and multilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) can be issued for over five tax periods if agreed. Taxpayers can submit transfer pricing documentation in any foreign language, with a 15-day Slovak translation upon request. Rules for determining the tax base of a permanent establishment of a Slovak non-resident are revised to align with OECD standards. The act also includes changes related to interest expense limitations, preventative restructuring, insurance pricing, registration adjustments, and the taxation of corporate bond yields.<br><br>**VAT Act**<br><br>The VAT Act (§ 53b) requires customers (debtors) to correct deducted VAT if they haven't paid for goods or services 100 days after the due date. Debtors can re-deduct the corrected VAT upon payment. This applies only to cases where the supplier pays the tax (§ 69, section 1), not reverse charge situations. The Act introduces a presumption for the latest possible delivery date of correction documents.<br><br>For irrecoverable debts (§25a), a debt is deemed irrecoverable if unpaid 150 days after the due date, meeting conditions based on value (above or below €1,000 including VAT). Rules regarding low-value debts (under €300) are removed.<br><br>The Act removes mandatory VAT registration for entities with a turnover of €49,790 solely from exempt activities (§ 37-39). These entities can request deregistration. A reduced VAT rate of 10% applies from January 1 to March 31, 2023, to certain gastronomy, sports services, and passenger transport via cable cars and ski lifts.<br><br>**Accounting Act**<br><br>The Accounting Act (§ 21) requires final parent companies with consolidated revenues exceeding €750 million in each of the two previous accounting periods to prepare a report with income tax information. A standalone accounting unit should do the same if its revenues exceeded €750,000,000. These reports must be filed in the commercial registry, excluding entities exclusively tax resident in Slovakia or those publishing annual reports according to the Banking Act. Auditors must include information regarding the income tax report according to (§ 21a or § 21b) in the auditor's report. Also, the auditor´s report is required for legal entities which has received over 35.000 eur of tax payment shares.<br><br>**Act on International Assistance and Cooperation in Tax Administration**<br><br>DAC7 mandates digital platforms like Airbnb and Uber to report customer information to the financial administration, starting in January 2023, without being prompted. Reporting occurs annually, with the first report due by January 31, 2024, for the 2023 period.<br><br>**Commercial Code**<br><br>Amendments to the Commercial Code alter the effective date of transferring a majority share in a company, eliminating legal distinctions between majority and minority share transfers. The registry entry now confirms an existing legal state. The requirement to provide tax administrator consent for transferring majority shares if either transferor or transferee appears on the tax debtor list is removed.<br><br>**Minimum Wage Act**<br><br>The minimum wage, effective January 1, 2023, is set at €700 per month or €4.023 per hour.<br><br>**Travel Expense Act**<br><br>As of January 1, 2023, meal allowance rates for business trips increase to €6.80 (5-12 hours), €10.10 (12-18 hours), and €15.30 (over 18 hours). The minimum value of meal vouchers is €5.10.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full79" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic announced a new call for energy subsidies on February 21, 2023, to mitigate the impact of increased gas and electricity prices. Eligible recipients include any business or entity engaged in economic activity, regardless of legal status, funding, or size, where economic activity is defined as offering goods and services on the market. The subsidy application period covers January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023.<br><br>Eligible costs for determining the subsidy amount are calculated by multiplying the amount of natural gas and/or electricity (in MWh) consumed by the applicant during the eligible period by the increase in price paid per unit (EUR/MWh). However, natural gas and/or electricity used for electricity and heat production are not eligible.<br><br>The subsidy calculation formulas are: Electricity Subsidy = Consumption in MWh x (Average price per MWh in EUR – 199) x 0.8; Gas Subsidy = Consumption in MWh x (Average price per MWh in EUR – 99) x 0.8.<br><br>Subsidies can cover up to 80% of eligible costs, with a maximum of EUR 200,000 per month per enterprise, not per individual company ID. Applicants must disclose all entities forming part of the same economic unit.<br><br>Applications must be submitted electronically via a form on the Central Government Portal. Gas and electricity consumption can be found using the POD or EIC code on the invoices. The application deadline is June 30, 2023, and the allocated budget is EUR 279,820,623. The Ministry may amend the call until its closure.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full80" style="display:none;">The recent amendment to the Income Tax Act in Slovakia introduces several significant changes to transfer pricing, effective from January 1, 2023. Accompanying this is an updated Guideline from the Ministry of Finance, defining the content and scope of transfer pricing documentation.<br><br>Key changes include a new definition of a "significant controlled transaction," set at €10,000, aiming to reduce administrative burden for low-value transactions. The tax authorities will use the median of independent comparable values if pricing is inconsistent with the arm's length principle, although taxpayers can argue for adjustments within the independent range. The definition of related parties is expanded to include close relatives and their shareholdings, aggregating to at least 25%.<br><br>The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines are now formally incorporated into Slovak law, bolstering legal certainty. Bilateral and multilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) can now extend beyond five tax periods, subject to agreement between treaty states. Taxpayers can submit transfer pricing documentation in any foreign language, with tax authorities retaining the right to request Slovak translations within 15 days.<br><br>The amendment also adjusts the determination of taxable income for permanent establishments of non-residents in Slovakia, aligning with OECD principles, particularly regarding expenses demonstrably incurred. Foreign taxpayers can assess the tax base as the difference between income and expenses attributable to the permanent establishment, not solely on a cash basis.<br><br>The updated Guideline incorporates the concept of "significant controlled transactions," reducing the number of taxpayers required to prepare transfer pricing documentation, especially in simplified form. Documentation is not required for insignificant transactions (under €10,000) if the taxpayer doesn't report a tax loss, doesn't apply a tax loss deduction, or applies a 15% tax rate. Full tax return filings suffice for documentation in these cases. Increased documentation requirements persist for those claiming tax relief, transacting with related parties in non-cooperative states, or seeking APAs. The guideline is applicable for tax periods starting after December 31, 2022.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full81" style="display:none;">According to the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic, the amendment aims to "strengthen and support a favorable environment for the development of social entrepreneurship." It also introduces a definition of family businesses, emphasizing the preservation of family ties, values, and traditions.<br><br>The amendment to the Act on Social Economy and Social Enterprises introduces the first legislative definition of a family business in Slovakia: a business company, cooperative, or natural person – entrepreneur, provided it meets specific legal conditions, particularly the existence of ties between several family members and the business.<br><br>The law specifies three types of family businesses: Registered Family Business, Recorded Family Business and Family Farm.<br><br>A Recorded Family Business is entitled to use the designation "family business" or the abbreviation "r. p." in writing and can apply to have the designation "family business" entered in the Commercial Register.<br><br>A Registered Family Business is obliged to use at least 12% of its profit after tax to strengthen its internal and external relations within one year from the date of approval of the financial statements showing a positive result for the accounting period, primarily for education, pension provision, recreation, healthcare, and social assistance for family members and employees. They are required to use the designation "registered family business" or the abbreviation "r. r. p." in writing, also to register the designation “registered family business” into the Commercial Register. Failure to fulfill these obligations may result in fines.<br><br>While the effort to define family business concepts is positive, the amended law lacks specific forms of support for family businesses, attempting to align them with social enterprises. While preserving family ties is important, family businesses are primarily about profit. The amendment is perceived as more "family" than "business." Family businesses need assistance in succession planning, inheritance law reform, tax benefits, preferential employment conditions for family members, and easier access to financing. Defining family businesses in other laws, such as those concerning income tax and commercial and civil codes, is considered more important.</p>

We are pleased to have contributed to the happiness and joy of those who need it most. Articles about the event are available online.<br><br>In summary, the "Osmidiv" benefit event, now in its 13th year, provided a day of entertainment and learning for mentally disabled children from various institutions. The event, held in Banská Štiavnica, featured musical performances, hosted by Roman Pomajbo, and interactive workshops teaching skills like dancing, painting, dowsing and crafts.

      <p class="full-content" id="full85" style="display:none;">Who were the top taxpayers of 2021? How much tax did they pay to the state? How do companies perceive the tax and levy burden in Slovakia? According to Martin Kiňo, a partner, speaking to Trend.sk, most companies propose reducing corporate income tax by at least 2 percent to 19 percent, similar to the Czech Republic, and decreasing the levy burden by 5 to 10 percent. More information can be found in Zuzana Kullová's article on Trend.sk. The article discusses Matovič's plans for higher taxes and smaller profits, aiming for more money for the state, contrasting it with the desires of the top taxpayers of the year.<br><br>The article on Trend.sk explores the top taxpayers of 2021 in Slovakia, examining their financial contributions and perspectives on the country's tax and levy system. Companies are advocating for tax reductions, specifically lowering the corporate income tax to 19% to align with rates in the Czech Republic, and a 5-10% decrease in the levy burden. The discussion stems from Matovič's proposed tax increases aimed at boosting state revenue, a policy in direct contrast with the wishes of the leading taxpayers. The article, authored by Zuzana Kullová, delves into the potential implications of these conflicting viewpoints on the Slovakian economy.</p>

      <h2>DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS UNDER DAC 7</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full87" style="display:none;">As of January 2023, a new amendment to Act No. 442/2012, implementing DAC 7, requires digital platforms to report information about their users to the Slovakian Financial Administration without being prompted. This targets income earned through these platforms, ensuring proper tax compliance. Digital platforms are defined as any software or electronic interface connecting sellers and buyers, including those facilitating sales, rentals, or service provisions.<br><br>The reporting requirements apply to both platform operators established and not established in Slovakia, with specific criteria defining each. Operators must report data, including identifying information and details on sellers' activities, such as income and financial account identifiers. The first reporting period is the 2023 calendar year, with information due by January 31, 2024. Exceptions exist for operators who have already reported information through another platform. Operators must also notify authorities of their chosen reporting member state and register if not established in any member state.<br><br>The law outlines verification procedures for collecting information on sellers and imposes penalties for non-compliance. Fines range from €3,000 for failing to report, €5,000 for failing to register, and up to €10,000 for non-compliance with information reporting and verification procedures. Repeated offenses after warnings can result in further penalties. Platform operators must assess their obligations and prepare for compliance to avoid sanctions, potentially implementing processes in advance.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full88" style="display:none;">The amendment to Act No. 111/2022 on managing imminent bankruptcy, effective from July 17, 2022, introduces changes to the Commercial Code regarding the transfer of business shares.<br><br>Previously, the effective date of a majority business share transfer was the date of registration in the Commercial Register. The amendment removes the distinction between majority and minority shares, making the effective date the date the company receives the transfer agreement, unless the agreement specifies a later date, but not before shareholder approval if required. Registration now serves as a confirmation of an existing legal status, simplifying the transfer process, reducing administrative burden for businesses and the registry court, and increasing legal certainty.<br><br>Furthermore, the requirement to obtain tax administrator consent for transferring majority shares when the transferor or transferee is on the list of tax debtors has been eliminated. This obligation to verify tax arrears and submit consent or an affidavit for foreign entities is no longer necessary for transfers after July 17, 2022.<br><br>However, the obligation to submit tax administrator consent or an affidavit remains when establishing a limited liability company if the founder is on the list of tax debtors. The change only affects business share transfers.</p>

This may also impact your transfer pricing.<br><br>Companies experienced fluctuations in revenues and cash flows during the pandemic and faced forced closures. Conversely, some segments and companies significantly strengthened. Many countries intervened and provided subsidies to domestic firms to protect local economies and maintain jobs. Independent companies and businesses in the market responded to the new economic conditions in various ways. Companies re-evaluated their existing business strategies and contractual arrangements with third parties. Economic entities faced and continue to face new types of risks.<br><br>All these changes also affect the comparison of prices and profitability of transactions with related parties. The OECD has therefore issued guidance on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on transfer pricing, addressing, for example, the comparability of data for comparability analysis purposes, as well as the potential impact of government support programs on transfer prices.<br><br>The issue of transfer pricing is becoming even more complex, so the correct application of the guidance can be crucial for companies. Some practical conclusions can be drawn from them, likely applicable to your company as well.<br><br>If the industry in which you operate was affected by the pandemic, it may require an update of the comparability analysis or quantification of the impact of the pandemic.<br><br>If you have received a state subsidy, taxpayers should conduct an analysis to determine the impact of state aid programs on their operations and their market and adjust their transfer pricing accordingly.<br><br>If your group or company faced significant losses and new risks, then it is necessary to update the functional and risk profile and consider the allocation of losses or specific costs within the group of companies.<br><br>The Financial Administration is paying more attention to transfer prices during tax audits.<br><br>The Financial Administration pointed out that the Office for Selected Economic Entities (ÚVHS) will ask 889 taxpayers to voluntarily complete a simple questionnaire focused on transactions they carried out with related parties for the tax period of the calendar year 2020, or for a tax period other than the calendar year ending in 2020. The Financial Administration expects that the analysis of the data will allow it to more effectively combat tax evasion and possible tax fraud. The data obtained will also be used to assess the need for legislative and non-legislative changes in the area of transfer pricing and their possible impacts.<br><br>ÚVHS is one of the institutions of the Financial Administration, which was established in 2019 by transforming the Tax Office for Selected Tax Subjects. Its remit includes: banks or branches of foreign banks, insurance and reinsurance companies and branches of foreign insurance and reinsurance companies, securities dealers, pension management companies or supplementary pension companies, payment institutions, entities with the status of approved economic entity, taxpayers who have achieved an annual turnover of EUR 40 million or more for each of two consecutive tax periods.<br><br>This growing trend can also be observed based on statistical data on tax audits from the Financial Administration Open Data portal.

Updating functional and risk profiles and considering loss allocation within groups is essential, especially when facing significant losses or new risks. Slovakian Financial Administration increases scrutiny on transfer pricing, focusing on potential tax evasion. They are surveying taxpayers regarding transactions with related parties.

      <p class="full-content" id="full90" style="display:none;">Employing family members is a key aspect of generational transitions in family businesses, often influenced by emotions. While having relatives on the payroll can be beneficial with a well-defined system and strong family relationships, it can also be a burden. It's crucial to differentiate between family and work relationships, as they operate on different principles. Treating a family member's misconduct differently than an employee's is essential.<br><br>Founders must avoid letting familial devotion overshadow rational business decisions, such as prematurely granting high positions to inexperienced relatives. For the business's sake, founders must detach from family ties while remaining open to changes brought by the new generation.<br><br>Recent legislative changes offer some flexibility in employing relatives. From a tax perspective, the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic issued guidelines stipulating that dependent activity is not generally considered a controlled transaction, regardless of whether it is performed by an employee, partner, or executive.<br><br>Also, relatives assisting in a family business without an employment contract may not pose a problem. Since 2020, relatives of the sole shareholder of a limited liability company are not considered illegal workers if they are pension insured, pensioners, or students under 26. As of 2023, this exception extends to limited liability companies with two shareholders if they are direct relatives, siblings, or spouses.</p>

A new section, § 17k, addresses this.<br><br>Until 2023, Slovakia had an exception, limiting interest expense restrictions under § 21a to related parties only. The new § 17k applies to all interest expenses, including bank interest. If net interest expenses exceed €3,000,000, the tax base increases by the amount exceeding 30% of the tax base plus net interest expenses and depreciation (EBITDA). Net interest expenses are the difference between deductible interest expenses and taxable interest income.<br><br>Unlike § 21a, capitalized interest is included. § 21a clarifies that it doesn't apply to capitalized interest.

It´s applicable only above 3,000,000 EUR. § 17k allows to apply unused interest costs in next 5 tax periods.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full92" style="display:none;">The amendment to the Income Tax Act addresses preventive restructuring as per Act No. 111/2022, enabling debtors facing insolvency to proactively implement restructuring measures. This involves creating a plan that may include debt forgiveness. The amendment allows creditors to recognize the forgiven debt as a tax-deductible expense when a preventive restructuring plan is court-approved, provided general conditions are met. Debtors will proceed with standard debt write-off procedures.<br><br>Furthermore, the amendment allows for the inclusion of provisions for receivables from debtors in preventive restructuring proceedings as tax-deductible expenses, similar to standard restructuring. Full provision can be made up to the receivable's nominal value if it was included in taxable income.<br><br>The amendment also adapts to new international accounting standards for the insurance industry, specifically IFRS 17, which replaces IFRS 4. IFRS 17 changes how insurance contract liabilities are reported. Instead of technical reserves, insurers will report liabilities based on discounted cash flow. These costs will be tax-deductible in accordance with accounting practices. Adjustments to the tax base resulting from implementing IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 will be included in the tax base evenly, starting no earlier than January 1, 2023.<br><br>Finally, the amendment adjusts the tax bonus for dependent children following the July 1, 2022 change, allowing for a higher deduction by factoring in the income of both eligible individuals. This aggregation of income will first be applicable for the 2023 tax year. The law also modifies the income tax registration process for specific taxpayer types. Taxpayers will be registered ex officio based on data from public registers and a notice published by the Financial Directorate, starting January 1, 2023.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full93" style="display:none;">The generational transfer in a family business is a lengthy process of handing over capital to successors. As the family grows, managing the business becomes more complex, shifting from individual leadership by the founder to collective management through a general meeting. This necessitates higher management standards that increase with each generation.<br><br>Family businesses face the choice of involving family members in management or limiting their roles to ownership, delegating management to external individuals. When employing family members, it's crucial that they meet the same standards as other employees without undue favoritism, to avoid disadvantages and maintain employee morale. Early consideration of the founder's descendants' education in the context of the business is advisable, although not mandatory, as strong family relationships are vital.<br><br>When appointing external individuals to key positions, the family should maintain independence. While fostering a family-like atmosphere for all employees is beneficial, external hires require similar oversight as in non-family businesses. These employees can still prioritize the family firm's interests if properly motivated. External managers must understand the unique dynamics of family businesses, which often operate differently than conventional companies, and adapt creatively to their specific characteristics.<br><br>Whether family members participate actively or remain in the background, hiring an external, impartial advisor is recommended. This advisor can provide unbiased opinions in conflicts between family members or between family and key external employees.</p>

Several amendments to the definition of related parties, transfer pricing rules, and the assessment of permanent establishments are introduced, effective from January 1, 2023.<br><br>The definition of related parties is expanded to include cases where close relatives' shares are combined to reach a 25% threshold for economic interconnection. The definition of economic connection is reformulated, specifically addressing relationships between permanent establishments and their founders. The definition of a controlled transaction is adjusted, excluding dependent activities where income falls under § 5 of the Income Tax Act, regardless of whether it's performed by an employee of a related party or a company executive.<br><br>Foreign taxpayers operating in Slovakia through a permanent establishment can now determine the tax base based on the difference between revenues and expenses attributable to the permanent establishment, as determined from the foreign taxpayer's accounting records. The definition of a significant controlled transaction is refined, excluding legal relationships where neither related party achieves taxable income or tax expense exceeding €10,000 (except for loans exceeding €10,000). The law grants the right to a corresponding adjustment of the tax base when a primary adjustment is made in a Slovak legal entity and the counterparty is a Slovak permanent establishment of a non-resident. The determination of the tax base for permanent establishments is aligned with OECD guidelines. The law also adds a reference to OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and clarifies the tax administrator's procedures when prices used in transactions with related parties don't adhere to the arm's length principle. Finally, the documentation can first be submitted in a foreign language, before translating to state language, based on tax authorities decision.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full95" style="display:none;">Consolidating family assets is crucial for tax optimization and protecting wealth across generations. Selling a business as an individual can incur up to 25% tax plus health insurance contributions, while selling through a legal entity can potentially result in zero taxation under specific conditions. Although gift and inheritance taxes are currently absent, donation contracts and wills cannot impose conditions on recipients.<br><br>Consider a founder whose children inherit equal shares of the company. If the son wants to sell his share and the daughter wishes to continue the business, the son can sell to a foreign investor if the daughter lacks funds to buy him out. Eventually, the daughter might also sell due to disagreements, leading to the demise of the family business and inefficient taxation.<br><br>Family holdings, typically structured as limited liability or joint-stock companies, are the most recognized method for asset consolidation. These companies hold and manage assets and equity in subsidiary companies. Limited liability companies offer the advantage of restricting share transfers and inheritance, alongside lower operating costs. Joint-stock companies allow for unlimited shareholders, shareholder anonymity, and limited liability. For large estates, trusts or private foundations in the Czech Republic can further safeguard assets by separating ownership from the family, reducing risks associated with tax increases or the introduction of wealth taxes. These structures maintain assets as a whole and allow for stipulated rules for their use.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full97" style="display:none;">From July 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, changes were implemented in calculating the child tax bonus in Slovakia. Previously, the bonus varied based on the child's age (e.g., €47.14 for children under 6), but from July 1, 2022, it became €70 for children under 15 and €40 for those aged 15-25. During this transitional period, the calculation used whichever method (old or new) was more beneficial for the taxpayer.<br><br>Full entitlement to the tax bonus (either €70 or €40) depends on meeting a specific income threshold, calculated as a percentage of the taxpayer's tax base, depending on the number of dependent children.<br><br>Further changes are planned for January 1, 2023, increasing the bonus to €100 for children under 15 and €50 for those aged 15-25. The comparison with the old calculation method will be abolished.<br><br>A draft amendment to the Income Tax Act aims to address situations where taxpayers have too low an income to claim the bonus. They may be allowed to file a tax return (even employees normally eligible for annual settlement) and include the income of another eligible person who jointly supports the child in the household to calculate the bonus. However, these proposed changes are subject to revision.</p>

This was stated in a press release by the audit and advisory company Moore BDR. The amount of the finding during inspections in companies has increased by more than half on average. The probability of finding a violation of tax legislation, along with penalties, is growing at a record pace. "When we compare the current three-year period 2018, 2019 and 2020 with the period from 10 years ago, the number of tax audits decreased by approximately 40%, but the amount of findings from tax audits increased by almost 60% over the same period," the company warned. This is a statistic based on data from the Financial Administration.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The number of tax audits has significantly decreased in recent years, with a 40% drop compared to a decade ago. However, the efficiency of the financial administration has improved, leading to a notable increase in the average amount found during company audits. Specifically, the amount of detected violations and associated penalties has risen by approximately 60% over the same period. These statistics, derived from the Financial Administration's data, indicate a higher probability of businesses being found in violation of tax laws, despite the reduced number of audits. This trend underscores the increased effectiveness of current audit processes.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full103" style="display:none;">The period leading up to the end of March is the annual tax optimization season for companies. Despite many Slovak entrepreneurs being dissatisfied with the current state of legal tax optimization, experts say many don't fully utilize all the latest legal provisions.<br><br>New amendments could significantly help reduce their tax burden, especially through activities in innovation, science, and research. According to Martin Kiňo from Moore BDR, the aim is to support high value-added production in Slovak companies. He highlights tax incentives for R&D firms, including a "super deduction" for R&D costs, a "patent box" regime that exempts income from patents, utility models, and software developed in-house, and temporary support for productive investments tied to Industry 4.0.<br><br>Companies can save up to 50% on taxes using the patent box regime, effectively taxing relevant income at 10.5%. Those using the super deduction and continuing R&D can potentially achieve an effective tax rate of 0%. To leverage tax benefits for R&D, companies must understand relevant regulations and have documentation proving they meet all conditions. Determining if an activity qualifies as R&D can be complex.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full104" style="display:none;">Most entrepreneurs are not fully utilizing recent amendments to the Income Tax Act, particularly in innovation, science, and research. These amendments offer significant tax relief to companies engaged in these activities.<br><br>Key tax optimization tools include:<br><br>1.  **Patent Box:** A tax regime for legal entities allowing a 50% tax exemption on income from licensing fees for patents, utility models, and software resulting from the company's R&D in Slovakia. A similar exemption applies to 50% of income from product sales utilizing patents or utility models developed by the taxpayer in Slovakia.<br><br>2.  **Super Deduction for R&D Expenses:** Allows companies and the self-employed to deduct R&D expenses from their tax base, in addition to the initial deduction. From 2015 up to 2021, the deduction was 200% of the R&D expenses. In 2022, however, the percentage decreased to 100%.<br><br>3.  **Investment Deduction:** A temporary incentive allowing additional deduction of investment expenses from tax depreciation, ranging from 15% to 55%, depending on the investment amount and targeting productive investments tied to Industry 4.0. This applies to investments in manufacturing and logistics systems (tangible and intangible assets), requiring a minimum investment of €1 million exceeding seven times the average investment over the past three years (2019-2021) and an investment plan covering the period of 2022 to 2025. It applies to legal entities and self-employed persons operating for more than three years.<br><br>Expertise in preparing documentation and adherence to legal requirements are essential when applying these regimes.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full105" style="display:none;">The main challenge for family businesses, especially those established after the Velvet Revolution, is succession. While the younger generation brings fresh perspectives, their entry also presents challenges.<br><br>The solution lies in consolidating the family business's assets. This requires understanding the business's overall situation, including risks, opportunities, structure, liquidity, and financial indicators like cash flow and return on investment. Consolidation ensures a clearly defined structure that maximizes asset efficiency, benefiting relationships with creditors and facilitating intergenerational transfer and inheritance. This consolidation should ideally be done by the original founder who intuitively understands the business and can provide guidance for future generations.<br><br>Proper asset consolidation reduces risks associated with the founder's established influence, which successors need to build anew. A well-consolidated estate provides a solid foundation for them, allowing them to navigate and utilize assets effectively. It also simplifies property rights, reducing potential conflicts arising from multiple heirs. Without consolidation, the "family tree" of ownership relationships can become increasingly complex, hindering decision-making and efficiency across generations.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full106" style="display:none;">The generational handover in a family business, involving the company's entire assets, is a challenging process often made more difficult by the founder's initial focus on immediate opportunities rather than long-term succession planning. The inclusion of subsequent generations introduces diverse perspectives, potentially jeopardizing the business if not handled carefully. This transition is a critical, often irreversible operation where inadequate preparation can lead to failure and the gradual erosion of the family's wealth.<br><br>The key solution lies in family asset consolidation, aimed at preventing the fragmentation of strategic assets among future generations while ensuring adequate support for close family members. Assets should remain firmly within the immediate family, avoiding dispersal among different branches, former partners, or individuals outside the core family. Asset consolidation is paramount in safeguarding the family business during generational shifts.</p>

These measures aim to counter aggressive tax avoidance but also impact legitimate holding structures. An article by Martin Kiňo in Trend weekly explores current tax trends affecting holding structures. The globalized economy enables companies to exploit tax loopholes through strategies like headquarters relocation, leading to initiatives like BEPS and EU's ATAD directives. While targeting aggressive tax schemes, these regulations also affect compliant holding companies. The article featured discusses these trends and their implications.

      <h2>Transparent Entities after 1.1.2022 (General Commercial Partnerships and Limited Partnerships)</h2>
      <p class="date">16.02.2022</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full108" style="display:none;">The article discusses new Slovak tax regulations concerning transparent entities like general partnerships and limited partnerships controlled by foreign individuals, effective January 1, 2022. These regulations implement ATAD 2, introducing rules for reverse hybrid entities to tax income allocated to foreign partners if it isn't taxed elsewhere. A "transparent entity" is defined as a partnership where income is taxed at the partner level. A "reverse hybrid entity" is considered transparent in its country of origin but non-transparent by its foreign owner's country, creating a risk of double non-taxation. If foreign partners own 50% or more of a transparent entity, their income will be taxed at the corporate income tax rate of 21% in Slovakia if not taxable elsewhere. A new reporting requirement mandates foreign partners meeting the 50% threshold to declare the company's hybrid status. This applies retroactively to existing entities, requiring notification by January 31, 2022. While the rules primarily target foreign partners, limited partners should still verify the ultimate beneficiary for profit distributions to avoid potential withholding taxes, which can be as high as 35% if the beneficiary is not proven. This is particularly relevant due to ongoing discussions regarding the definition of the "ultimate beneficiary". The complexities necessitate consultation with tax advisors when using transparent entities.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full111" style="display:none;">Tax audits are generally unpleasant for businesses, representing a significant government intervention. However, financial administration statistics show increasing efficiency in tax audits. Compared to a decade ago, the number of tax audits has halved, while the detected discrepancies and resulting fines have increased, indicating more effective audits but greater challenges for taxpayers. VAT remains the primary focus, but tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing other taxes, such as corporate and individual income tax.<br><br>Data from 2018-2020 reveals a higher probability of findings during audits. Taxpayers lacking proper documentation and professional representation are at a disadvantage. The dynamic nature of tax, accounting, and auditing legislation makes it nearly impossible for businesses to manage these areas alongside their core activities. Statistics highlight a high percentage of audits related to employment income tax also resulting in findings. Transfer pricing audits in 2020 resulted in findings in 83% of cases.<br><br>Preparing for a tax audit successfully relies on the quality, quantity, and professional processing of supporting documents. Therefore, seeking representation from experts can save time, stress, and money by avoiding hefty penalties. Moore BDR offers 30 years of experience in tax and economic consulting, auditing, accounting, and payroll services, with a specialized team for every tax area.</p>

Approved by the National Council of the Slovak Republic on October 27, 2021, the amendment affects not only the Tax Code but also the Income Tax Act and the VAT Act.<br><br>Effective November 15, 2021, taxpayers must report all business-related bank accounts to the Financial Directorate, which will publish a list on its website. Failure to report or paying to unlisted accounts results in VAT liability for the customer.<br><br>From January 1, 2022, the tax reliability index is modified to enhance motivation. The index, assigned to all income tax-registered entities, will be evaluated every half-year based on criteria set by the Ministry of Finance. Highly reliable entities receive benefits like extended deadlines for tax audits and reduced fees for binding opinions. Conversely, unreliable entities face shorter deadlines.<br><br>Additional changes from January 1, 2022, include publishing taxpayer bank accounts and tax reliability indices on the Financial Administration's website. The deduction for research and development is reduced to 100% of eligible expenses. Furthermore, taxpayers can claim an additional deduction (15% to 55%) for investment expenses, depending on the level of reinvestment, with specific conditions to be met, including a minimum investment of EUR 1 million and an investment plan.<br><br>Administrative burdens are reduced by eliminating physical DIČ/IČ-DPH cards, while the fee for binding opinions is lowered. A new measure allows authorities to exclude individuals from acting as statutory representatives of companies to combat VAT fraud. Other changes include the abolition of summary protocols, easier access to files, and the possibility of conducting witness hearings via videoconference.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full113" style="display:none;">The amendment aims to combat tax fraud, improve the business environment, and transpose EU law into the VAT Act. Key changes include new reporting obligations for VAT payers, specifically concerning bank accounts used for business, which must be reported to the Financial Directorate. These accounts will be publicly accessible to minimize the risk of liability for unpaid VAT. Existing VAT payers had to report their accounts by November 30, 2021, while newly registered payers must do so immediately. Failure to comply results in fines and delays in VAT refunds.<br><br>The amendment also expands liability for unpaid VAT, creating a presumption that customers knew or should have known if a supplier would not pay VAT, especially if payment was made to an unreported bank account. To avoid liability, customers can verify the supplier's bank account against the Financial Directorate's list or use "split payment," where the VAT portion of the invoice is paid directly to the tax authority. Registration cards are eliminated from January 1, 2022, and OSS scheme rules clarified. Finally, deposits on beverage containers are excluded from the taxable base.</p>

In such cases, the VAT payer must also identify the actual account owner, who will be jointly liable for unpaid VAT on invoices paid into that account.<br><br>From January 1, 2022, customers paying suppliers into unreported accounts may be liable for the supplier's unpaid VAT. Furthermore, VAT refunds will only be paid into reported accounts, with delays if accounts are not registered. Failure to comply may result in fines ranging from €30 to €3,000, and providing incorrect information can incur penalties up to €10,000.<br><br>VAT payers must promptly report any changes to their registered bank accounts. If the sender of the email handles electronic communication with the tax authorities on behalf of a client, they request the client to provide all relevant bank account details for reporting. Otherwise, taxpayers can find pre-filled forms on the Financial Administration portal or seek assistance.</p>

She also presented the concept of a Family Constitution. A unique publication on succession planning, "Generational Exchange Step by Step," was also introduced. Ján Oravec, State Secretary of the Ministry of Economy, announced the upcoming definition of a family firm in Slovakia. Digital marketing consultant Paolo Ramazzotti advised on social media strategies for family businesses. Gabriela Končitíková shared the Bata company's succession secret: every key manager had a replaceable counterpart.

      <h2>Audit in a new way - criteria for 2021 and 2022</h2>

      <p class="summary" id="summary122">Are you unsure if you need an audit for 2021 and 2022? The Slovak National Council approved Law No. 198/2020, amending the requirements for auditing individual financial statements. Effective January </p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full122" style="display:none;">Are you unsure if you need an audit for 2021 and 2022? The Slovak National Council approved Law No. 198/2020, amending the requirements for auditing individual financial statements. Effective January 1, 2021, and January 1, 2022, the size criteria for mandatory audits were adjusted.<br><br>For 2021, an audit is required if a company exceeds two of the following criteria: total assets over €3,000,000, net turnover over €6,000,000, or an average of more than 40 employees. For 2022, the thresholds increase to €4,000,000 in assets, €8,000,000 in turnover, and 50 employees. These criteria are assessed based on the accounting period in which the period began and the previous period.<br><br>Even without a legal obligation, a voluntary audit can benefit a company by enhancing financial reliability and trust with stakeholders, identifying risks, improving internal controls, and providing assurance to management. It also helps verify tax accuracy, offers insights from auditors' industry experience, and can be beneficial when seeking loans. An example illustrates how these criteria apply to a company with a non-calendar fiscal year, demonstrating the assessment process for audit obligations. The article encourages readers to seek their services for mandatory or voluntary audits.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full123" style="display:none;">On May 28, 2021, a bill supporting state-subsidized rental housing and amending related laws was submitted to the National Council of the Slovak Republic. The bill aims to address the issue of housing affordability and accessibility for a broad range of the population.<br><br>A key element is the introduction of a state-supported rental housing allowance, capped at €4 per square meter of floor space and a maximum of €360 per month, to be provided by employers. Employees can only claim this allowance from one employer per month. The allowance is proposed to be tax-exempt and considered a tax-deductible expense for employers.<br><br>The bill also proposes reducing the depreciation period for buildings used for state-subsidized rental housing from 40 to 20 years. It suggests income from the sale of mutual fund shares held for over 36 months to be tax-free. Additionally, a reduced VAT rate of 5% is proposed for the supply of buildings (including land and parking spaces), renovations, and reconstructions intended for state-subsidized rental housing, provided the recipient is a state-supported rental housing landlord with a building operation agreement.<br><br>The bill also aims to remove restrictions on the option to choose taxation for the supply of buildings intended for state-supported rental housing, allowing VAT payers to opt for taxation on previously tax-exempt properties.<br><br>The bill will undergo interdepartmental review, with a deadline for discussion in committees set for mid-September 2021.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full124" style="display:none;">Slovakia implemented "Kurzarbeit" (short-time work) from January 1, 2022, through a law supporting reduced working hours. This aims to aid both employers and employees during crises when employers cannot assign work due to external factors. Employers who pay insurance for this scheme are eligible. This insurance is part of the unemployment insurance, with the employer's 1% contribution split into 0.5% for short-time work support and 0.5% for unemployment insurance.<br><br>If external factors like emergencies, states of exception, or force majeure prevent employers from providing work, they can apply for "Kurzarbeit" support from the Social Insurance Agency via the Labor, Social Affairs and Family Office. This support is then used to pay employee wage compensation. External factors exclude war, seasonality, restructuring, or planned shutdowns.<br><br>Eligible employers are both individuals and legal entities under specific Social Insurance Act provisions. Eligible employees are those in employment or civil service, or under contract for professional sports. A key condition is that at least one-third of employees cannot be assigned work for at least 10% of their weekly hours. Employers must have paid social insurance and pension contributions for 24 months, not have violated illegal employment bans, and have a written agreement with employee representatives (or employees) or an arbitrator's approval to apply for support.<br><br>The support covers 60% of the average hourly earnings for each hour of work obstacle, but is capped, and employers must pay employees at least 80% of their average earnings (or the minimum wage). Support is provided for a maximum of 6 months within 24 consecutive months, and employers must maintain the supported job for at least 2 months after the period of work obstacle.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full127" style="display:none;">The amendment to the Labor Code, effective from March 1, 2021, and January 1, 2022, introduces several changes. Employees can now choose between meal vouchers and a financial contribution to meals, with the amount being at least 55% of the minimum value of a meal voucher. Employers who already have voucher contracts are exempt until those expire, but no later than January 1, 2023, is when electronic meal vouchers are planned. Temporary assignment of employees between parent and subsidiary companies is simplified, removing the requirement for objective operational reasons and a minimum employment period if the assignment is unpaid.<br><br>The definition of an employee permanently caring for a child is clarified, affecting vacation entitlement. Employees personally caring for a child, including through shared custody, are entitled to five weeks of vacation. Regular work from home, whether termed homeworking or teleworking, must be agreed upon in the employment contract. Employees have the right to disconnect, are treated equally to on-site staff, and employers may be obligated to cover increased expenses. The trial period is extended by any full-day absences of the employee.<br><br>Employers can now terminate employment when an employee turns 65 and is eligible for a retirement pension. Fifteen-year-olds who haven't completed compulsory education can be employed for light work with labor inspectorate permission. Students retain their student status until October 31st of the year they graduate. Disputes about trade union representation at a workplace are resolved by an arbitrator appointed by mutual agreement or by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full129" style="display:none;">The article discusses upcoming amendments to the Labor Code and the Tax Code in Slovakia. The Labor Code amendment, expected to be effective from January 1, 2022, addresses issues with meal vouchers, allowing employers to contribute up to 100% of the meal allowance for business trips (5-12 hours), capped at €5.10 with tax and levy exemptions. It also permits retroactive meal voucher and financial contribution payments to alleviate calculation issues due to unforeseen circumstances. Self-employed individuals can claim €5.10 for meals per workday without needing to provide proof.<br><br>The Tax Code amendment proposes several changes, including abolishing registration cards, reducing the binding opinion fee to €1,000 (or €500 for highly reliable taxpayers), introducing a tax reliability index with associated benefits and drawbacks, and implementing a mechanism to exclude individuals who severely breach tax obligations from holding statutory positions in companies. Other changes include eliminating summary protocols, requiring evidence for excused absences from tax proceedings, enabling joint acts for evidence collection, allowing witness and expert testimony via videoconference, streamlining the delivery of tax assessment protocols, clarifying tax debt extinction, and addressing bank account registration and VAT liability. VAT payers will be required to register their bank accounts for business use with the Financial Directorate, and the Directorate will publish and update these accounts daily. Purchasers will have the ability to pay VAT liability of sellers to the tax office directly, in the event the seller fails to do so. Most of these changes are expected to be effective from January 1, 2022, with bank account registration required by November 30, 2021.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full131" style="display:none;">Experts Erika Matwij and Martin Kiňo from the Association of Family Businesses Partners discuss current topics relevant to family businesses. Succession planning is a key issue, with the present situation offering an opportune moment for the younger generation to step up. The external pressures of the COVID-19 crisis have highlighted the need for well-defined family and business relationships. Owners should involve successors in management and problem-solving, despite the challenges of being both a leader and a mentor.<br><br>Preparing the next generation involves careful management transfer. An academy for successors helps develop essential skills through practical training and internships in successful family businesses. The program focuses on understanding the successor role, managing generational differences, and developing business strategies, brand building, international expansion, controlling, and innovation management.<br><br>If a family successor is unavailable, hiring a professional manager is an option, either internally or externally. The key is to find someone whose values and management principles align with the owner's. Alternatively, seeking an investor can bring in new management or lead to a full acquisition.<br><br>The upcoming legislation regulating trust and foundation funds is sparking interest in protecting family and business assets. Holding structures are becoming standard, improving financial transparency and cost allocation. These structures facilitate risk diversification and investor access. Trust and foundation funds can further protect assets by preventing fragmentation and ensuring support for family members, even excluding certain individuals. These funds, managed by a trustee appointed by the founder, also protect against mismanagement and third-party claims, offering a degree of anonymity. Standard operating costs are comparable to those of a regular business. Super deductions for research and development expenses and patent boxes for income from self-developed intangible assets are underutilized tax incentives worth exploring.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full132" style="display:none;">Effective May 1, 2021, amendments to the Building Act regarding advertising structures come into force. Advertising structures will now only be permitted for a definite period, not exceeding three years, through the building permit process. Previously, advertising structures could be permitted indefinitely.<br><br>If the owner does not apply for an extension, they are obligated to remove the advertising structure within 30 days after its permit expires. This also applies if the building authority decides not to extend the permit; the structure must be removed within 30 days of the decision becoming legally binding. Failure to comply can result in the decision serving as an enforcement title for execution.<br><br>The range of entities that can initiate the removal of illegal advertising structures is expanded to include municipalities for structures within their administrative areas. The process for removing illegal advertising structures (those without a building permit or in violation of one) is simplified, allowing the building authority to issue consent for removal within 30 days of a notification.<br><br>Furthermore, penalties for non-compliance are increased. These penalties vary based on the size of the advertising surface, rising from the current €150-€450 to €450-€1,350. All existing building permits for advertising structures issued indefinitely will become valid for a limited period of up to three years from the law's effective date, meaning until April 30, 2024. The law itself took effect on May 1, 2021.<br><br>It is recommended to consult with a construction professional to identify affected advertising structures and adjust accounting depreciation periods to three years or multiples thereof, aligning with potential permit extensions.</p>

The amendment allows for the inclusion of wage costs that were supported by public funds within active labor market measures related to the declaration of an emergency situation, state of emergency, and the elimination of their consequences. This refers to support within this type of measure, but only within the measure through a lump-sum contribution for each employee depending on the decline in revenue during the emergency situation (so-called measure 3B). This fact is defined in § 30c paragraph 5 letter a) of the Income Tax Act. This option will be used when filing a tax return after December 31, 2020.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The amendment to the Income Tax Act in Slovakia, specifically § 30c paragraph 5 letter a), introduces a change regarding the deductibility of research and development (R&D) costs. Previously, costs supported by public funds were ineligible for deduction. However, the amendment now permits the inclusion of wage costs that received public funding as part of active labor market measures. This applies specifically to lump-sum contributions provided to employees based on revenue decline during emergency situations (measure 3B). This new provision can be utilized for tax returns filed after December 31, 2020, offering businesses a more favorable tax treatment for R&D expenses incurred under specific government support schemes during crises.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full134" style="display:none;">Clarification of Criteria for Determining Corporate Tax Residence<br><br>The criteria for determining a legal entity's tax residence in Slovakia have been refined. A legal entity is considered a Slovak resident if its registered office or place of effective management is within the Slovak Republic. The concept of "place of effective management" now specifically refers to the location where crucial managerial and business decisions for the entity as a whole are made or received, regardless of who makes them. Decisions pertaining to smaller organizational units or administrative matters are excluded. This clarification is particularly relevant for companies with international ownership structures, especially those with foreign holding companies.<br><br>Changes to the 15% Reduced Tax Rate Application<br><br>Effective from January 1, 2021, the 15% tax rate is exclusively for taxpayers (legal entities or sole traders) whose taxable income does not exceed €49,790 per tax period. This applies even to micro-taxpayers, and only taxable income is considered for this threshold. For the 2020 tax period, the income limit for the 15% rate was €100,000.<br><br>Exclusion of Cross-Border Workers<br><br>The method for determining tax residence for individuals who cross the border daily to work in Slovakia and would otherwise be tax residents has changed. From January 1, 2021, their tax residence will be determined based on tie-breaker rules outlined in the relevant double taxation treaties. A similar approach applies to legal entities to resolve dual residency conflicts.<br><br>Exemption for "First Aid" Labor Policy Benefits<br><br>Benefits provided under active labor policy measures for employment retention projects during declared states of emergency, states of emergency, or exceptional states related to COVID-19 are now tax-exempt. This includes "First Aid" contributions intended to support employers during the pandemic. Similarly, benefits provided by the Ministry of Culture to support artists are also exempt. Expenses incurred for these tax-exempt incomes must be excluded from tax-deductible expenses.<br><br>Micro-Taxpayer's Tax Deduction for Bad Debt Write-off<br><br>From January 1, 2021, micro-taxpayers can deduct the write-off of bad debts, up to the amount of the provision created for them, provided the debt was previously included in taxable income.<br><br>Annual Tax Reconciliation by Any Employer<br><br>Starting in 2021, employees can request an annual tax reconciliation from any employer they received income from during the tax period, not just the last one where they claimed tax reliefs. The process for calculating the annual tax reconciliation has also been clarified.<br><br>Elimination of Reconciliation for Paid vs. Due Tax Advances<br><br>The obligation to reconcile the difference between paid and due tax advances by the end of the month following the tax return deadline has been removed. Paid advances for a tax period will be applied towards the tax liability for that period.<br><br>Abolition of 13th and 14th Salary Tax Exemption<br><br>The tax exemption for 13th and 14th salaries, provided for summer holidays and Christmas, has been abolished effective January 1, 2021. The last eligible period for this exemption was for Christmas bonuses paid by December 31, 2020.<br><br>Gradual Change in Child Tax Bonus Amounts<br><br>The tax bonus for children has been adjusted. From January 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021, children under six receive double the bonus, while older children receive one times the bonus. Further adjustments are scheduled from July 1, 2021, with increased bonuses for older children until December 31, 2022.<br><br>Cancellation of Spa Care Tax Relief<br><br>The tax-exempt portion of income for spa care and related services, up to €50 per year, has been canceled from 2021. The last time this relief could be claimed was for the 2020 tax period.<br><br>Clarification of Definition for Non-Cooperating States<br><br>From 2021, countries on the EU's "black list" of non-cooperating tax jurisdictions, those not applying corporate income tax, or those with a 0% corporate income tax rate will be excluded from Slovakia's national list of cooperating states. This exclusion will not affect the application of double taxation treaties.<br><br>Establishment of a Permanent Establishment<br><br>If a foreign tax entity establishes a permanent establishment in Slovakia, it must retroactively fulfill employer obligations, including tax withholding and reporting, from the start of the activity. The foreign entity must file a tax return and pay the tax within three months of discovering the permanent establishment. The existence of a permanent establishment is assessed from the date of commencing activities on Slovak territory as per contractual agreements.<br><br>Other Changes from January 1, 2021<br><br>Preferential tax depreciation for buildings in the spa industry and for company apartments has been abolished. The tax-exempt amount for spa care and related services for individuals has been canceled.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>Slovak tax law amendments effective January 1, 2021, introduced significant changes. Corporate tax residence criteria are now more precise, focusing on the place of effective management. The 15% reduced tax rate is limited to lower-income taxpayers, with a reduced threshold from previous years. The exemption for cross-border workers' tax residence determination has been removed, relying on double taxation treaties. Benefits from the "First Aid" program for employment retention during COVID-19 are tax-exempt, as are cultural support payments. The 13th and 14th salaries are no longer tax-exempt. Child tax bonus amounts have been adjusted, with increases for older children over time. Tax relief for spa care has been abolished, as has preferential depreciation for spa buildings and company apartments. The definition of non-cooperating states has been clarified, excluding those on the EU's blacklist. Foreign entities establishing a permanent establishment in Slovakia now have specific retroactive compliance obligations. The annual tax reconciliation process has been simplified, allowing employees to choose any employer. The reconciliation of tax advance differences has also been eliminated.</p>

A subject will be considered a separate taxpayer if the state where the subject was established considers it transparent, as will be viewed from the point of view of the country of the non-resident founder of the company. For reverse hybrid entities, if the entity is considered transparent in its country of origin but a separate taxable entity in the founder's country, creating a risk of double non-taxation, income attributable to foreign shareholders owning 50% or more of the transparent company will be taxed at the corporate income tax rate of 21% at the level of the transparent company if it cannot be taxed through a permanent establishment. A new reporting obligation is introduced for foreign shareholders of transparent companies to declare the company's status.<br><br>CFC rules are extended to individuals to prevent profit shifting to tax havens. An entity is considered a CFC if an individual, alone or with related parties, holds at least 10% of the capital, voting rights, or profit share or exercises actual control and is located in a non-cooperative state or has an effective tax rate below 10%. Profits from CFCs will be taxed at 25% or 35% before distribution. Tax authorities will also notify taxpayers of the amount and due dates of income tax prepayments at least 5 days before the payment deadline.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full136" style="display:none;">The DAC6 directive mandates reporting obligations for companies engaging in cross-border tax planning, primarily aimed at securing tax advantages. This initiative, driven by the EU and OECD, seeks to enhance tax transparency and information exchange among member states, combating aggressive tax practices and promoting fair taxation.<br><br>The reporting duty falls upon intermediaries (tax advisors, lawyers, accountants, auditors) or users involved in cross-border arrangements. Intermediaries are obligated to report unless bound by confidentiality, in which case the responsibility shifts to the user. A cross-border arrangement involves at least two member states, a member and non-member state, or aims to circumvent automatic financial account information exchange or beneficial ownership identification. The arrangement must meet specific hallmarks, either general or specific, with general hallmarks and some specific ones requiring a "main benefit test," demonstrating a primary purpose of achieving a tax advantage.<br><br>Hallmarks include confidentiality agreements, success-based fees, standardized structures, transfer and cross-border use of losses, income conversion, multiple depreciation claims, and transfer pricing issues with hard-to-value intangibles and opaque ownership structures.<br><br>Failure to comply with DAC6 reporting deadlines can result in penalties up to €30,000. Companies should conduct internal analyses of international arrangements and consult tax advisors to navigate the complexities of DAC6, as the reporting requirement covers a broad spectrum of legal and tax scenarios.</p>

      <h2>Payment of Income Tax Prepayments for Legal Entities from 2021</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full137" style="display:none;">Corporate income tax advance payments are governed by Section 42 of Act No. 595/2003 Coll. An obligation to pay advance payments arises if the corporate income tax for the previous tax period exceeds EUR 5,000. Depending on the amount of this last known tax liability, the corporation is obliged to pay quarterly advance payments, due by the end of the respective calendar quarter, if the tax for the previous period exceeded EUR 5,000 but did not exceed EUR 16,600, or monthly advance payments, due by the end of the respective calendar month, if the tax exceeded EUR 16,600.<br><br>The obligation to pay advance payments does not apply if the tax administrator determines otherwise, specifically to taxpayers whose tax for the previous period did not exceed EUR 5,000, those in liquidation or bankruptcy, or those filing a tax return for the first time, until the deadline for filing the return. In this case, the advance payments due up to the filing deadline are settled by the end of the month following the filing deadline.<br><br>The tax for the previous period is calculated from the tax base reduced by tax loss stated in the tax return filed for the period immediately preceding the current one, using the tax rate specified in that return, reduced by any applicable allowances. The calculation considers the tax rate valid in the relevant period (either 21% or, from 2020, potentially 15% for taxpayers with income not exceeding EUR 100,000, later replaced by 49,790 EUR). From 2021, only taxable income is included in the income calculation for the 15% rate.<br><br>Advance payments are calculated differently before and after the tax return filing deadline. Before the deadline, they're based on the "last known tax liability" from the previous year. After the deadline, they're based on the tax for the previous period as reported in the filed tax return, considering the taxpayer's taxable income and applicable tax rate (15% or 21%). A change effective from January 1, 2021, eliminated the obligation to settle any difference between advance payments made before the filing deadline and the actual tax liability calculated in the tax return. Overpaid amounts are either credited towards future payments or refunded upon request.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full138" style="display:none;">In October 2020, the Slovak government introduced "First Aid Plus," an extension of the original "First Aid" project, aimed at increasing and prolonging financial assistance for job protection and expanding the eligibility of applicants. Further changes are planned from February 2021, with the "First Aid Plus Plus" project intending to broaden target groups and increase aid amounts, extending the project until June 30, 2021.<br><br>Entities starting work or business by February 1, 2021, can apply, and contributions can be claimed for employees hired by the same date. Employers, including the self-employed acting as employers, could previously apply for aid under measures 1 and 3, covering employers with mandatory closures (Measure 1) or inability to assign work (Measure 3A) or revenue decline (Measure 3B).<br><br>The "First Aid Plus Plus" project increases contributions under Measures 1 and 3A to 100% of the total labor cost (up from 80%), capped at €1,100. Measure 3B expands revenue decline categories from four to seven, ranging from €330 to €870, with the maximum contribution for an 80% or more revenue decline rising from €810 to €870. These improved conditions apply to requests and reports submitted for February 2021 onwards, up to €1.6 million per company. After exceeding this limit, contributions will continue at 80% of the total labor cost. Self-employed individuals (SZČO) who aren't employers could apply for contributions under Measures 2 and 4, with Measure 2 covering those with mandatory closures or revenue decline, and Measures 4A and 4B targeting specific groups. "First Aid Plus Plus" increases financial contributions under Measure 2 by changing revenue decline categories and raising the flat-rate contribution from €330 to €870. Measure 4A and 4B provides a flat-rate contribution of €360, up from €315. These increases apply to requests and reports submitted for February 2021 onwards. The Ministry recommends self-employed individuals under Measure 4A and 4B to switch to Measure 2 for a potentially higher contribution of up to €870, provided they voluntarily obtain sickness and pension insurance by February 15, 2021.</p>

The amendment aims to support taxpayers economically impacted by pandemic measures by allowing COVID-19 testing expenses to be included in tax costs and by easing the conditions for claiming the child tax bonus.<br><br>The amendment focuses on employees and self-employed individuals whose income fell below the required threshold for the tax bonus due to pandemic-related disruptions. These individuals received pandemic-related support, such as sick pay, childcare allowance, unemployment benefits, and subsidies for cultural workers. Because these income sources were tax-exempt, the individuals became ineligible for the child tax bonus.<br><br>The amendment revises the conditions for claiming the tax bonus by including pandemic-related income in taxable income. Specifically, income from active labor market policies, subsidies from the Ministry of Culture for cultural workers, and pandemic-related sick pay and childcare allowance are included.

This includes testing for employees, their cohabitating relatives, the self-employed, their relatives, and individuals working at the taxpayer's business location. This measure applies retroactively to the entire pandemic, including the 2020 tax year. Crucially, non-monetary benefits related to employee and relative testing will not be taxed during the pandemic. Employers who have already completed their 2020 tax reconciliation can issue corrections. The amendment also addresses the criteria for claiming the tax bonus during the pandemic, offering further financial relief.

The 50% tax reduction for special vehicles (hybrids, CNG/LNG/hydrogen powered) remains unchanged. These changes are applicable for the 2020 tax return, exceptionally due on March 31, 2021, and tax advances for 2021 are waived. The Ministry of Finance will provide a new tax return form.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full143" style="display:none;">A July 1, 2021 amendment to the VAT Act introduces significant changes, particularly concerning distance selling. The term "distance selling" is replaced by "distance selling of goods within the European Union" or "distance selling of goods imported from third countries." The legislation now defines these sales and updates rules for determining the place of supply to align with taxation at the place of consumption within the EU.<br><br>Foreign entities registered for distance selling in Slovakia under the previous § 6 will have their VAT identification numbers automatically considered valid under § 5, ensuring continued registration as taxpayers. The amendment also establishes specific places of supply for distance selling within the EU and certain services to non-taxable persons, with a unified threshold of €10,000 for cross-border sales annually.<br><br>This aims to reduce administrative burdens by eliminating country-specific thresholds for distance selling. The changes also introduce special procedures, including the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) for specific services to EU consumers by non-EU suppliers, and the expanded One Stop Shop (OSS) covering intra-EU distance sales of goods and services supplied by EU businesses to non-taxable persons in other member states. The Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) facilitates VAT declaration and payment for imported goods valued up to €150, with online platforms taking responsibility for tax collection.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full144" style="display:none;">**Correction of Tax Base and VAT Deduction for Uncollectible Receivables in Slovakia**<br><br>Under new Slovakian VAT regulations, VAT payers can adjust their tax base if a customer fails to fully or partially pay for goods or services after the VAT obligation arises, and the receivable becomes uncollectible. The tax base can be reduced up to the unpaid amount. The difference between the original and adjusted tax base and VAT is reported in the tax period the receivable becomes uncollectible.<br><br>A receivable becomes uncollectible based on specific legal circumstances, such as execution proceedings, bankruptcy proceedings, debt relief proceedings, or the debtor ceasing to exist without a legal successor.<br><br>Concurrently, if a VAT payer reduces the tax base due to an uncollectible receivable, the customer who deducted VAT on the unpaid supply must correct their VAT deduction. This correction occurs in the tax period when the customer receives the adjustment document from the supplier.<br><br>Furthermore, a new VAT return form and control statement will be introduced from January 1, 2021. These forms will accommodate the tax base adjustments for uncollectible receivables and the corresponding VAT deduction corrections. The revised control statement should be used for tax periods starting on or after January 1, 2021.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full146" style="display:none;">The amendment to Law No. 361/2014 Z. z. on motor vehicle tax, effective January 1, 2020, introduced several changes. The subject of the tax now includes vehicles registered in Slovakia used for business during the tax period. "Used for business" encompasses actual use, accounting entries, inclusion in tax records, claiming expenses, or use by specific taxpayer categories. Vehicles must also belong to categories L, M, N, or O.<br><br>Tax liability arises on the first day of the month when a vehicle is registered and used for business. A new provision states tax liability arises for a new taxpayer on the first day of the month following a change in taxpayer within the same calendar month. Tax liability ceases with vehicle deregistration, cessation of business, theft confirmation, taxpayer dissolution, ownership transfer, or termination of vehicle use.<br><br>Vehicles with special license plates (M for new/test vehicles, H for historic, S for sports) are not subject to tax. Hybrid, CNG, LNG, and hydrogen-powered vehicles benefit from a 50% annual tax rate reduction. Employers paying travel allowances for employees' private vehicles used for business must now report the start and end of tax liability for these vehicles in the tax return's notes.<br><br>Regarding prepayments, taxpayers with an estimated tax below €700 pay no prepayments. Those with estimated tax between €700 and €8300 pay quarterly, and those above €8300 pay monthly. Taxpayers were exempt from prepayments from April 2020 due to COVID-19 measures, but this exemption ended on September 30, 2020. Unpaid prepayments are settled in the final tax return.<br><br>---<br><br>The amendment to Slovak motor vehicle tax law, effective January 1, 2020, redefined taxable vehicles to include those registered in Slovakia and used for business, encompassing various forms of business association with the vehicle, not just actual use. Vehicles must fall into categories L, M, N, or O. Tax liability commences when a vehicle is registered and used for business. New provisions address changes in taxpayer status and cessation of tax liability.<br><br>Specific vehicle categories, including newly manufactured, historic, and sports vehicles identified by special license plates, are exempt. Hybrid, CNG, LNG, and hydrogen-powered vehicles receive a 50% tax rate reduction. Employers using employee-owned vehicles for business must now report tax liability changes for these vehicles. COVID-19 pandemic measures temporarily suspended motor vehicle tax prepayments from April 2020, with the exemption ending September 30, 2020, requiring outstanding prepayments to be settled in the annual tax return.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full147" style="display:none;">On September 29, 2020, Act No. 264/2020 came into effect, amending Act No. 67/2020 of the Collection of Laws on certain extraordinary measures in the financial sector in connection with the spread of the dangerous infectious human disease COVID-19, with the aim of cancelling several measures. According to the adopted amendment, the pandemic period applied to specific financial measures is abolished.<br><br>The changes will primarily concern the submission of tax returns and payment of taxes, payment of advance payments, preparation of financial statements, and filing of financial statements into the register of financial statements. For tax purposes, the pandemic period is considered to have ended on September 30, 2020. Based on the amendment to Act No. 67/2020, Section 2, Paragraph 3 was supplemented stating that for purposes of measures under specific sections (§ 3 and 4, § 6, § 8 to 12, § 16 to 18a, § 20 to 24a, § 24c to 24h, § 24j, § 24n and 24o, § 33, 34, § 36 paragraphs 1 and 3, § 36a, and § 36c paragraphs 1 and 2), the pandemic period is considered to have ended on September 30, 2020, while for measures under § 7, 24i, and 31, the pandemic period is considered to have ended on December 31, 2020. These changes effectively roll back certain COVID-19 related financial relief measures.<br><br>This article explains a legislative amendment that terminated certain pandemic-related financial measures in Slovakia. Effective September 29, 2020, Act No. 264/2020 modified Act No. 67/2020. The core change is the abolition of the designated "pandemic period" for specific financial obligations. Crucially, for tax purposes, the pandemic period ended on September 30, 2020. This impacts tax return submissions, tax payments, advance payments, and financial statement preparation and filing. The amendment clarifies that for most financial measures, the pandemic period concluded on September 30, 2020, but for a few specific measures, it extended to December 31, 2020. This effectively signals the winding down of some financial support mechanisms put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

The option to prove tax costs based on consumption proven by a document issued by an authorized organization or according to a company's internal act (for trucks and work mechanisms) remains.<br><br>Waiver of settlement of differences in paid prepayments<br><br>Legal entities that paid lower prepayments or no prepayments during the pandemic, based on adopted measures, will not have to settle the difference in prepayments by the end of the calendar month following the deadline for filing tax returns. This applies to prepayments paid and due from the beginning of the tax period until the deadline for filing tax returns, i.e., for the tax period:<br>a. which is a calendar year starting no earlier than January 1, 2020,<br>b. in which there was a change in the tax period from a calendar year to a fiscal year, and which began after January 1, 2020,<br>c. which is a fiscal year for which the regular or extended deadline for filing income tax returns expired during the pandemic period,<br>d. which is a fiscal year, at least one month of which falls into the calendar year 2020.<br><br>The deadline for submitting documentation requested by the tax administrator for a tax audit will be doubled.<br><br>The minimum deadline for responding to a tax audit protocol, within which the audited taxpayer must comment on the findings in the protocol, will be extended from 15 days to 30 working days. This deadline will first apply to protocols prepared after June 30, 2020.<br><br>Conditions for applying tax loss deductions under Lex Corona are clarified.<br><br>If the deadline for filing an income tax return expires in 2020 for multiple tax periods, the taxpayer can only apply the preferential tax loss deduction in one tax period.<br><br>Prohibition of Social Insurance Agency from requesting information it already possesses.<br><br>With the amendment to the Social Insurance Act, the obligation for employers to notify the Social Insurance Agency (hereinafter "SP") of facts that SP can ascertain otherwise will be abolished. According to the amendment, the employer's obligation is canceled to:<br>e. de-register from the employer register kept by the Social Insurance Agency – SP will automatically terminate registration upon de-registration of the last employee;<br>f. notify SP of changes in employee data (name, surname, permanent or temporary residence) – SP will obtain data from the Register of Natural Persons. This obligation is also canceled for self-employed individuals;<br>g. report changes in data on the start and end dates of employment or other legal relationships with the employer;<br>h. report changes in data regarding whether an employee is a statutory body of the employer and owns at least 50% of the employer's assets, or a member of the statutory body and owns at least 50% of the employer's assets;<br>i. notify SP of the start and end of maternity or parental leave for employees.<br><br>Furthermore, the deadline for employers to submit a pension insurance record for employees who do not apply for an old-age pension after the termination of employment will be extended from 8 days to 30 days from the termination of employment. The obligation to submit a report to SP after an inspection on the fulfillment of measures to rectify identified deficiencies and their causes is also abolished.<br><br>Amendments to tax and social security laws effective January 1st at the earliest.<br><br>Legal regulations governing social security contributions and taxes will be amended only once a year, effective January 1st of the following year at the earliest.<br><br>Numerous other laws were also changed as part of the package. The adopted measures will remove bureaucratic restrictions for small and medium-sized enterprises, such as: cancellation of certain obligations for travel agencies, cancellation of bank levies, cancellation of the obligation to affix a control sticker to the vehicle's windshield as proof of technical inspection, emission inspection, and originality inspection, cancellation of the obligation to have a displayed complaint procedure in a visible place, and many others.<br><br>***<br><br>This article summarizes key changes from a Slovak business improvement package. The mandatory audit thresholds for companies are gradually increasing until 2022. Fuel expense deductions will be more realistic, automatically increasing consumption figures by 20%. Companies that paid reduced tax prepayments during the pandemic will not need to settle the difference until after the tax return deadline. Deadlines for responding to tax audit findings are doubled to 30 working days. The application of tax loss deductions is limited to one period per taxpayer under Lex Corona. The Social Insurance Agency's ability to request information it already possesses is restricted, reducing employer notification burdens. Tax and social security laws will be amended annually, effective January 1st. Other measures include removing bureaucratic hurdles for SMEs, such as for travel agencies and vehicle inspections.</p>

      <h2>TEMPORARY RENT PROTECTION AND RENT SUBSIDY</h2>
      <p class="date">21.06.2020</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary154">TEMPORARY RENT PROTECTION<br><br>A new amendment to Act No. 62/2020 Coll. on certain extraordinary measures related to the spread of a dangerous infectious human disease COVID-19 and in justice, and amendin</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full154" style="display:none;">TEMPORARY RENT PROTECTION<br><br>A new amendment to Act No. 62/2020 Coll. on certain extraordinary measures related to the spread of a dangerous infectious human disease COVID-19 and in justice, and amending and supplementing certain laws, referred to as the "Temporary Rent Protection Act," provides temporary rent protection for tenants (both business and non-business) if they fall into arrears with rent and other rent-related payments due to circumstances stemming from the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>Under Section 3b of Act No. 62/2020 Coll. on Temporary Protection, a landlord cannot unilaterally terminate a lease of real estate (including residential and non-residential premises) until December 31, 2020, for a tenant's delay in paying rent, including charges for services typically associated with the lease, that became due between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, provided the tenant's delay resulted from circumstances originating from the spread of COVID-19. The tenant must sufficiently substantiate the reason for the delay. Other grounds for lease termination remain unaffected.<br><br>For a tenant to receive temporary rent protection, they must meet these conditions: the rent arrears must be for the period between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020; the payment delay must be due to COVID-19-related circumstances; and the reason for the delay must be sufficiently evidenced. Delays occurring before April 1, 2020, or after June 30, 2020, allow landlords to terminate the lease unilaterally, regardless of the reason for the delay. The act does not prohibit termination for other reasons and does not specify landlords' claims for tenant payment delays, such as late interest. After December 31, 2020, tenants lose this protection, and landlords can terminate leases for delays occurring between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020.<br><br>SUBSIDY FOR RENT PAYMENT<br><br>The amendment to Act No. 71/2013 Coll. on subsidies and the supplementing of Act No. 62/2020 Coll. has introduced a new state contribution – a subsidy for rent payment. This subsidy aims to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on businesses.<br><br>Conditions for the subsidy include an existing lease agreement, rent agreed in monetary form, the tenant's right to use the rented property acquired no later than February 1, 2020, and that the use of the property was hindered due to government measures against COVID-19. Hindrances include closure, interruption of schooling, or significant restrictions on public access. The subsidy can be applied for by landlords, including individuals and legal entities, whether business or non-business. Changes to lease agreements made after March 12, 2020, are disregarded for subsidy purposes. The "rented property" for this subsidy includes commercial spaces used for selling goods or services to consumers and market places.<br><br>The subsidy is granted based on the rent discount agreed between landlord and tenant, capped at 50% of the rent for the period of hindered use. This requires a joint application signed by both parties. The subsidy does not cover ancillary services like energy payments or turnover-based rent components. If services are inseparable from rent, a 5% reduction in rent is assumed. For state property managers, rent is automatically halved, making the subsidy 50% of the original rent. The application is submitted electronically via a form on the Ministry of Economy's website. The electronic form, bearing authorized signatures, serves as proof of the discount agreement. The subsidy is approved via electronic notification to both parties. To qualify, applicants must have settled financial relations with the state budget, have no enforcement proceedings against them, not have violated illegal employment bans in the past three years, and have no outstanding social or health insurance payments. Other conditions, like not being in insolvency or bankruptcy, not having a ban on receiving subsidies, and not having a ban on receiving EU funds, are confirmed by declaration. If the subsidy exceeds €100,000, the beneficial owner must be identified, and false declarations can lead to repayment.<br><br>If the tenant has paid rent for the entire or partial period of hindered use, the subsidy can be granted for a period equal to the hindrance, up to 50% of the rent, based on the agreed discount. If no discount was agreed upon, the tenant can pay the outstanding rent in up to 48 equal monthly installments, starting the month after the state of emergency ends, with payments due by the 15th of each month, unless otherwise agreed.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full155" style="display:none;">New statements for the "First Aid" project to support employment retention are available on pomahameludom.sk as of May 17, 2020. The project offers four measures: support for employers (including self-employed individuals who are employers) who closed operations due to the emergency, support for self-employed individuals whose businesses were closed by the Public Health Office or experienced a 20% revenue drop, support for employers retaining jobs during business interruptions, and support for self-employed individuals and single-owner limited liability companies with no other income since March 13, 2020.<br><br>Contribution amounts are being adjusted, with the maximum capped at 80% of an employee's gross wage for Measure 3B. For April, the flat-rate contribution has doubled compared to March for measures considering revenue decline (Measures 2 and 3B). Employers can switch measures for April and, with multiple operations, apply for Measures 1 and 3 concurrently on different premises. However, certain combinations of measures are mutually exclusive.<br><br>The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family apologized for errors in the April statements for Measures 1 and 3, requesting corrected submissions. Measure 4 has also seen changes, with new conditions for single-owner LLCs (no employees) and broader income exclusion criteria. Deadlines for applications for Measure 4 have been extended based on the period of no income.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full156" style="display:none;">On April 14, 2020, the government approved changes to the employment support project during the state of emergency, expanding aid for employers and employees. This is the third type of social assistance available from the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family starting April 17, 2020, in the form of contributions. Applications for the first and second measures began on April 6 and April 8, 2020, respectively.<br><br>The support measures aim to compensate for wage replacements or provide fixed contributions based on reduced revenue. Employers who were forced to close their operations can receive up to 80% of an employee's average earnings, capped at €1,100 per month. Other employers facing operational obstacles or revenue declines can receive contributions based on specific criteria. Self-employed individuals (SZČO) and individuals without other income are also eligible for support, with amounts varying based on their insurance status and revenue drops. For example, SZČO with at least a 10% revenue drop in March 2020 could receive €90, while an 80% drop in April/May could yield €540. A SOS subsidy of €210 per month is available for individuals who lost income due to the crisis and are not receiving pensions or other benefits. Eligibility criteria include being insured, having a revenue drop, and fulfilling tax and social security obligations. Employers must commit to not terminating employment for two months after receiving support and demonstrate their financial standing. The definition of "revenue" for these contributions is specified for both legal entities and individuals.</p>

      <p class="summary" id="summary157">According to Slovak Government Regulation No. 104/2020, effective April 30, 2020, taxpayers who did not submit a declaration under Section 24a of Act No. 67/2020 on certain extraordinary measures in t</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full157" style="display:none;">According to Slovak Government Regulation No. 104/2020, effective April 30, 2020, taxpayers who did not submit a declaration under Section 24a of Act No. 67/2020 on certain extraordinary measures in the financial sector in connection with the spread of the dangerous contagious human disease COVID-19 (Lex Corona) by the tax return deadline, pay advance payments based on their 2019 tax liability if their 2019 tax liability was lower than their 2018 tax liability, and the 2019 tax return deadline falls within the pandemic period. This rule does not apply to advance payments determined by tax authorities.<br><br>The regulation aims to allow all taxpayers to pay income tax advance payments under more favorable conditions based on their filed tax returns, ensuring no one pays higher advance payments during the pandemic than before.<br><br>Taxpayers are categorized into four groups regarding advance payments:<br>1. Those whose revenue decreased by 40% compared to the same period in the previous year: They do not pay advance payments for the period immediately following the revenue drop until the end of the pandemic.<br>2. Those who filed their 2019 tax return during the pandemic and had a lower tax liability than in 2018: They pay advance payments based on the lower 2019 liability and will receive a refund for overpaid advance payments from April 2020.<br>3. Those who filed their 2019 tax return during the pandemic and had a higher tax liability than in 2018: They continue to pay advance payments based on their 2018 liability until the end of the month following the crisis state's termination and must pay the difference between the 2018 and 2019 advance payments.<br>4. Those who wish to adjust their advance payment obligations differently: This can be done upon request to the tax authority, which will determine the advance payments.<br><br>If a taxpayer paid higher advance payments for April than permitted by Lex Corona, they can request a refund or use the difference for future payments. Refunds are processed within 30 days if requested after April 30, 2020, or by May 31, 2020, if requested by the end of April 2020.<br><br>Penalties apply for reducing a tax credit claimed during the pandemic and subsequently filing an amended return with a lower credit; a 100% penalty on the difference will be imposed, and the difference must be repaid. Lex Corona III also introduced changes regarding penalties for late payment of certain advance tax payments, withholding tax, or tax security amounts during the pandemic, with late payment interest applicable.</p>

      <h2>Update – Amendment to the Social Insurance Act and other acts – exemption of employer's contribution obligations for April 2020</h2>
      <p class="date">13.05.2020</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full158" style="display:none;">This exemption applies to employers or self-employed individuals (SZČO) who are compulsorily insured for sickness and pension benefits and whose operations were closed in April 2020 for at least 15 days, based on a decision by the Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic. Employers remain obligated to remit employee contributions by their original due dates.<br><br>Proof of closure will be demonstrated by the employer or insured SZČO through a sworn statement submitted to the Social Insurance Agency no later than May 18, 2020. Forms for the remission of social insurance contributions for April are available.<br><br>An amendment to the Employment Services Act expands the eligibility for contributions under the job retention project. This includes applicants who are permitted to fulfill their tax and contribution obligations or claims towards the Labour, Social Affairs, and Family Office through installments. It also covers cases where contributions could not be drawn due to non-compliance with tax and contribution obligations or claims for February 2020; in these instances, specific conditions under the aforementioned act will be considered met.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>The Slovak Republic has introduced an exemption for employers and self-employed individuals (SZČO) who were forced to close their businesses for at least 15 days in April 2020 due to public health authority decisions. These entities can apply for a waiver of social insurance contributions for that month, provided they submit a sworn statement by May 18, 2020. Employers must still remit employee-paid contributions on time.<br><br>Furthermore, amendments to the Employment Services Act broaden eligibility for job retention project contributions. This now includes those who can pay tax and social security dues in installments and those whose applications were previously rejected due to February 2020 compliance issues. These individuals will now be considered compliant regarding those specific requirements. This aims to provide further support to businesses and maintain employment during the economic challenges.</p>

      <h2>Government Bill on Social Insurance and Other Laws – Establishment and Termination of Mandatory Sickness and Pension Insurance for Self-Employed Persons</h2>
      <p class="date">13.05.2020</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full160" style="display:none;">On May 11, 2020, a new government bill concerning social insurance and other laws was submitted, specifically regulating the commencement and termination of mandatory sickness and pension insurance for self-employed individuals (SZČO). This proposal targets SZČO who had not yet filed their 2019 tax returns by March 31, 2020, as per Law No. 67/2020 Z. z. (Lex Corona), and those whose deadline for filing their 2019 personal income tax return was extended.<br><br>For SZČO whose extended deadline to file their 2019 tax return under Law No. 67/2020 Z. z. had passed, mandatory insurance commencement would be assessed from the first day of the third calendar month following the expiry of their tax filing deadline. Their mandatory insurance termination would be assessed on the last day of the second calendar month following the expiry of their tax filing deadline.<br><br>For SZČO with an extended 2019 tax filing deadline, a new assessment date for mandatory sickness and pension insurance was proposed, linked to their tax filing deadline. The decisive date was September 30, 2020. If the final day for filing the 2019 tax return was after September 30, 2020, the procedure would be the same as for the first group of SZČO. If the extended Lex Corona deadline expired by September 30, 2020, mandatory insurance would commence on December 1, 2020, and terminate on September 30, 2020.<br><br>A condition for insurance commencement is that the SZČO's income for 2019 exceeds 12 times the minimum assessment base (EUR 6,078). If income falls below this threshold, mandatory insurance will terminate.<br><br>Additionally, a transitional provision proposes temporarily suspending the mechanism for increasing meal allowances and basic vehicle reimbursement rates until December 31, 2021.<br><br>A government bill was presented on May 11, 2020, to amend the Social Insurance Act and related laws. It specifically addresses the commencement and termination of mandatory sickness and pension insurance for self-employed individuals (SZČO). The bill targets SZČO who had an extended deadline for filing their 2019 tax returns, either due to the Lex Corona law or other extensions.<br><br>For those with extended deadlines, the commencement of mandatory insurance is linked to the period after their tax filing deadline expires. For SZČO whose extended deadline was before September 30, 2020, insurance would start on December 1, 2020, and end on September 30, 2020. If their deadline was after September 30, 2020, their insurance commencement and termination dates would be determined by the third and second months after their extended filing deadline, respectively.<br><br>A crucial condition for the initiation of insurance is an annual income exceeding €6,078. Below this threshold, mandatory insurance ceases. The proposal also includes a temporary measure to freeze increases in meal and travel allowances until the end of 2021.</p>

The deduction is available to legal or natural persons who reported a positive tax base for the 2019 calendar tax year.<br><br>Taxpayers can claim these tax losses in their tax return filed between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, with a maximum aggregate deduction of €1 million. Taxpayers with a fiscal year ending on or after October 31, 2019, can also utilize this deduction, up to €1 million. However, this does not apply to fiscal years where the tax return filing deadline falls on December 31, 2019. Taxpayers who have already filed their 2019 tax return can use an amended or additional tax return.<br><br>Tax losses are deducted sequentially, starting with the earliest reported loss. For example, if losses were incurred from 2015 to 2018, the taxpayer would deduct a quarter of the 2015 loss, then the 2016 loss, the 2017 loss, and finally the 2018 loss, up to the calculated tax base and a maximum of €1 million. Keeping records is essential for claiming remaining losses in subsequent periods. This special deduction is optional, and taxpayers can opt for the standard loss amortization method if it is more advantageous.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full162" style="display:none;">The government has approved further COVID-19 related measures, dubbed Lex Corona III, which amends the law concerning extraordinary financial measures due to the pandemic. Key changes include expedited income tax refund processing for returns filed during the pandemic, with refunds now issued within 40 days of the calendar month the return was submitted. Businesses experiencing a 40% or greater revenue drop compared to the previous year can defer income tax prepayments due during the pandemic, provided they submit a declaration to the tax administrator. The obligation to pay vehicle tax prepayments from April 2020 onwards is waived, with the full amount due by January 31, 2021. Funds received from tax assignments for pandemic relief can now be used until the end of 2021. Unused tax losses from 2015-2018 can be deducted from the tax base for returns filed in 2020, up to a maximum of €1 million. The legislation also clarifies provisions regarding missed deadlines, tax audits, penalties, and the non-publication of VAT payers deregistered due to repeated non-compliance during the pandemic. Municipalities will be allowed to use development fees for current expenses.</p>

This proposal establishes details concerning individual financial statements and the scope of data from individual financial statements to be published for large accounting entities and public interest entities.<br><br>The objective of the proposed amendment to the measure is to enhance the notes to the financial statements for large accounting entities and public interest entities. This enhancement includes providing detailed information on overdue receivables and payables, as well as specifics on the provision of state aid, support, and subsidies. These additions are in response to legal regulations enacted during the declaration of an emergency situation under special provisions and to meet the requirement for transparent data disclosure within financial statements.<br><br>This amendment aims to improve the transparency and comprehensiveness of financial reporting for significant economic players in Slovakia. By requiring more detailed disclosures on overdue obligations, state aid, and subsidies, the Ministry of Finance intends to provide stakeholders with a clearer understanding of the financial health and operational activities of these entities. The changes are particularly relevant in the context of emergency situations, where governmental support mechanisms are often utilized. The goal is to ensure that public interest entities and large accounting firms present a more detailed and understandable financial picture.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full164" style="display:none;">Law no. 67/2020 Coll. introduced a special deadline for filing corporate income tax returns for 2019. The deadline, which expired or will expire during the pandemic period, has been extended to the end of the calendar month following the end of the pandemic. Taxpayers must also pay their 2019 income tax by this new deadline.<br><br>This postponement also affects advance tax payments. Under current regulations, advance payments for a given tax period are based on the tax liability declared in the previous year's return (i.e., for 2018). Therefore, taxpayers whose 2019 filing deadline fell within the pandemic period (from March 12, 2020) will continue to pay advances based on their 2018 tax liability until the new extended deadline. This applies even to those who filed their returns by the original March 31 deadline.<br><br>It is important to note that interest on late advance payments made during the pandemic period will be charged according to Section 156 of the Tax Procedure Code.<br><br>A government amendment approved on April 16, 2020, introduced a provision allowing for the suspension of advance tax payments. This applies to periods immediately following a quarter in which a taxpayer's revenue decreased by at least 40% compared to the same period in the previous year. To utilize this provision, taxpayers must submit a declaration confirming they meet the conditions no later than 15 days before the advance payment deadline.</p>

Employers' deadlines for tax reconciliation statements are also extended.<br><br>In accounting, deadlines for fulfilling obligations and submitting financial statements to the accounting register are extended to three months after the pandemic period ends or the tax return deadline, whichever is earlier.<br><br>The legislation allows recipients of designated tax shares (third sector) to use funds to alleviate pandemic consequences. It also exempts imported goods supporting disaster victims from customs duties and VAT. Taxpayer lists and VAT registrations of those violating obligations will not be updated during the pandemic. Tax audits and proceedings are suspended unless they involve financial refunds. Tax executions are postponed, and missed deadlines can be rectified by the end of the month following the pandemic's end. Administrative fees for pandemic-related actions are waived.<br><br>Financial market measures include state-backed loans and interest subsidies for SMEs through the Export-Import Bank of Slovakia and the Slovak Guarantee and Development Bank.

      <p class="full-content" id="full168" style="display:none;">Based on information from the Press Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic on March 16, 2020, the following proposals for measures, requiring legislative changes and future government/parliamentary decisions, were presented following discussions with business associations:<br><br>Discussions with banks are underway regarding the possibility of deferring loan and mortgage payments without negative credit reporting for borrowers. This includes freezing interest and principal payments for both individuals and legal entities.<br><br>Simplification and attractiveness of short-term preferential loans for businesses in selected sectors will be facilitated through the Slovak Guarantee and Development Bank (SZRB). Inspired by Germany, financial support for private sector investments, potentially via the Slovak Investment Holding (SIH) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), is proposed. This includes introducing systematic support for business investments in fixed assets through a "tax super-deduction" and accelerated depreciation. Adjustments to tax loss carryforward rules are also planned.<br><br>A postponement of tax return submission for all taxpayers from March 31 to June 30, 2020, is proposed, even for those who filed on time. The deadline for VAT payments will be extended, and penalties for late payments will be waived. Self-employed individuals will see a temporary cancellation of social and health contributions for three months (March-May), with these payments to be spread over the following 18 months. Payments to employees will be exempt from social, health contributions, and income tax.<br><br>Conditions for maintaining employment support will be radically simplified, including for small businesses and sole traders. The state budget will finance costs for supported electricity generation technologies for a defined period. The EU will be lobbied to allow the use of current ESIF funds to cover crisis impacts and economic recovery, initiating timely measures and rules. Changes to sickness benefit (OČR) conditions are also anticipated. Payment deadlines for customs debt will be extended by 30-40 days. Companies will not face penalties for failing to meet obligations like public tenders on time, and supervisory activities on businesses will be limited.<br><br>A state of emergency came into effect on March 16, 2020, at 6:00 AM, leading to the closure of most retail and service outlets, with exceptions for essential goods and services. Individuals returning from abroad are mandated to undergo 14-day isolation.<br><br>A summary of the measures implemented by the Central Crisis Staff and the Government is available.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full169" style="display:none;">To manage this situation, the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic has prepared a proposal of measures aimed at supporting the economy. These measures are designed to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on businesses and employees. The core purpose is to rapidly enhance the financial health, liquidity, and cash flow of businesses and workers, prevent the collapse of the business environment, and maintain critical processes essential for managing the virus spread, all while ensuring stability and minimizing panic.<br><br>The proposal outlines 31 measures categorized into four areas. Immediately implementable measures include short-term interest-free loans, deferrals of tax filing and payment deadlines to June 30, 2020, and extended deadlines for tax audits. Interest on delayed income tax prepayments will be waived if paid by year-end. A three-month deferral of social and health insurance contributions is proposed for companies and self-employed individuals from March to June 2020. Wages will be exempt from social, health, and income taxes for employers unable to assign work due to closures. Import duty payment deadlines will also be extended.<br><br>Measures requiring legislative changes include modifying conditions for sickness benefits, introducing "quarantine incapacity for work," and simplifying support for job retention for SMEs and the self-employed. Other measures focus on business prevention and procedures, such as a chatbot for entrepreneurs and extended storage times for postal packages. To foster economic recovery, the proposal suggests removing limitations on tax loss carryforwards and promoting private sector investment through accelerated depreciation and specific financial instruments.</p>

The aim is to ensure that the pandemic does not unduly hinder legal proceedings or the management of private affairs. The intention is to ease the burden of adhering to strict deadlines during a period of widespread disruption and uncertainty.<br><br>On March 26, 2020, Parliament passed a law enacting extraordinary measures in response to COVID-19, with a focus on suspending legal deadlines.

To mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spread, employers must assess workplace risks and take appropriate measures. These may include canceling business trips and events, ensuring hygiene facilities, educating employees, minimizing workplace visitors, isolating at-risk employees, ordering medical check-ups, and allowing remote work. Employers are also entitled to require employees to report their whereabouts in risk areas or other health-relevant information, even if it pertains to private life, as the interest in ensuring workplace health and safety prevails. If an employer knows an employee has returned from an affected country or been in contact with an infected person and continues to work, they can order an extraordinary medical examination to detect the virus, which the employee must undergo. In companies with employee representatives, these measures must first be discussed with them.<br><br>Quarantine<br><br>The Central Crisis Staff mandates a 14-day isolation for all individuals returning from abroad in designated facilities. Employees returning from affected countries without symptoms must monitor their health for 14 days and inform their employer of their return. Voluntary home isolation for 14 days is also an option for symptomatic employees. Employees not in risk areas or showing symptoms cannot arbitrarily stop working unless they arrange for leave or remote work with their employer. Unexcused absence is a breach of discipline.<br><br>Two types of quarantine exist: Mandatory and Voluntary. For mandatory quarantine ordered by public health authorities, the employer must excuse the absence and can reassign the employee to different work or location, including home office, without the employee's consent. If no alternative work is available, it constitutes a hindrance to work on the employee's side, which the employee must prove. Medical institutions must confirm such hindrances. During mandatory quarantine, employees are considered temporarily unable to work and are entitled to income replacement from the employer for the first 10 days, followed by sickness benefits. For voluntary quarantine due to suspicion of infection but without symptoms, employers can grant leave with or without wage replacement, or employees can use their vacation days.<br><br>Employer Options and Employee Entitlements<br><br>Employers can offer excused absences for temporary incapacity due to quarantine or caring for family members, but without wage replacement. Remote work ("home office") is only possible if agreed upon in company regulations or employment contracts, requiring written amendment if not initially included. For essential health measures, deviations can be documented via email. Home office can also reduce on-site staff density. Employers can order employees to take vacation with 14 days' notice, which can be shortened with employee consent in exceptional circumstances. Similarly, compensatory time off can be arranged, usually by agreement. Shift schedules must be announced at least a week in advance, but changes may require individual assessment of employment documentation. Employers can also grant paid or unpaid leave for other reasons, to be worked later. In cases where employers prevent at-risk employees from working or close facilities to prevent virus spread, it's considered a hindrance on the employer's side, entitling employees to average wage compensation, unless an agreement with employee representatives specifies otherwise. This also applies if production is temporarily halted due to external business circumstances. An agreement with employee representatives on serious operational reasons can allow for reduced wage compensation (at least 60% of average earnings), potentially saving employers up to 40% in wage replacement costs. These measures can be implemented proactively by employers to prevent infection spread, even without confirmed cases. Further advice on mitigating economic impacts is available upon contact.</p>

      <h2>Change in reporting of intra-Community acquisitions by a foreign person</h2>

      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full173" style="display:none;">Effective January 1, 2020, an amendment to Article 44 of the VAT Act clarifies tax exemption for domestic acquisition of goods from another Member State when the acquirer is entitled to a full VAT refund. This change primarily affects foreign entities without a Slovak VAT establishment (registered under Article 5) who qualify for a complete VAT refund.<br><br>Such foreign entities are now obligated to file a VAT return even for exempt acquisitions, reporting it on line 15 as an exempt supply, rather than declaring it as a taxable transaction and claiming an offset as previously done. This shift simplifies reporting while maintaining a neutral impact on the entity's overall tax liability. For instance, a foreign entity moving goods to Slovakia for exclusive supply to Slovak taxable persons, where VAT is reversed, qualifies for this exemption and must report the goods on line 15 of their VAT return.</p>

      <h2>Changes in the payment of advance corporate income tax from January 1, 2020</h2>

      <p class="summary" id="summary174">Changes in Corporate Income Tax Advance Payments from January 1, 2020<br><br>Effective January 1, 2020, several changes were introduced regarding corporate income tax advance payments. The lower threshold f</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full174" style="display:none;">Changes in Corporate Income Tax Advance Payments from January 1, 2020<br><br>Effective January 1, 2020, several changes were introduced regarding corporate income tax advance payments. The lower threshold for quarterly advance payments increased from €2,500 to €5,000. All calculations are now rounded mathematically to two decimal places.<br><br>The method for calculating advance tax payments has been altered. Previously, the tax for the preceding period used to determine advance payments was reduced by reliefs from the Corporate Income Tax Act, foreign tax credits, and tax withheld at source. From January 1, 2020, this calculation is reduced only by reliefs stipulated by the Act. The tax rate used for advance payment calculations is now based on the rate applicable in the period immediately preceding the advance payment period, not the current period as before.<br><br>For advance payments due before the tax return filing deadline for 2019, the "last known tax liability" is calculated based on the 2018 tax return, excluding items like foreign tax credits and withholding tax deductions, and was rounded down. Advance payments due after the 2019 tax return filing deadline are based on the 2019 tax return using the revised calculation method.<br><br>New entities now have until the end of the month following the tax return deadline to settle their advance payments, a change from the previous requirement to settle by the tax return deadline itself.<br><br>For self-employed individuals, the €5,000 threshold for advance payments also applies, but the calculation changes take effect after the 2020 tax return filing deadline. The "last known tax liability" for self-employed individuals is now calculated using a 19% tax rate on partial taxable income from specific sources (sections 6(1) and 6(2)), reduced by tax loss. It no longer includes income from employment, rental income, or income from works/performances, nor does it consider non-taxable amounts or tax bonuses.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full175" style="display:none;">The amendment to the law on vehicle operation and road traffic, effective January 1, 2020, introduces significant changes to the motor vehicle tax law. These updates, particularly concerning the definition of "business use" of a vehicle, will impact all entrepreneurs liable for this tax from that date. "Business use" is now broadly defined, including actual business use, accounting for the vehicle, inclusion in tax records, claiming related expenses, or use by an employee receiving travel allowances for non-business purposes. This means a vehicle can become subject to tax even before its actual business use, for instance, upon its inclusion in company assets.<br><br>Vehicles with special registration numbers (M for new/test vehicles, H for historic, S for sports) are now exempt from tax. The law also clarifies the timing of tax liability changes, ensuring no double taxation within a calendar year. Tax liability now ceases on the last day of the month of the event causing cessation, and new liability begins on the first day of the following month. The law also expands the reasons for tax cessation to include vehicle theft, confirmed by police. Furthermore, the tax period for businesses that temporarily suspend operations now ends on the last day of the month of suspension, with tax returns due within one month. For deceased taxpayers, the tax period ends on the last day of the month of death.<br><br>Other changes include a penalty for violating tax exemption conditions, a minimum tax payment threshold of 5 euros, and updated annual tax rates based on vehicle age, with reductions for hybrid, CNG, LNG, and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Advance tax payments are now calculated based on projected annual tax liability.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full176" style="display:none;">The Commercial Register amendment introduces significant changes, primarily mandating electronic submissions to the Commercial Register, with limited exceptions for physical documents. Inactive companies will be deleted, and required data will be updated. Specifically, the duration of legal entities will be recorded, and shareholders' dates of birth and identification numbers will be mandatory entries, requiring companies to update this information by September 30, 2021. Real estate used as a registered office will require a written consent with an officially certified signature from the property owner.<br><br>Foreign individuals conducting business in Slovakia will now require a trade license. Companies facing insolvency, indicated by a low equity-to-liability ratio, will be classified as companies in crisis, with an expanded definition including companies between dissolution and liquidation. Failure to file accounting statements for over six months will be grounds for court-ordered company dissolution. The liquidation process is being more strictly regulated, with a mandatory advance payment for the liquidator's fees and expenses. Additional liquidation will be introduced for companies found to possess assets after deregistration. Furthermore, significant asset transactions for dissolved companies will require expert appraisal and approval from the highest company body. These changes, largely effective from October 1, 2020, aim to formalize processes and ensure data accuracy within the Commercial Register.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full177" style="display:none;">The transposition of EU Directive 957/2018/EU into Slovak law significantly expands the scope of employment conditions for posted workers. Originally focused on minimum wage rates, the directive now mandates comparable working and remuneration conditions for foreign workers posted to Slovakia.<br><br>Specifically, host employers must now ensure that posted employees receive not only the minimum wage but also various mandatory wage components and allowances, including overtime pay, holiday pay, weekend pay, night work allowances, compensation for difficult working conditions, and other mandatory components stipulated by higher-level collective agreements. Furthermore, the directive clarifies that compensation for travel expenses, accommodation, and meals during business trips or commutes within Slovakia must be provided in accordance with Slovak law or applicable collective agreements. These allowances can be offset by comparable benefits provided by the posting employer under the laws of their home country.<br><br>The directive also introduces a distinction based on the duration of posting: short-term postings (up to 12 or 18 months) will apply the core conditions, while long-term postings (over 12 or 18 months) will generally require compliance with all Slovak labor law, with specific exceptions related to the commencement and termination of employment contracts and non-competition clauses. New information obligations for user employers regarding temporary employers are also introduced, along with rules for calculating posting periods in cases of successive postings.</p>

The minimum wage has also risen from €520 to €580 per month, with the hourly rate increasing from €2.989 to €3.333.<br><br>The monthly tax bonus for children is changing: for children over 6 years old, it will increase from €22.17 to €22.72. For children under 6, the increased bonus of €45.44 per month will apply throughout 2020. Annually, this amounts to a €545.28 tax reduction for children under 6 and €272.64 for children over 6.<br><br>The non-taxable part of the tax base for an individual will increase in 2020 due to both the higher cost of living minimum and an increased calculation coefficient, from €328.12 to €367.85 monthly. Annually, this translates to an increase from €3,937.35 to €4,414.20, potentially reducing an individual's tax liability by €90.60.<br><br>Income tax rates for 2020 are: 15% for individuals earning up to €100,000 annually, 19% for annual incomes up to €37,163.36 (an increase of €906.98 compared to the previous year), and 25% for income exceeding €37,163.36.<br><br>The threshold for paying income tax prepayments has doubled from €2,500 in 2019 to €5,000 in 2020. For self-employed individuals, the minimum contribution base for health and social insurance has increased to €506.50, and the maximum base for social insurance is now €7,091.

It emphasizes that selling a company is a rare and demanding event, both time-wise and psychologically.<br><br>Experts advise selling when the company is growing, profitable, and well-capitalized, not during a downturn. Common reasons for selling include lifestyle changes, retirement, lack of successors, or reinvesting capital. Crucially, sellers must ensure meticulous accounting, management reports, and market knowledge. Legal preparation is also vital to ensure swift payment and minimize seller liability for hidden debts, while buyers often prioritize non-compete clauses.<br><br>Company valuation methods include income-based (future cash flows) and asset-based (market value minus liabilities), chosen based on purpose and company type. Finding serious investors requires discretion, with platforms like ČSOB Match'it offering a secure, verified environment for connecting businesses with investors, ensuring anonymity and data protection through non-disclosure agreements and verified user access. Legal documentation, including non-disclosure agreements, letters of intent, and transaction agreements, is essential, with its complexity depending on the deal structure (share deal vs. asset deal). Both share and asset deals carry unique risks, such as undisclosed liabilities in share deals or the need for new licenses in asset deals.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full182" style="display:none;">A draft amendment to the Tax Administration Act (Tax Code) is currently undergoing interdepartmental review, proposing several significant changes. Key alterations include clarifying the definition of a taxpayer to include organizational units of associations acting in their own name, and allowing tax administrators to waive official translations of submitted documents to reduce administrative burden. New rules will govern the replacement of overlapping powers of attorney, ensuring a new one supersedes the old where conflicts arise. For electronically mandated communicators, submissions made outside the official electronic portal will require correction before being considered filed. Taxpayers will be barred from filing tax returns for periods where tax was assessed by proxy if they fail to comply with requests. Taxpayers will need to prove facts requested by tax administrators not just during audits but in all tax administration processes. Electronic delivery will be refined to target those with accessible electronic services, those requesting it, and voluntarily registered users. Tax audit reports will no longer require the reason for commencement to avoid compromising investigations based on external tips. The scope of tax audits can be expanded to include other laws, and protocol delivery will integrate the tax assessment notice. The start date for tax assessment by proxy will be the day after notification. Notifications for payment reallocations or overpayments below €5 will be discontinued for efficiency. Decisions on tax deferral or installment payments will be automatically voided if the original tax assessment is annulled. The period during which deferral or installment payments are disallowed due to non-compliance will be reduced from five to two years. Null decisions will include those issued after the right to assess tax has expired. The obligation for individuals and legal entities to report bank account numbers will be removed, as payment service providers already supply this information. Tax assessment decisions must be issued within three months of the expression of opinion on the protocol. The deadline for forwarding appeals will commence after the appeal submission period ends or upon the taxpayer’s supplementation of the appeal. Tax overpayments will be refunded to specified accounts, with provisions for cases where accounts are not provided or known. The moment of creation for a tax administrator's lien will be tied to its enforceability, with immediate notification to debtors and relevant registers. The statute of limitations for tax debt recovery will be aligned with bankruptcy law, with a ten-year extension after the annulment of debt relief. Tax execution will be suspended when a court application is filed to exclude assets until a final court decision. Electronic communication with banks will be implemented for expanded garnishments. A new tax execution method, driver's license seizure, will be introduced, excluding professional drivers. Specific times for vehicle presentation during movable property sales will be defined to prevent execution obstruction. The period for paying execution costs will start upon the delivery of the tax administrator's decision. Fines for non-compliance with non-monetary obligations will have a lowered minimum. The calculation of fines for assessments made by tax assessment orders will be defined. Fines will not be levied if a supplementary tax return reduces a previously claimed tax refund or entitlement before it has been processed.<br><br>A proposed amendment to the Tax Administration Act aims to streamline tax processes with several key changes. It clarifies taxpayer definitions, allows for waiving official translations of documents, and modifies rules for powers of attorney, ensuring new ones supersede conflicting older versions. Submissions by those required to communicate electronically must be made via the official portal or corrected. Taxpayers failing to comply with requests after tax assessment by proxy will be barred from filing subsequent returns. Taxpayers must provide evidence requested by tax administrators in all instances, not just during audits. Electronic delivery will be refined for specific user groups. Tax audit reports will no longer require the reason for commencement, and audit scope can be broadened. The process for tax assessment by proxy will have a defined start date. Notifications for minor payment reallocations or overpayments will be eliminated for efficiency. Decisions on tax deferral or installment payments will be automatically voided if the original tax assessment is annulled, with a reduced penalty period for non-compliance. Null decisions will encompass those issued after the assessment right has expired. The reporting of bank account numbers will be removed from taxpayer obligations. Tax assessment decisions will have a three-month deadline. Appeal forwarding rules will be adjusted for timeliness. Overpayments will be refunded to specified accounts. Tax administrator liens will be based on enforceability. Statute of limitations for tax debt recovery will align with bankruptcy law. Tax execution will be suspended if assets are challenged in court. Driver's license seizure will be introduced as a tax execution method. Specifics for vehicle presentation during sales and cost payment periods will be clarified. Fines for non-compliance will have lower minimums, and fines will not apply for certain corrective tax returns.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full183" style="display:none;">Does your company provide fuel cards for its subsidiaries or companies within the group? This newsletter informs you about the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union No. C-235/18 Vega International Car Transport and Logistic, in which the Court ruled that providing fuel cards by a parent company to its subsidiaries, enabling them to refuel vehicles they use for transport, can be classified as a service of granting credit, which is exempt from VAT.<br><br>For example: A parent company provides fuel cards to its subsidiaries based on an agreement with a fuel supplier. The subsidiaries use these cards to fuel vehicles owned by them. The parent company receives a monthly invoice for all fuel card transactions, claims input VAT on the fuel, and then re-invoices the fuel to its subsidiaries with a 2% markup. According to the judgment, the parent company is not entitled to deduct VAT because it doesn't have ownership rights over the fuel, like a true owner. The subsidiary directly purchases the fuel and makes all decisions regarding the purchase conditions. The re-invoicing of the fuel is not considered a sale of fuel by the parent company, as the supply of fuel was not made for the benefit of the parent company. The parent company only has an intermediary role through the fuel cards. Therefore, the parent company is providing a financial service similar to granting credit, which is VAT-exempt.</p>

      <h2>Amendments to the Value Added Tax Act</h2>
      <p class="date">14.08.2019</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary184">On June 26, 2019, the National Council of the Slovak Republic approved in the first reading a bill amending the VAT Act. The proposal suggests extending the reduced VAT rate of 10% to all foodstuffs, </p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full184" style="display:none;">On June 26, 2019, the National Council of the Slovak Republic approved in the first reading a bill amending the VAT Act. The proposal suggests extending the reduced VAT rate of 10% to all foodstuffs, excluding beverages, sweets, food additives, flavorings, nutritional supplements, and confectionery. This change, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2020.<br><br>On the same day, another bill was approved in the first reading, supplementing Annex No. 7 of the VAT Act, which defines the list of goods with a reduced tax rate. This proposal aims to introduce a reduced tax rate on newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, including those illustrated or containing advertising material. However, the reduced rate will not apply if advertising content constitutes more than 50% or erotic content exceeds 10% of the total content. This change would also take effect on January 1, 2020, if approved.<br><br>Currently, interdepartmental review is underway for a government-proposed amendment to the VAT Act, introducing several changes, including a new "CALL-OFF STOCK" regime for the supply of goods. This regime regulates the transfer of goods by a taxable person from Slovakia to another member state for subsequent delivery to a pre-known customer. Conditions include the goods being sent by the VAT payer, the payer not having a seat or establishment in the destination member state, the recipient being VAT-identified in that state, the payer recording the transfer, and including the recipient's VAT number in a summary statement. The amendment also clarifies conditions to differentiate the "CALL-OFF STOCK" regime from a standard supply of goods, particularly the requirement for the goods to be transferred to the buyer within 12 months.<br><br>Further amendments address record-keeping obligations under the "CALL-OFF STOCK" regime, summary statements, assignment of transport in EU chain transactions, VAT reduction for gratuitous transfers of assets up to EUR 1,700, changes to conditions for VAT exemption on goods supplied to the EU, correction of deducted tax on services performed on investment property, and adjustment of deducted VAT on movable investment property sold within five years of acquisition. These amendments also aim to clarify documentary evidence for VAT exemption on intra-EU supplies and consequences of incorrect summary statements.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full185" style="display:none;">The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act introduces several changes, most notably the concept of a "micro-taxpayer," defined as a physical or legal entity with income/revenue not exceeding EUR 49,790 (the VAT registration threshold). Micro-taxpayers benefit from advantageous depreciation rules for leased tangible assets, allowing them to include depreciation in tax expenses regardless of rental income. They can also freely determine the depreciation amount for assets in depreciation groups 0-4, up to the initial cost (excluding cars over EUR 48,000), but cannot interrupt depreciation. If an asset is disposed of before full depreciation, the tax base must be increased by the difference between claimed and standard depreciation.<br><br>Micro-taxpayers using double-entry bookkeeping can also deduct the creation of provisions for receivables in line with their accounting records. The amendment introduces a new depreciation group (0) for electric vehicles with a 2-year depreciation period. The loss carryforward period is extended from four to five years, limited to 50% of the tax base (except for micro-taxpayers).<br><br>Simplifications are proposed for employee tax allowances, requiring a declaration only upon employment and when conditions change. The amendment also changes rules regarding expenses deductible only upon payment, where the payment condition is not necessary if expenses are part of the asset acquisition cost. However, consultancy services and management fees will only be deductible after payment. The threshold for mandatory advance tax payments increases from EUR 2,500 to EUR 5,000. Employers' transportation contributions are tax-free up to EUR 60 monthly. The non-statute-barred status of receivables is assessed at the end of the tax period. Super deduction for R&D expenses increases to 200%. New provisions address hybrid mismatches to prevent undue tax advantages. Furthermore, income from capital funds of contributions are added to the source of income from the territory of the Slovak Republic.<br><br>The amount of meal allowance increased from 1 July 2019.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full186" style="display:none;">**Accounting Law and eKasa System in Slovakia**<br><br>The proposed amendment to the Accounting Act, effective from January 1, 2020, primarily focuses on modifying the conditions that trigger the mandatory audit of regular and extraordinary individual financial statements. The amendment suggests increasing the size criteria for audit obligation. The total assets threshold is raised from EUR 1,000,000 to EUR 2,000,000, and the net turnover threshold from EUR 2,000,000 to EUR 4,000,000. The National Council anticipates that this change will reduce the administrative burden on businesses.<br><br>The Financial Administration introduced a new system called eKasa, effective from July 1, 2019, mandating its adoption by all businesses. Traditional Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) are replaced by Online Cash Registers (OCR). The term "cash register" now encompasses not only traditional ECRs but also mobile phones, computers, tablets, or Virtual Cash Registers (VCR).<br><br>An OCR can be a traditional fiscal ECR, but it must be connected online to the Financial Administration after July 1, 2019. VCR is a service provided by the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, communicating through a terminal device and available exclusively through mobile applications and a client environment established on the Financial Directorate's website.<br><br>Online connection to the new system is mandatory for all businesses, eliminating the option of voluntary connection via VCR from July 2019. Businesses must register for the new system between April 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019.

      <h2>Trade in goods between EU member states with regard to QUICK FIXES in the Czech Republic</h2>
      <p class="date">04.06.2019</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full187" style="display:none;">The "Quick Fixes" aim to standardize VAT rules for B2B goods transactions within the EU, with the Czech Republic already implementing EU legislation into its VAT law. Significant changes in the Czech Republic will primarily affect the handling of goods under the call-off stock regime. Other changes mainly clarify existing practices.<br><br>The Quick Fixes, based on EU Directives 2018/1910 and 2018/1912, cover: call-off stock, assigning transport in chain transactions, verifying customer VAT IDs via VIES, and proving VAT exemption for intra-community supplies.<br><br>Regarding call-off stock, current Czech law has a brief paragraph interpreted by a 2004 agreement between tax advisors and the tax administration. This interpretation involves a known customer with a Czech VAT ID, with the fiction of acquisition occurring upon warehousing and subsequent withdrawals not considered taxable. The VAT due date follows standard principles. From January 1, 2020, the new legislation will require the supplier to be registered for VAT for intra-community supplies abroad, with a known Czech customer holding a VAT ID. The supplier will report the transfer in a summary report, and both parties must maintain records according to EU law. The customer declares the acquisition in their VAT return upon withdrawal, within 12 months. Violations result in the supplier conducting a taxable transfer in the Czech Republic.<br><br>For chain transactions, current Czech law lacks specific rules, leading to disputes and potential fraud. From January 1, 2020, EU rules will apply, assigning transport to the transaction between the supplier and intermediary, unless the intermediary provides their VAT ID from the dispatching member state, shifting the transport assignment to the intermediary's supply.<br><br>Verifying VAT IDs via VIES is already a substantive condition in the Czech Republic for VAT exemption on intra-community supplies. This practice will continue unchanged from January 1, 2020.<br><br>Currently, proving VAT exemption relies on Czech case law, with a purchaser's declaration serving as supporting evidence. Accepted evidence includes transport documents like CMR. High-risk deliveries, especially with supplier or customer transport, require caution. From January 1, 2020, the Czech tax administration will accept the documents listed in European legislation for proof of transport.</p>

      <h2>Austria: Tax Changes in Transportation – "Quick Fixes" for Chain Transactions Take Effect January 1, 2020</h2>
      <p class="date">04.06.2019</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary188">On December 4, 2018, the EU Council of Finance Ministers approved "quick fixes" regarding chain transactions, to be implemented within Article 36a of the VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC).</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full188" style="display:none;">On December 4, 2018, the EU Council of Finance Ministers approved "quick fixes" regarding chain transactions, to be implemented within Article 36a of the VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC). These rules do not apply to transactions with third (non-EU) countries.<br><br>A chain transaction involves multiple successive supplies with at least three parties, where goods are directly transported from the first supplier to the final customer. Only one physical movement of goods occurs, implying only one transport. Besides the supply linked to the transport, at least one other supply exists in each chain transaction, not connected to the physical movement. The new adjustments focus on intra-community chain transactions initiated by an intermediary.<br><br>Previously, VAT interpretation issues arose. Article 36a aims to provide greater legal certainty due to inconsistencies in national regulations and incomplete international or supranational rules.<br><br>The new regulation defines a chain transaction as described above. Article 36a of the VAT Directive aligns with existing Austrian methodology. Generally, transport is attributed to the party initiating it. However, the intermediary has the option to influence this attribution. If the intermediary initiates the supply, the transport is generally attributed to them. However, if the intermediary acts with a VAT ID from the country of dispatch, the transport is attributed to the supply from the intermediary to the final customer.<br><br>The new regulation only offers legal certainty when the intermediary initiates transport. Otherwise, legal interpretation remains inconsistent. If the first or last customer initiates transport, transport attribution must follow established case law. The main point of contention remains determining where the right to dispose of the goods transfers to the final customer. While Article 36a (Directive 2006/112/ES) improves legal certainty, a comprehensive regulation covering all possible chain transaction scenarios (at least within the intra-community area) would be desirable.</p>

      <p class="summary" id="summary189">The JStG 2018 law necessitates the implementation of "quick fix" measures, approved in December 2018 at the European level, into national law by January 1, 2020. These measures aim to facilitate intra</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full189" style="display:none;">The JStG 2018 law necessitates the implementation of "quick fix" measures, approved in December 2018 at the European level, into national law by January 1, 2020. These measures aim to facilitate intra-community trade until a definitive VAT system based on the destination principle is established. The quick fixes, effective from January 1, 2020, address consignment stocks and intra-community supplies.<br><br>For consignment stocks, specifically call-off-stock arrangements where a single customer withdraws goods, the new rules, according to Article 17a of the VAT Directive, state that transferring goods to another member state is not equivalent to a taxable supply if certain conditions are met. VAT is only triggered upon withdrawal from the consignment stock, eliminating the supplier's tax obligation in the destination country.<br><br>Regarding intra-community supplies, the VAT Directive now mandates that a valid VAT ID and its communication to the supplier are essential for tax exemption. Failure to submit or accurately complete summary reports (relating to VAT) can jeopardize tax exemption unless the supplier can justify the omission to the authorities. Additionally, proving an intra-community supply requires at least two non-contradictory documents from independent parties like CMR documents or freight invoices.<br><br>These changes necessitate stricter verification of customer VAT IDs, accurate summary reports, and correct invoicing procedures. While the quick fixes provide legal certainty for consignment stocks, businesses claiming VAT exemptions on intra-community supplies face increased evidentiary requirements. The hope remains that the eventual transition to a definitive VAT system will further ease the burden on businesses.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full190" style="display:none;">The European Commission approved four VAT "Quick Fixes" at the end of 2018, effective from January 1, 2020, aimed at improving cross-border trade. These fixes address: simplifying call-off stock arrangements, making VAT ID a substantive requirement for VAT exemption, establishing unified criteria for chain transactions, and standardizing proof of transport for intra-community supplies.<br><br>For call-off stock, the changes treat the transfer to a consignment warehouse in another member state for a pre-determined customer as a single supply in the dispatching state and an acquisition in the receiving state, avoiding the need for the supplier to register in the destination country. A valid VAT ID of the recipient becomes a material condition for VAT exemption on intra-community supplies. Lack of a valid VAT ID reported to the supplier disqualifies the zero VAT rate application.<br><br>For chain transactions, new rules determine which supply in the chain is linked to the transport of goods. If a intermediary supplier arranges the transport and is VAT registered in a different member state, the transport is attributed to the supply to that intermediary. Standardized proof of transport is also introduced, requiring suppliers to provide at least two pieces of evidence, such as a signed CMR document or official documents, to demonstrate that goods have moved to another member state. If the recipient organizes the transport, they must provide a written statement to the supplier confirming the transport.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full192" style="display:none;">Given the possibility of a hard Brexit, the company recommends several actions. If your company purchased goods or services from a UK VAT payer in 2019, file for a UK VAT refund well before the UK leaves the EU. Review all intra-group business agreements with the UK, like royalty payments, and assess withholding tax obligations. Scrutinize all contracts and related payments to the UK, such as leases, and evaluate the need for tax security.<br><br>Companies with existing or planned trade relations with the UK should apply for an EORI identifier from the Slovak Financial Directorate. Communicate with business partners to address potential supply chain disruptions. If registered for the VAT Mini One-Stop Shop in the UK, register in another EU member state.<br><br>Assess whether certificates, licenses, or permits issued by UK authorities will remain valid in the EU post-Brexit, particularly in sectors like automotive, healthcare, transport, broadcasting, and finance. Examine supply chains regarding rules of origin, treating UK inputs as non-originating to secure preferential EU origin for your goods. If unfamiliar with trade procedures for third countries, familiarize yourself with these practices. The company offers assistance for navigating Brexit challenges through its experienced team and UK partners.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full193" style="display:none;">The United Kingdom's departure from the EU has been a major topic at the European level for the past two years. A "hard BREXIT" would occur on October 31, 2019, if the UK didn't approve the Withdrawal Agreement or request a longer extension. Without an agreement, the exit will impact citizens, businesses, and authorities in both the UK and the EU, bringing changes to border controls, the validity of licenses, and data transfer conditions.<br><br>Slovak businesses need to prepare, especially in customs and VAT. Without a deal, customs authorities will apply third-country rules to UK trade, including customs declarations and tariffs. Companies trading regularly with the UK can apply for simplified customs procedures. Those new to UK trade require an EORI number. Post-Brexit, inputs from the UK won't count as "EU content" for preferential tariffs.<br><br>For VAT, the UK becomes a third country, impacting buying and selling goods, and VAT refunds for Slovak applicants will follow UK national legislation after Brexit. Businesses using the "MOSS" scheme must register within an EU member state, not the UK.<br><br>In international taxation, the double taxation treaty remains, but UK taxpayers are treated as third-country taxpayers. Notably, exemptions for interest and license fees under the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive will no longer apply. Tax security measures will be implemented, requiring payers to secure 19% of taxable income paid to UK residents. An example illustrates this with rental income paid to a UK property owner, where the Slovak company must secure 19% tax.</p>

      <h2>New Guideline of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic on Determining the Content of Transfer Pricing Documentation</h2>
      <p class="date">24.01.2019</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary195">In 2018, the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic (MFSR) published a new guideline (MF/019153/2018-724) on determining the content of transfer pricing documentation.<br><br>The documentation is catego</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full195" style="display:none;">In 2018, the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic (MFSR) published a new guideline (MF/019153/2018-724) on determining the content of transfer pricing documentation.<br><br>The documentation is categorized into full, basic, and abbreviated, depending on its scope. Unlike previous guidelines, the extent of documentation now depends on the type of controlled transaction (significant/insignificant, cross-border/domestic) rather than the type of taxpayer. This means different controlled transactions of the same taxpayer may require different levels of documentation.<br><br>The guideline also addresses documentation requirements for permanent establishments. There are no significant changes regarding specific transfer pricing rules for the public sector.<br><br>The guideline doesn't set a minimum value for defining a significant controlled transaction, referencing the definition of materiality in accounting law and IFRS standards. The previous minimum value of EUR 1,000,000, above which transactions had to be described in the documentation, has been removed.<br><br>A standardized form for abbreviated documentation is included in the guideline's appendix. Full or basic documentation is prepared separately for each controlled transaction or jointly for a group of transactions, with reasons for grouping provided. Documentation is kept for the relevant tax period.<br><br>This guideline applies to documentation submitted for tax periods beginning after December 31, 2017. Taxpayers can follow the 2016 guideline until June 30, 2019.<br>Controlled transaction types determine the required documentation type, with categories like significant cross-border transactions requiring full documentation, while others necessitate basic or abbreviated versions.<br><br>The new guideline significantly changes documentation requirements, particularly affecting small and medium-sized enterprises. While it sets the minimum documentation scope, tax authorities can request additional information. Taxpayers should still verify prices align with the arm's length principle to limit tax risks during audits, even if transfer pricing documentation isn't mandatory in some cases.</p>

      <h2>New Definition of Turnover for VAT Purposes</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full200" style="display:none;">The current definition of turnover uses the terms "income" and "revenue," creating unequal conditions for taxable persons using double-entry bookkeeping versus those using single-entry bookkeeping. These terms are replaced by "value of supplied goods and services," meaning turnover will include the value of supplied goods and services as per Section 22, Paragraph 1 of the VAT Act at the time of their supply.<br><br>According to the new definition in the VAT Act, even for taxable persons keeping single-entry accounts, payments received before the supply of goods or services will not be included in turnover. These received "advance payments" constitute part of the value of the goods or services and will be included in turnover for the calendar month in which the goods or services were supplied.<br><br>In conjunction with the change in definition, Section 50, Paragraph 2 (Calculation of the Coefficient) replaces the terms revenue (income) excluding tax with the terms value excluding tax of supplied goods and services.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>A new definition of turnover under the VAT Act aims to level the playing field for businesses. Previously, terms like "income" and "revenue" created disparities between double-entry and single-entry bookkeeping. The revised definition centers on the "value of supplied goods and services" at the time of supply. This clarification means advance payments received before goods or services are delivered will not be counted towards turnover until the actual supply occurs. This change also impacts the calculation of the coefficient, where "revenue (income) excluding tax" is now replaced by "value excluding tax of supplied goods and services."</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full201" style="display:none;">New VAT rules for vouchers have been established due to inconsistencies in determining the time and place of supply, tax liability, and tax base for transactions involving vouchers. A voucher is defined as a physical or electronic instrument that grants the holder the right to receive goods or services, while obligating the supplier to accept it as consideration for those goods or services.<br><br>The proposed amendment distinguishes between single-purpose and multi-purpose vouchers, based on whether the specific goods or services the voucher can be exchanged for are known in advance. This classification aims to correctly determine when tax liability arises – either upon the voucher's issuance or upon the actual supply of goods or services in exchange for it. These changes apply to vouchers issued after December 31, 2018. The rules do not cover discount vouchers, which offer a reduction on a purchase but do not grant the right to receive goods or services in exchange for the voucher itself.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full203" style="display:none;">A significant change in the VAT Act concerns the VAT regime for the supply of buildings and the rental of real estate, as well as a redefined definition of initial building approval (kolaudácia).<br><br>Currently, the supply of a building or its part, including the land it stands on, is exempt from VAT if it occurs more than five years after the initial building approval. Under the current law, VAT payers had the option to choose whether to tax the supply, but the amendment removes this discretionary power. The amendment introduces new events that trigger the five-year period during which the supply of a part of a building (apartment, non-residential space) is mandatorily subject to VAT. After this period, VAT payers must exempt the supply of residential buildings from VAT. If a residential property is sold after five years but before the period for adjusting deducted VAT (20 years), the VAT payer must adjust the VAT deducted from the property's acquisition.<br><br>The amendment also changes the rules for taxing rental properties, making VAT exemption mandatory for residential property rentals, regardless of the tenant's status. This applies to all lease agreements concluded after December 31, 2018, for properties handed over for use after that date.<br><br>Furthermore, the amendment broadens the definition of initial building approval to include not only the approval for the initial use of the building but also approvals for changes in the building's intended use and approvals for using the building after construction work significantly altering its existing use. A dividing criterion is set at 40% of the building's market value before the reconstruction, considering location and time. VAT exemption is possible five years after the kolaudácia related to the change of use or reconstruction.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The Slovak VAT Act has been amended to change the VAT rules concerning the supply and rental of real estate. Key changes include making VAT exemption mandatory for residential property rentals and supplies occurring more than five years after initial building approval (kolaudácia). The amendment removes the VAT payer's discretionary power to tax the supply of buildings after this five-year period. It also clarifies the start of this five-year period, including situations involving changes in the building's intended use or significant renovations. The definition of "kolaudácia" is expanded to encompass these changes of use or renovations if they represent at least 40% of the property's pre-renovation market value. If residential property is sold after 5 years but before 20 years(VAT adjustment period), the VAT payer must adjust the VAT deducted from the property's acquisition. These changes aim to provide clearer and more consistent VAT treatment for real estate transactions and rentals in Slovakia. The changes in rental property taxation apply to agreements from 2019 onward.</p>

If the employee spends less than €500, the employer will contribute 55% of the eligible expenses.<br><br>According to the amendment to the Income Tax Act, if the conditions specified in the Labour Code are met, the recreation contribution provided will be considered tax-exempt income for the employee and an acceptable tax-deductible expense for the employer.<br><br>A recreational voucher is a specific payment instrument issued by a limited provider, usable in the Slovak Republic by service providers who have a contractual relationship with the limited provider issuing the recreational vouchers.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full208" style="display:none;">The Slovak Republic has ratified the OECD Multilateral Convention, which facilitates the efficient and swift implementation of selected BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) measures into individual double taxation treaties. The Multilateral Convention aims to modify all double taxation treaties concluded by the Slovak Republic and will come into effect on January 1, 2019. The contracting states to which the Multilateral Convention will apply from January 1, 2019, include Australia, Austria, France, Israel, Japan, Lithuania, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, and the UK.<br><br>The text of the Multilateral Convention in both Slovak and English can be found at the provided link: https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2018/339/<br><br>This article explains the Slovak Republic's ratification of the OECD Multilateral Convention, a key instrument for implementing BEPS measures into existing double taxation agreements. The convention, effective January 1, 2019, streamlines the application of these measures across multiple treaties. It lists the initial signatory countries that will be affected by its implementation, including major economies like Australia, France, Japan, the UK, and several European nations. The primary goal is to combat tax base erosion and profit shifting, ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activities generating them are performed. The article also provides a link to access the full text of the convention in both Slovak and English.</p>

This new gross amount, however, will be significantly reduced after mandatory deductions. Income tax at 19% along with contributions to health and social insurance will lower the take-home pay. Consequently, the net minimum wage, or the amount an employee will actually receive, is estimated to be around €430 per month.

      <p class="full-content" id="full212" style="display:none;">On September 24, 2018, the French government presented the draft Finance Law for 2019, to be debated in Parliament and potentially amended before final approval by the end of 2018.<br><br>Article 13 incorporates the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) rules, focusing on limiting interest deductibility. Key changes include capping deductible "excess borrowing costs" at the higher of €3 million or 30% of adjusted taxable income (EBITDA). A safe-harbor provision allows for the deduction of 75% of excess borrowing costs exceeding the limit if the company's equity ratio equals or exceeds its consolidated group's. A new thin capitalization rule limits deductibility to the higher of 10% of EBITDA or €1 million if related-party debt exceeds 1.5 times equity.<br><br>Taxpayers can carry forward disallowed excess borrowing costs indefinitely and unused interest capacity for up to five years. These rules also apply to French tax groups under certain conditions, affecting periods starting January 1, 2019, including interest on pre-existing loans.<br><br>Article 48 introduces a general anti-abuse rule for corporate income tax, disallowing arrangements with the main purpose of obtaining a tax advantage contrary to the law's intent. This implements the ATAD's general anti-abuse rule, enabling tax authorities to challenge arrangements aimed primarily at tax benefits without needing to prove exclusive tax avoidance intent. This clause is also effective for periods beginning January 1, 2019.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full213" style="display:none;">The European Union's ATAD (Anti Tax Avoidance Directive) ensures taxes are paid where profits and value are generated. It mandates measures for Slovakia to implement to prevent aggressive tax planning and facilitate information exchange among financial intelligence units to identify suspicious transactions.<br><br>Slovak income tax law already has anti-fraud measures but introduces further rules to strengthen protection against aggressive tax planning and base erosion and profit shifting. Implementing ATAD rules amends both the income tax law and the tax administration law.<br><br>The tax administration law change stems from introducing a new exemption for the commercial use of intangible assets, requiring the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic to publish a list of taxpayers claiming this exemption.<br><br>Since January 1, 2018, Slovak income tax law has included a special tax regime for the commercial use of intangible assets, exempting income from granted and registered patents, utility models, and software. This "patent box" encourages research and development by offering more favorable taxation for its commercial results, motivating registration with the Industrial Property Office and potentially increasing employment.<br><br>To enhance tax transparency, a tax administration law amendment from January 1, 2019, expands the publication of taxpayer lists to include those related to levy obligations, specifically publishing details of financial institutions paying special levies and regulated entities. This expanded publication aims to combat tax evasion, with all lists available on the Financial Directorate's website.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full214" style="display:none;">The European Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), published in 2016, builds upon the OECD's BEPS action plan. Member states were generally required to implement ATAD by January 1, 2019, followed by the ATAD II amendment in 2017, with most of its measures effective from January 1, 2020.<br><br>Austria already had legislation addressing some ATAD measures, requiring adaptation rather than complete overhaul. Regarding deductibility of borrowing costs, Austria retained its 2014 rule, allowing interest deductions to related parties only if the corresponding interest income is taxed at a minimum corporate tax rate of 10%, extending also to intra-group license fees. It remains to be seen if Austria will adjust this to align with ATAD Article 4.<br><br>Austria's exit tax provisions for asset transfers were largely unchanged, with minor adjustments to criteria and a reduction in the installment payment period for taxes on long-term assets to five years, complying with ATAD Article 5.<br><br>Austria's existing anti-abuse provisions were similar to ATAD Article 6, leading to adjustments to the wording to match ATAD’s criteria. The practical impact of these changes remains to be seen.<br><br>Prior to ATAD Article 7, Austria lacked controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. Consequently, a CFC rule was introduced into Austrian corporate tax law, applicable to profits realized after January 1, 2019, exempting companies with passive income not exceeding one-third of their taxable income and setting a de minimis threshold for low-profit companies. The rule applies if passive income is taxed below 12.5%, potentially impacting companies in some EU member states.<br><br>Regarding hybrid mismatches, Austria already restricts deductibility of borrowing costs if the recipient's income is not taxed at a minimum of 10% and disallows tax exemptions on dividends if the dividend payment is a deductible expense for the subsidiary. These provisions have not yet been amended based on ATAD Article 9.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full215" style="display:none;">In recent years, tax law has faced strong legislative pressure, mainly from the EU and OECD, aiming to combat aggressive tax practices. One recent measure transposes Article 6 of EU Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD), establishing the principle of prohibiting abuse of law in the Czech legal system. Member states have a short time to implement these rules by December 31, 2018.<br><br>Abuse of law involves subjective (taxpayer motivation) and objective (purpose of the law) criteria. The tax administrator assesses whether abuse occurred and bears the burden of proof. The principle should be used as a last resort, not replacing standard tools like price corrections. The Czech Republic's administrative courts have addressed such cases since 2005, with rulings aligning with ATAD's key aspects.<br><br>It's crucial to distinguish abuse of law from dissimulation (where the real intention is hidden). Abuse of law involves intentionally chosen actions without concealment.<br><br>The proposed law, currently in the Chamber of Deputies, incorporates the prohibition into the Tax Code, applying to all tax types to ensure consistency. The proposed wording focuses on actions with the "prevailing purpose" of gaining a tax advantage contrary to the law's intent. The tax administrator must prove the abuse.<br><br>The law doesn't target situations where taxpayers choose a tax-efficient path allowed by law. Concerns exist that this principle could be overused by tax administrators, creating uncertainty, and impacting court decisions. The article raises the question of whether businesses should be forced to act only rationally and whether tax authorities should judge the rationality of business decisions.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full218" style="display:none;">On June 20, 2018, the National Council of the Slovak Republic approved the Insurance Tax Act, effective January 1, 2019. The new insurance tax will have a uniform eight percent rate, affecting all non-life insurance products, with the exception of mandatory contractual insurance, where the eight percent levy will remain unchanged. A change concerning informational obligations was also agreed upon. Under current legislation, clients must notify an insurance company of their intent to terminate a contract at least six weeks before the end of the insurance period. However, according to members of the finance committee, insurance companies will be required to inform clients ten weeks before the end of the insurance period about the approaching insurance expiry and the rate for the following year.<br><br>This article provides information on a new insurance tax law in Slovakia. The Act, effective from January 1, 2019, introduces an eight percent tax on non-life insurance products. Notably, mandatory contractual insurance remains subject to an eight percent levy. The legislation also mandates enhanced informational duties for insurance companies. Previously, policyholders had to give six weeks' notice for contract termination. The new regulations require insurers to inform clients ten weeks in advance about the upcoming insurance period end and the applicable rate for the subsequent year. This change aims to give policyholders more time to consider their options and make informed decisions regarding their insurance coverage.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full219" style="display:none;">The Financial Administration has prepared a project for online connection of all cash registers to the Financial Administration's eKasa portal. In practice, this means the Financial Administration will have immediate information on every transaction, as each issued receipt will be registered in the central eKasa storage. Previously, entrepreneurs had the option to voluntarily connect to the Financial Administration's systems; going forward, connection to the Financial Administration will be mandatory. Electronic registration cash registers (ERP) will become online registration cash registers (ORP). However, entrepreneurs will have more options: a cash register can be not only a classic ERP but also a tablet, mobile phone, computer, or a Virtual Registration Cash Register (VRP).<br><br>The project is expected to bring entrepreneurs reduced administrative burdens and lower costs, while buyers will benefit from increased protection against unreliable entities and, for example, electronic receipts.<br><br>The proposal, subject to approval by the National Council of the Slovak Republic, anticipates a phased implementation. The first phase, in April 2019, will connect the HORECA segment (hotels, restaurants, cafes, and gas stations). The second phase, in July 2019, will connect retail, services, and other sectors.<br><br>The Financial Administration is implementing a mandatory online connection for all cash registers to the eKasa portal. This change transforms electronic registration cash registers (ERP) into online registration cash registers (ORP), providing the Financial Administration with real-time transaction data. Entrepreneurs will have flexibility in choosing their cash register solution, including classic ERPs, tablets, mobile phones, computers, or Virtual Registration Cash Registers (VRP). This initiative aims to reduce administrative work and costs for businesses while enhancing consumer protection and offering electronic receipts. The rollout is planned in two phases: the HORECA sector in April 2019 and retail, services, and others in July 2019. The project requires parliamentary approval for implementation.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full220" style="display:none;">From July 1, 2018, mandatory electronic communication with the financial administration is extended to all natural persons who are entrepreneurs. The obligation to communicate electronically from July 1, 2018, will apply only to natural persons who are entrepreneurs, registered for income tax according to § 49a of Act no. 595/2003 Coll. on Income Tax. These are taxable entities that have income according to § 6 para. 1 and 2 of Act no. 595/2003 Coll. on Income Tax.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Starting July 1, 2018, a significant change mandates electronic communication with the financial administration for all natural persons operating as entrepreneurs. This new requirement specifically targets individuals registered for income tax under Section 49a of the Slovak Income Tax Act. The obligation is for those individuals who derive income as defined by Section 6, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the same act. This initiative aims to streamline and digitize interactions between the tax authority and the entrepreneurial segment of the population, ensuring a more efficient and paperless system for tax-related matters. The update signifies a broader adoption of digital channels for official communication within the financial administration.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full221" style="display:none;">On July 3, 2018, the OECD issued a draft amendment to the OECD Guidelines concerning financial transactions. These provisions are intended to shed more light on the valuation methods for, for example, intragroup loans, guarantees, and cash pooling. Special attention is paid to the actual substance of the transaction and the issue of hidden or inadequate capitalization. The draft amendment to the OECD Guidelines is not yet final.<br><br>How useful was this article?<br><br>Submit rating<br><br>Average rating<br><br>0<br><br>/ 5. Number of votes:<br><br>0<br><br>No votes yet! Be the first to rate this post.<br><br>On July 3, 2018, the OECD released a draft amendment to its Guidelines on financial transactions. The proposed changes aim to clarify the valuation of various financial arrangements within multinational groups, including intragroup loans, guarantees, and cash pooling. A significant focus is placed on the true economic substance of these transactions and addressing the issue of thin capitalization or hidden capital. The draft amendment is still under consideration and has not been finalized. This development is crucial for companies engaging in cross-border financial activities, as it seeks to provide clearer guidance on transfer pricing for financial instruments. The aim is to ensure that such transactions are priced appropriately, reflecting arm's length principles and preventing tax base erosion. The OECD's ongoing efforts in this area underscore the importance of accurate financial transaction valuation in international tax matters.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full224" style="display:none;">The French wealth tax, previously levied on individuals with assets over €1.3 million, which had prompted wealthy individuals to leave France, was limited to private real estate ownership from January 1, 2018, and even increased.<br><br>The new Real Estate Wealth Tax ("impôt sur la fortune immobilière" or IFI) largely adopts provisions from the old wealth tax (ISF), including the €1.3 million taxable threshold, a progressive tax rate up to 1.5%, and general valuation criteria. It now taxes both directly and indirectly held real estate more stringently, unless used for economic activity within companies. Private properties owned by companies, in which an IFI taxpayer has an interest, are considered only down to a certain participation level, with the tax base derived from company shares corresponding to directly or indirectly held real estate. Determining these values can be challenging.<br><br>This means that private individuals’ total non-operational real estate holdings are subject to IFI taxation. Other assets, such as liquid assets, movable property, securities, and business stakes, are excluded. Non-residents, who were previously taxed only on French real estate or interests in real estate companies under the old wealth tax, now face an expanded tax base under the new IFI. Loan and liability deduction rules have been significantly modified; for instance, loans from family members and related parties are generally no longer deductible, except under strict exceptions. A prohibition on deducting loans from shareholders remains. Deductions are limited if taxable assets exceed €5 million and loans constitute over 60% of these assets. The practical application of these new regulations will be closely monitored, with assistance available.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full239" style="display:none;">Sending employees abroad can simplify operating in foreign markets. While the Czech Republic doesn't require pre-assignment registration with customs or other authorities, compliance with various rules and legal restrictions is essential to avoid penalties and ensure a smooth assignment.<br><br>EU Directive 96/71/ES mandates adherence to Czech labor laws regarding work hours, rest periods, vacation time, minimum wage, overtime pay, workplace safety, and equal treatment, even when a local contract is in place. However, if the employee's home country offers more favorable terms in any of these areas, those terms apply instead. The minimum wage in the Czech Republic for unskilled professions was CZK 11,000 in 2017, increasing to CZK 12,200 in 2018, with higher guaranteed wages for more demanding roles.<br><br>For social security within the EU, employees typically remain under their home country's system for assignments up to 24 months, as per Regulation 883/2004. This affects social security and health insurance payments but doesn't restrict access to healthcare in the host country. Form A1 is required to confirm social security affiliation.<br><br>Taxation is determined by double taxation treaties, defining tax residency and potential permanent establishments. Non-residents are taxed only on Czech-sourced income, while residents are taxed on global income. If taxation occurs in the Czech Republic, income is taxed at 15%, with an additional 7% solidarity tax for annual incomes exceeding CZK 1,355,136 in 2017 (CZK 1,438,992 in 2018). The tax base includes employer-paid insurance. Employees are entitled to a CZK 24,840 annual tax credit, with specific requirements for non-residents. It is crucial to determine whether the foreign employer is obligated to withhold taxes.<br><br>For assignments from non-EU countries, double taxation treaties still apply, but social security requires verification via bilateral agreements.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full240" style="display:none;">The issue of cross-border employee posting is currently relevant due to the complexities of the host country's legal system, which impose numerous obligations in labor law, social security law, tax law, and other regulations. Significant changes to the regulation of employee posting were made in the Slovak Labor Code in June 2016. The Labor Code regulates three types of cross-border posting: posting under the direction and responsibility of the sending employer who provides services abroad to their customer; intra-group posting between a parent and subsidiary company or between sister companies; and temporary assignment (leasing) of an employee to a user employer, where the employee works under their direction.<br><br>This newsletter outlines simplified tax schemes related to these cross-border posting options for foreign employees working in Slovakia. If the activity is performed in Slovakia for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, Slovakia has the right to taxation. If less than 183 days, income from dependent activity is taxed abroad. However, providing services can create a permanent establishment risk. Exceeding 183 days requires the foreign employer/employee to register for income tax and pay advances in Slovakia. Employers often confuse posting with business trips, but business trips involve temporary tasks outside the scope of the employer's services.<br><br>For intra-group postings or temporary assignments, determining the employer's status is crucial. Tax advances are deducted in Slovakia from the first day by the "economic employer". The foreign employee's tax in Slovakia is settled through a tax return or annual reconciliation done by the economic employer. Due to the specifics of each employee posting, detailed information is available at martin.kino@bdrbb.sk.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full243" style="display:none;">**Posting and Temporary Assignment to Austria**<br><br>When an employer temporarily deploys employees to a different work location to fulfill a contractual obligation, it is considered a posting. This differs from cross-border temporary assignment, where an employer makes employees available to a third party (user employer). Regulations regarding labor law, minimum wage, reporting, residence permits, and social security must be adhered to.<br><br>Austrian labor law, including employee protection and regulations on working hours and rest periods (AZG, ARG, and collective agreements), must be observed if they are more beneficial to the posted or temporarily assigned employees than the regulations in their home country. A standard work week is 40 hours, and records of actual working hours must be maintained and readily available. Employees are entitled to at least the minimum wage stipulated by Austrian law or collective agreements.<br><br>EU/EEA/Swiss companies must report postings or temporary assignments using forms ZKO 3/4 to the Central Coordination Office for Illegal Employment Control before work begins. Companies posting third-country nationals require an EU posting certificate from the AMS, which verifies proper employment and adherence to Austrian wage and working conditions.<br><br>Third-country companies posting workers do not report to the Central Coordination Office; instead, the Austrian employer must apply for posting or employment permits. For temporary assignments from third countries, the Austrian company needs a special temporary assignment permit and subsequent employment permit from the AMS.<br><br>Third-country nationals require a visa and residence permit (if staying over six months); EU citizens need a residence certificate if staying longer than three months. Employees typically remain insured under their home country's social security system for postings/assignments up to 24 months, provided they don't replace previous workers. A1 certificates confirm existing insurance coverage.<br><br>Required documents (A1 certificate, posting report copy, wage records, and work permit, if applicable) must be available in German at the work location.

      <h2>Production Models from a Transfer Pricing Perspective</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full244" style="display:none;">Manufacturing activities within a group can be organized in four main models: full-fledged manufacturer, limited-risk manufacturer, contract manufacturer, and toll manufacturer.<br><br>A full-fledged manufacturer performs all activities from product design to sales, bearing all associated risks and owning significant intangible assets. A limited-risk manufacturer is responsible for all production phases but doesn't own intangible assets, instead licensing them.<br><br>A contract manufacturer focuses solely on production and quality control according to the principal's specifications. Production is pre-sold, and the manufacturer owns the produced goods but is not involved in design, distribution, or sales, essentially acting as a service provider.<br><br>The least risky profile is the toll manufacturer, which is similar to a contract manufacturer but doesn't own inventory or finished goods.<br><br>In transfer pricing theory and practice, the fundamental rule is that greater risks and functions performed lead to a higher expected return.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>Manufacturing can be structured through four models based on risk and responsibility. A full-fledged manufacturer handles everything from design to sales, owning intangibles and bearing full risk. Limited-risk manufacturers handle all production phase but license intangible assets. Contract manufacturers produce goods to specifications, owning them until sale but not involved in design or distribution. Toll manufacturers are similar to contract manufacturers but never own the inventory. Generally, the more risk and functions a manufacturer undertakes, the greater their expected compensation under transfer pricing principles. These different models are employed to best achieve business objectives, with the riskier models potentially offering more profit but with greater responsibility and resources required.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full246" style="display:none;">The Slovak Tax Code (Act No. 563/2009 Coll.) is expected to undergo changes aimed at increasing transparency, improving public awareness, and curbing tax evasion. The proposed amendment, effective January 1, 2018, introduces a tax reliability index to objectively assess tax subjects based on their compliance, incentivizing higher reliability with benefits and potentially special tax regimes. It also mandates electronic filing for all legal entities and income tax-registered entrepreneurs, with limited exceptions, extending this requirement to their representatives (excluding lawyers and tax advisors).<br><br>Furthermore, the amendment empowers the Financial Directorate to create comprehensive protocols on interconnected transactions of tax subjects found violating tax regulations, particularly within fraudulent chains. These protocols, derived from tax audits and on-site investigations, will provide a holistic view of participant behavior without replacing individual audit reports. Finally, the Financial Directorate will publish quarterly lists of corporate income taxpayers, including non-profit entities, detailing assessed tax, additional tax assessments, or tax losses. Lists of VAT payers with claimed or additionally claimed VAT refunds will also be published quarterly, with a minimum threshold set by the Ministry of Finance.</p>

      <h2>Amendment to the Value Added Tax Act</h2>
      <p class="date">17.08.2017</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary247">The Slovak Ministry of Finance has proposed amendments to the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act, effective January 1, 2018, to align with the European Court of Justice rulings and address application issues. </p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full247" style="display:none;">The Slovak Ministry of Finance has proposed amendments to the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act, effective January 1, 2018, to align with the European Court of Justice rulings and address application issues. Key changes include adjustments to the tax security deposit, extending the deposit requirement to entities with tax arrears exceeding €1,000 or those deregistered for repeated non-compliance. The definition of a participant in a triangular transaction is refined to focus on the absence of a registered office or fixed establishment in the second customer's member state. A specific VAT liability is introduced for assignees using special arrangements, triggering tax liability upon assignment with a corresponding deduction right for the customer.<br><br>The proposed changes also abolish the €5,000 threshold for reverse charge on grains and metals, extending it to all supplies of these commodities. A summary invoice for electricity, gas, water, and heat can now be issued to foreign taxable persons for periods up to 12 months. Faster refunds of excess deductions are proposed based on control statement data, even before a tax audit. Those registered for tax under specific sections will be required to submit a summary statement if they participate in a triangular transaction as the first customer. Finally, VAT deducted from payments must be returned in the last tax period if the goods or services were not delivered by the date of deregistration.</p>

      <h2>Proposed Amendment to the Income Tax Act</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full248" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic is proposing an amendment to the Income Tax Act to combat tax fraud, aggressive tax planning, and base erosion and profit shifting. The changes align with the Slovak government's program statement, legislative plan for 2017, and the EU's Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), which Slovakia must implement by December 31, 2018, with certain exceptions effective from January 1, 2019, and a one-year extension for transfer pricing rules.<br><br>The amendment affects laws on banks, housing loans, and tax administration. Key changes include a new debt relief mechanism via bankruptcy or payment schedule, providing tax-free income for discharged debts and deductible allowances for claims against debtors with court-ordered payment schedules. A tax bonus on mortgage interest payments is proposed, capped at €50,000 per property. Support for domestic spa care and tourism is included, introducing a non-taxable portion of income for spa-related expenses (food, accommodation, procedures) up to €50 per taxpayer, spouse, and dependent child, claimable by only one of them.<br><br>A special tax regime for commercial use of intangible assets, such as patents and software developed in Slovakia, offers a 50% tax exemption on royalties. Additionally, a 50% exemption is proposed for embedded royalties from the sale of products using registered intellectual property, after deducting direct and indirect costs and a market-based markup. The amendment also clarifies the taxation of profit shares for partners in public trading and limited partnerships with stakes in limited liability companies or cooperatives. Non-cash contributions will be valued at fair market value. An "exit tax" ensures taxation of unrealized capital gains when assets or tax residency move abroad, with a 21% rate and possible installment payments. A new non-deductible expense rule targets double deduction situations between related parties, and the deadline for remitting withholding tax for apartment owners is extended. Most provisions take effect on January 1, 2018, with some on January 1, 2019.</p>

All entities affected by the regulation must revise their information systems and data handling procedures. While some GDPR mechanisms are familiar, new obligations are introduced, particularly for intermediaries who will play a more active role in data protection.<br><br>GDPR strengthens citizens' rights and introduces the principle of accountability, requiring data controllers and processors, regardless of size, to implement technical, organizational, and procedural measures to demonstrate compliance.<br><br>The changes include significantly stricter penalties for non-compliance, potentially reaching €20 million or 4% of a company's global annual turnover, whichever is higher. The exact penalty will depend on factors such as the nature, severity, and duration of the violation, the number of affected citizens, the extent of the damage, and the measures taken to mitigate the damage. The GDPR is a pressing issue, and expert advice is available to ensure companies are prepared for the upcoming changes.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full250" style="display:none;">From July 2017, the Slovak Financial Administration began monitoring illegal online gambling, targeting websites that do not comply with Slovak legislation regarding gambling. Specifically, it focuses on entities operating online gambling games without a valid license issued by the Slovak Ministry of Finance, offering prohibited services. These entities will be published on a list of banned websites maintained by the Financial Administration, updated weekly from July 17, 2017. The Financial Administration will request court orders to block these websites and incoming payments to the accounts of illegal gambling providers.<br><br>Operating prohibited services can result in fines of up to €500,000. The main reasons for combating illegal online gambling are tax evasion and protecting minors from gambling. However, experts predict a difficult and potentially impossible battle for the Financial Administration against illegal online gambling. A list of banned websites is available.<br><br>The Financial Administration is taking action against illegal online gambling to tackle tax evasion, protect minors, and enforce gambling laws. Websites operating without a valid Slovak license will be blacklisted, and legal action will be pursued to block access and payments. This initiative aims to curb prohibited online gambling services, which are subject to substantial fines. Despite these efforts, experts anticipate significant challenges in effectively combating illegal online gambling activities. The Financial Administration will maintain a publicly accessible list of banned websites for monitoring compliance.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full256" style="display:none;">The text discusses VAT registration and obligations for e-shop operators in Slovakia, both domestic and foreign. A Slovak e-shop must register for VAT if its turnover exceeds €49,790 in 12 months. Registration is also required before receiving services from foreign entities, purchasing goods from other EU states exceeding €14,000 annually, or supplying services to other EU states where the recipient pays the tax. Foreign e-shops must register in Slovakia if their mail-order sales exceed €35,000 annually.<br><br>The text also covers tax returns, control reports, summary reports, and the point at which tax liability arises. For domestic sales, this is typically the day of delivery or payment.

      <h2>Czech Republic: Tax Implications of Operating an E-shop in Relation to VAT</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full257" style="display:none;">Selling goods through an e-shop is a popular form of commerce with no special VAT adjustments. However, certain specifics must be considered. Here’s an overview of three key VAT-related areas for operating an e-shop in the Czech Republic.<br><br>First, VAT registration and regime. Czech-based e-shops selling to non-businesses in the Czech Republic and EU must consider VAT registration based on their turnover. Registration is mandatory when exceeding CZK 1 million in domestic supplies within 12 months, or voluntary. After registering, the e-shop is obligated to pay VAT on domestic sales and can deduct VAT on purchases. "Identification for VAT" is mandatory if purchases from EU exceed CZK 326,000 or if service received from EU suppliers. Identified persons must pay VAT on EU purchases and received services, but they cannot deduct VAT.<br><br>Second, the place of taxable supply determines where VAT is applied. Sales within the Czech Republic are subject to Czech VAT rules. For goods sent to non-business EU customers, the "dispatch of goods to the EU" regime applies. If goods are sent to EU countries, the limit of sales is tracked for each country of delivery and if such a limit is exceeded registration for VAT is required in such country.<br><br>Third, electronic sales records (EET) are mandatory in the Czech Republic since March 1, 2017, for all cash and card payments, or other cashless transfers. Czech e-shops must record all sales, including international transactions. Sales should be registered no later than when the transaction is completed, but earlier registration is allowed. Even sales returns must be reported according to EET. Due to cross-border e-commerce, it is recommended to follow the legal regulations in countries which the e-shop usually conducts trade with.</p>

      <h2>Austria: Electronically Provided Services – Facilitating Compliance with Tax Obligations</h2>
      <p class="date">01.06.2017</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full258" style="display:none;">If a provider of broadcasting, telecommunications, and electronically supplied services registers for the Mini-One-Stop-Shop (MOSS), they avoid the cumbersome requirement of registering for VAT in each EU member state where their end customers are located.<br><br>Since January 1, 2015, VAT on telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronic services supplied to non-business customers within the EU is taxed in the member state where the customer is established. This legislative change aimed for fairer tax distribution by taxing at the point of consumption and removing competitive advantages previously held by providers in EU member states with lower VAT rates.<br><br>MOSS allows service providers to register for VAT in only one member state, declaring and paying VAT for all services within this special scheme through that state's tax portal, instead of registering in every member state where services are provided. However, if a provider offers other services besides those covered by MOSS, they must register for VAT in the respective member state.<br><br>In Austria, registration via FinanzOnline requires a valid VAT ID, timely application, and no existing registration block. Austrian-based providers, or those from third countries with a permanent establishment in Austria, can register. Providers without a presence in the EU can also choose Austria as their member state of identification. The tax period is a calendar quarter, and returns must be filed by the 20th of the following month.<br><br>MOSS facilitates the declaration and payment of VAT for services provided to non-business customers in member states where the provider lacks a business or establishment. The VAT return includes the VAT ID, total value of services provided under MOSS, VAT rate, and the tax due, broken down by member state, all in Euros. A nil return is required even if no services were provided during the tax period. Note that if services are sold through a platform (e.g., Appstore) where the platform operator is considered the service provider to the end customer, the operator is liable for VAT.</p>

      <h2>Germany: Risk Cases and Special Features in Intra-Community Dispatch of Goods</h2>
      <p class="date">01.06.2017</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full259" style="display:none;">More and more entrepreneurs are leveraging online opportunities to increase revenue through their own e-shops. If this leads to sales and goods are shipped to other EU member states, certain peculiarities must be observed. The risk of filing incorrect VAT returns and reports, both domestically and abroad, can ultimately lead to significant negative criminal and tax consequences.<br><br>In principle, the taxation principle based on the country of origin applies (VAT is declared where the shipment begins), so a German distributor declares their deliveries with German VAT. However, if goods are supplied to a specific group of customers in other EU member states, the basic rule of taxation according to the country of origin does not apply. In that case, the taxation principle based on the country of destination applies, and the German distributor declares the goods with the VAT of the respective EU country and remits the tax in that member state.<br><br>The regulation for mail-order sales is intended to prevent unequal competitive conditions within the European Union. If the country-of-origin principle applied without limitation, consumers would be incentivized to order goods in EU countries with the lowest VAT rates. Equal competitive conditions and VAT revenues within the European Union would be at risk.<br><br>To determine whether the basic rule for mail-order sales applies, domestic distributors must know the customer type and destination country for each transaction made through their sales platform. Their merchandise management systems and/or sales platforms should allow for the input of this information.<br><br>If the customer is a business located in another member state receiving the delivery for their business, it is generally an intra-community tax-exempt supply. The necessary documentation can be fulfilled by providing the customer's VAT registration number in the online order. The German distributor then issues a tax invoice without VAT and includes the taxable supply in its summary report.<br><br>The basic rule for mail-order sales can only be applied to a specific group of businesses in the EU if their received deliveries for one year do not exceed a certain turnover threshold, the application of the turnover threshold has not been waived, and the German distributor's deliveries to that EU state for one year have not exceeded the mail-order sales threshold.<br><br>For deliveries to private individuals in another EU member state, the VAT that the German mail-order company must declare and remit depends on the extent of deliveries to that country of destination within one year. If the goods are initially declared with German VAT, the first delivery exceeding the mail-order sales threshold in the respective EU state leads to declaration with the VAT applicable in that EU state. All subsequent supplies are then taxed at the VAT rate applicable in the country of destination. If the distributor fails to do so, there is a risk of having to pay VAT multiple times.<br><br>The VAT threshold and the mail-order sales threshold values are not uniform across Europe and vary considerably in some cases.<br><br>Businesses can voluntarily opt to tax sales based on the destination of the goods, even if the sales threshold hasn't been met, but must continue this practice until the end of the calendar year following the one in which they made the decision.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>The increasing use of e-shops by entrepreneurs necessitates careful attention to VAT regulations when shipping goods to other EU member states. The principle of taxation shifts from the country of origin to the country of destination once specific sales thresholds are met for particular customer groups or countries. Understanding customer types and destination countries is critical for determining VAT obligations. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties and tax liabilities. Special rules apply to businesses with sales below certain turnover limits and to private individuals. The VAT and mail-order thresholds vary across EU member states, requiring careful monitoring and currency exchange rate tracking. Businesses can also choose to apply destination-based taxation voluntarily, even if thresholds aren't met, but must continue doing so for a minimum duration.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full260" style="display:none;">On January 28, 2016, Slovakia joined thirty other countries in signing the Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting agreement, a key element of the OECD's action plan on transfer pricing. CbC reporting applies to large multinational groups with consolidated annual revenue exceeding €750 million. These groups are required to annually report information to the relevant financial authorities in each member state. These authorities will then automatically exchange data on the global allocation of income, profits, capital, employees, assets, and taxes paid. The aim of CbC reporting is to help tax authorities detect inaccuracies in multinational companies' pricing and associated tax evasion.<br><br>The Slovakian Parliament approved the law on international assistance and cooperation in tax administration on February 1, 2017, effective from March 1, 2017, implying the rules apply to the 2016 tax year. This regulation affects every member of a multinational group, including branches and permanent establishments, with consolidated revenues surpassing €750 million. This includes an obligation to report the identity of the reporting entity. The deadline for submitting the CbC report is 12 months from the last day of the multinational group's reporting financial year, first applicable for the financial year 2016 for parent entities. The deadline for submitting the notification is the last day for filing the income tax return for the reporting financial year. Failure to submit the CbC report can result in a fine of up to €10,000, and failure to comply with the notification obligation can incur a fine of up to €3,000.</p>

The payment condition outlined in § 17 para. 19 b) now applies not only to the rental of movable and immovable property but also to payments for the granting of the right to use, or for the use of: industrial property, computer programs (software), designs and models, plans, production-technical and other economically usable knowledge (know-how), and payments for the granting of the right to use copyright or rights related to copyright.<br><br>This change is applicable when filing tax returns after December 31, 2016, including the tax return for the 2016 tax period. The Financial Administration emphasizes that income from rent is assessed for the lessor, and related expenses are also assessed for the lessee. If payments in the lease agreement are agreed upon separately for rent and for services related to rent, including utilities, and the lessee pays them to the lessor, all these payments are considered rental income for the lessor. On the lessee's side, all these expenses are considered part of the tax base only after payment, even if the lessee records them on other cost accounts.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full262" style="display:none;">Changes are coming to the FATCA (Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act) regulations, a US law designed to prevent tax evasion by US citizens and residents using foreign financial accounts.<br><br>Since 2015, FATCA has ensured the automatic exchange of financial account information between the Slovak Financial Administration and the US tax authorities for tax administration purposes. It requires financial institutions (banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds) to provide the Slovak Financial Administration with information on the financial accounts of US citizens and residents by June 30, 2017, for the year 2016. The Slovak Financial Administration then transmits this information to the US tax authorities by September 30, 2017.<br><br>The change this year concerns the submission of information to the Slovak Financial Administration. From January, a new form will be exclusively used for new submissions in 2017 and for correcting incorrect submissions from 2016. The current form will become invalid, and new elements will be added to the updated form.<br><br>Failure to comply with FATCA obligations under Act No. 359/2015 Coll. can result in a fine of up to €10,000 for the financial institution.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The FATCA regulations, aimed at preventing US tax evasion through foreign accounts, are undergoing changes. Since 2015, FATCA has facilitated the automatic exchange of financial information between Slovak and US tax authorities. Financial institutions must report US citizens' and residents' financial accounts to the Slovak Financial Administration, which then relays the data to the US. A key change involves a mandatory new form for all 2017 submissions and corrections to 2016 filings, rendering the old form obsolete. Non-compliance can lead to fines up to €10,000. This update ensures more accurate and standardized reporting of financial data to combat tax evasion and maintain international cooperation in tax administration.

      <p class="full-content" id="full263" style="display:none;">Attention legal entities paying income tax advances!<br><br>Due to an amendment in the income tax law reducing the corporate income tax rate from 22% to 21%, adjustments are needed in calculating tax advances paid from January 1, 2017, until the deadline for filing the 2016 tax return (March 31, 2017, or extended deadline). The law mandates using the tax rate applicable in the tax period for which the advances are paid (21% for 2017).<br><br>The calculation of tax advances is based on the last known tax liability from the 2015 tax period. Therefore, the tax amount from line 1110 of the 2015 tax return needs to be recalculated using the current 21% tax rate for 2017. This recalculated amount should then be divided into 4 or 12 equal installments, depending on whether you are a quarterly or monthly payer, respectively. This determines the amount of tax advances you will pay at the current tax rate until filing the 2016 tax return, with payments due at the end of the corresponding month or quarter. According to the guide for filling out the corporate income tax return, the 21% tax rate should be used for calculating tax advances for the tax period starting January 1, 2017.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Legal entities paying income tax advances must adjust their calculations due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 22% to 21%. For advances paid from January 1, 2017, until the 2016 tax return deadline, the tax amount from line 1110 of the 2015 return must be recalculated using the 21% rate. The resulting amount is then divided into quarterly or monthly installments based on the payment frequency. These adjusted advance payments are due until the 2016 tax return is filed. The new tax rate should be taken into account when calculating tax advances. The calculation formula provided in the corporate income tax return guide should be followed, utilizing the new 21% tax rate. Failure to update calculations may result in incorrect tax advance payments.</p>

This is due to changes in how authors' income (royalties, artistic performances) is taxed since January 1, 2016. Income is primarily subject to withholding tax. However, authors and payers could agree in writing that withholding tax would not be applied. If such an agreement was made, the payer is obligated to inform the tax administrator by the stated deadline. The change allows authors some control over how their royalties are taxed, offering an alternative to standard withholding tax if a written agreement is in place. Failure to notify the tax authority of the "no withholding tax" agreement constitutes a breach of tax regulation and, can be subjected to a fine by tax authority.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full270" style="display:none;">The provided text outlines changes to the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act in Slovakia, effective from 2017. Key changes include adjustments regarding VAT deductions for foreign taxable persons, prioritizing VAT refunds over deductions except in specific cases like reverse charge scenarios. There's a shortened timeframe for returning VAT refunds on vehicles with diplomatic license plates if destroyed or sold within six months. A legal "fiction" is introduced for construction work VAT liability, shifting responsibility to the recipient if the invoice indicates "reverse charge." Suppliers using reverse charge in the construction sector must report these invoices in a control statement, even if not reported on the tax return. The act introduces compensation (interest) for excessive VAT refund delays exceeding six months due to tax audits, initiated ex officio by the tax office, unless the delay is due to the taxpayer. Finally, the effective date of self-assessment for imports from third countries has been postponed, dependent on Slovakia's public debt levels relative to EU limits, applying from January of the second calendar year following the Eurostat's publication.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full271" style="display:none;">This newsletter details changes to the Income Tax Act effective from January 1, 2017, in Slovakia.<br><br>Key updates include modifications to dividend taxation. Dividends from profits earned before 2004 are taxed at 7%. Those from 2004-2016 remain untaxed but are subject to health insurance contributions based on the rules of the respective years. Dividends from profits earned from 2017 onwards are taxed at 7% and are not subject to health insurance contributions. Dividends paid to or received from non-treaty countries are taxed at 35%. Specific rules apply based on double taxation treaties. Dividends to employees without equity participation are treated as dependent activity income.<br><br>The corporate income tax rate decreases from 22% to 21%. Tax licenses are abolished after 2017 (or the fiscal year ending in 2018). Lump-sum expenses increase to 60% of business income, up to €20,000.<br><br>Transfer pricing rules are amended, including adjustments to the tax base and new regulations for primary and corresponding adjustments, especially for taxpayers benefiting from tax relief. Fixed fees are introduced for approving pricing methods (€10,000 for unilateral, €30,000 for bilateral). A new section 18a aims to penalize intentional tax evasion through transfer pricing, with potential double penalties.<br><br>Other changes include clarifying the definition of rent included in the tax base, stricter tax treatment of demonstration vehicles, and the introduction of tax deductibility for humanitarian aid and mandatory contributions for crisis resolution on the financial market.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full272" style="display:none;">Erosion of the corporate income tax base is a critical issue addressed by the G20, G8, and EU countries. The G20 and OECD developed the BEPS Action Plan to combat base erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies to low-tax countries. Member states are expected to implement BEPS measures into their legislation.<br><br>Slovakia has already implemented a 25% super deduction for research and development expenses into its domestic laws. Actions 8-10, concerning transfer pricing and aligning it with economic activity, have been adopted, focusing on the arm's length principle and intangible assets. The revised guidance on intangible assets emphasizes distinguishing between legal and economic ownership and comparing additional factors during comparability analysis.<br><br>Action 13, Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting, was signed by Slovakia in 2016. It applies to large multinational groups with consolidated annual revenue exceeding 750 million euros, requiring them to report information to relevant financial authorities annually. These authorities then automatically exchange information on global allocation of income, profits, capital, employees, assets, and taxes paid, facilitating the detection of pricing inaccuracies and tax avoidance.<br><br>Action 14 aims to improve dispute resolution mechanisms related to double taxation treaties, including arbitration provisions. Slovakia aims to renegotiate its treaties to meet current requirements.<br><br>Action 15 involves a Multilateral Instrument (MLI), joined by 94 countries, which efficiently renegotiates existing bilateral tax treaties. The MLI can modify treaty articles related to hybrid instruments, treaty abuse, artificial avoidance of permanent establishments, and effective dispute resolution. Slovakia plans to join the MLI.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full275" style="display:none;">We would like to inform you about the Austrian Transfer Pricing Documentation Act (TPDA), which came into effect in October 2016. This law expands the regulations for multinational corporations for tax periods beginning after January 1, 2016. If certain conditions are met, particularly turnover thresholds, these new obligations apply.<br><br>The TPDA, in line with OECD requirements, establishes a three-part documentation structure: a Master File, a Local File, and a Country-by-Country Report (CbCR). The Master File describes the entire group of companies and its global economic activities and transfer pricing policies. The Local File contains information about specific economic transactions of the domestic entity. The CbCR provides information on the global distribution of income, tax obligations, and economic activities within a specific multinational group, including a list of the multinational group's companies.<br><br>The extent of required documentation depends on turnover. Master and Local Files are mandatory if revenues in the last two preceding periods exceeded EUR 50 million according to Austrian accounting standards. A CbCR is required if the group's turnover reached at least EUR 750 million in the previous year according to the consolidated profit and loss statement. The ultimate parent company prepares the report, though this responsibility can be transferred to another Austrian subsidiary under certain conditions.<br><br>Master and Local Files must be submitted to the tax authority within 30 days upon request. The CbCR must be filed electronically within 12 months after the end of the relevant reporting year, without prior notice from the tax office.<br><br>Failure to file the CbCR on time, or filing it incompletely or incorrectly, constitutes a financial crime and is punishable by a fine of up to EUR 50,000, imposed by the Financial Criminal Office. The Master File includes information on the organizational structure of the multinational group and a description of its economic activities. The Local File describes the specific domestic business company, including its management structure, economic activities, strategy, and main competitors.</p>

      <h2>Minimum income tax in CIT: analysis of methods for calculating the tax base and strategic recommendations for taxpayers</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full311" style="display:none;">The minimal income tax in CIT (Corporate Income Tax) is a new tax obligation effective from the beginning of 2024 in Poland. Companies must strategically choose between the classic or simplified method of calculating the tax base. The classic method calculates the tax base by adding 1.5% of revenues, debt financing costs to related entities exceeding 30% of EBITDA, and costs of acquiring intangible services from related entities or tax havens exceeding 3 million PLN plus 5% of EBITDA. The simplified method sets the tax base at 3% of revenues. The choice depends on the cost structure, profitability, and tax risks.<br><br>The classic method allows for the consideration of actual operating costs and is preferable for entities with high EBITDA and low intra-group transaction costs, but is complex and prone to transfer pricing errors. The simplified method is straightforward and attractive for low-profitability entities with substantial intangible costs but doesn't allow for real operating cost deductions. Deductions from the tax base include reliefs specified in Article 18 of the CIT Act, income exempt from operations in PSI/SSE, and income excluded under Article 24ca para. 2.<br><br>The tax is declared and paid by the end of the third month following the tax year's end, and any overpayment can be deducted over the next three years. Taxpayers achieving a profitability rate above 2% in 2024 may be exempt from the minimum tax for 2025-2027. Businesses with significant intra-group costs or low profitability should consider the simplified method, while those with high EBITDA and transparent related-party transactions may benefit from the classic approach. The minimum tax requires careful cost policy and transfer pricing verification.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full312" style="display:none;">This article discusses the tax implications of a loan granted by a shareholder to a capital company, specifically focusing on whether it should be subject to the tax on civil law transactions (PCC) or value-added tax (VAT).<br><br>Generally, loan agreements are subject to PCC at a rate of 0.5% of the loan amount. However, the PCC law exempts loans granted by a shareholder to a capital company, provided the shareholder is not conducting business activities. Tax authorities maintain that if the shareholder is also an entrepreneur, the loan is subject to VAT as a paid service, regardless of whether the shareholder's business is related to lending.<br><br>Administrative courts, however, offer a different perspective. They argue that if the shareholder grants the loan within the scope of their business activity, it's subject to VAT. If the shareholder isn't involved in financial activities and the loan is incidental, it should be subject to PCC. Regardless, VAT law provides an exemption for services related to granting loans. Therefore, a VAT-registered shareholder providing a loan to a capital company may not be obligated to pay VAT.</p>

      <h2>Estonian CIT and MDR: Where does tax planning end and a scheme begin?</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full313" style="display:none;">Estonian CIT and MDR raise concerns among entrepreneurs planning restructuring. The key question is where legal tax planning ends and the obligation to report a scheme begins. The Estonian CIT is intended to promote investment, development, and capital accumulation, not just optimization. Reorganizations preceding the adoption of Estonian CIT can trigger MDR reporting obligations if they primarily aim for tax benefits rather than business reasons.<br><br>The "main benefit test" in MDR is met if the primary goal is to obtain a tax advantage, outweighing economic objectives. The existence of an "alternative route" to achieve the same economic effect with less tax advantage also indicates the main benefit test is met. The Head of the National Fiscal Administration (Szef KAS) may deem actions artificial if a simpler, more tax-neutral approach was available but not chosen.<br><br>A favorable ruling example involved a reorganization with property acquisition, division, and new operating companies, deemed acceptable due to prevailing economic goals. Conversely, a negative ruling cited artificial transactions lacking business purpose, aimed at circumventing CIT regulations, leading to potential GAAR application. Actions must have economic sense. MDR reporting is required when the reorganization leads to significant tax benefits, lacks justification in actual business activity, and meets scheme hallmarks. Transparent documentation and a balance between tax and economic motivation are crucial. Estonian CIT is for investing firms, not aggressive optimizers. If tax deferral or avoidance is the main benefit, MDR or GAAR risks arise.</p>

As these companies grow, they must transition from simplified management and accounting to more professional methods. Audits should go beyond formal evaluations, providing insights for managerial decisions.<br><br>A well-conducted audit, especially by auditors experienced with similar-sized firms, helps owners and managers understand the importance of aligning accounting policies with their operational scale, impacting management quality and providing investors with reliable decision-making foundations. Many medium-sized firms focus solely on tax accounting, leading to inaccurate financial assessments. A proactively managed balance sheet policy is essential for comprehensive reporting and effective management. Auditors play a crucial role in discussing, implementing, and monitoring appropriate presentation and valuation options.<br><br>Direct auditor contact is vital. Many medium-sized companies seeking new auditors cite difficulty reaching the lead auditor and high team turnover as problems. Consistent audit teams and direct contact with the lead auditor are essential for trust, continuous communication, and a deeper understanding of the company's operations, enabling proactive responses to changing circumstances and advisory support. Modern tools shorten audit times and precisely identify risks. Audits should assess more than just financial data.<br><br>One audit uncovered cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a manufacturing firm, which were addressed before causing significant losses. Tailored audits are investments in the future, with auditors understanding business realities and identifying risks to inform decisions. Combining efficiency, timeliness, team stability, and modern tools ensures audits provide real support and secure the company's future.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full316" style="display:none;">The implementation of customs policies and their impact on global trade, particularly focusing on the changes initiated by the new American administration, significantly affect transfer pricing strategies for multinational companies. Transfer pricing, which refers to the pricing of transactions between related entities, is heavily influenced by changes in tariff policies. Increased protectionism and the use of tariffs can force businesses to adjust their transfer pricing strategies to mitigate tax burdens and maintain competitiveness.<br><br>Companies may need to modify supply chains, adjust intercompany margins, revise pricing agreements, and re-evaluate their transfer pricing policies to optimize tax and customs obligations while adhering to international regulations. This includes analyzing new risks, updating benchmarking analyses, relocating production, and reassessing transaction profitability. US tariff changes can alter transaction models and pricing policies, requiring a thorough understanding of potential consequences to stay competitive and optimize costs. Polish tax authorities will scrutinize potential transfer pricing adjustments related to these tariffs to ensure they meet market criteria.<br><br>European businesses face challenges necessitating revisions of existing transfer pricing policies and methods, potentially leading to the creation of new transfer pricing models. Moore Polska Tax & Legal offers support in navigating these transfer pricing aspects to ensure compliance and optimization in 2025, helping companies minimize tax burdens and adapt pricing policies to new regulations.</p>

      <h2>MDR – Main Benefit Criterion as a Condition of a Tax Scheme</h2>
      <p class="date">13.03.2025</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full319" style="display:none;">The Polish Tax Ordinance defines three types of tax schemes subject to mandatory reporting to the Head of the National Fiscal Administration (KAS): tax schemes, standardized tax schemes, and cross-border tax schemes. A tax scheme is defined when one of the following occurs: the arrangement meets the main benefit test and possesses a general distinguishing feature (both must be met); the arrangement possesses a specific distinguishing feature (the main benefit test is not required); or the arrangement possesses another specific distinguishing feature (the main benefit test is also not required).<br><br>The main benefit test is met if, based on existing circumstances, a reasonable entity, guided by lawful objectives other than achieving a tax benefit, could have reasonably chosen an alternative course of action that would not result in the reasonably expected tax benefit from the arrangement. The tax benefit must be the main or one of the main benefits expected from the arrangement. A tax benefit includes non-creation, deferral, or reduction of tax liability, creation or overstatement of tax loss, creation of overpayment or right to tax refund, overstatement of overpayment or refund amount, and avoidance of tax collection by a payer.<br><br>The main benefit test is assessed considering whether a tax benefit exists, whether it is a primary motivator for the arrangement, and whether there was an alternative, reasonable course of action without the tax benefit. The explanation clarifies that utilizing legally provided tax reliefs and preferences generally does not trigger reporting obligations, unless the primary motivation is tax avoidance and an alternative route exists. Examples include economically justified expenses as costs of revenue. However, artificial arrangements like B2B employment without economic justification or contract splitting to utilize lower tax rates may meet the main benefit test. The analysis should objectively compare the taxpayer's situation before and after the arrangement, considering whether a rational entity would engage in the arrangement absent the expected tax benefit. The Minister of Finance confirmed the same.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full338" style="display:none;">This article analyzes the taxation of income from contributions in kind (aport) to a company by an individual partner, particularly when a portion of the aport is allocated to the reserve capital. An aport is any non-monetary contribution with an assessable asset value that increases the company's economic potential.<br><br>According to the Personal Income Tax Act, contributions in kind to cover or increase share capital are considered income from capital for the partner, based on the value stated in the company's articles of association or similar document. If the stated value is lower than the market value, the market value of the aport is considered income. Some interpretations suggest that allocating a portion of the aport to the reserve capital doesn't change the tax implications, as the entire market value is still considered income.<br><br>However, another viewpoint presented in tax rulings treats the contribution in kind as a form of compensated disposal of assets. It states that in order for the aport to be treated as a compensated disposal, the partner needs to receive shares or stocks from the company.<br>The taxation of aport, especially when part of it is allocated to reserve capital, is not clearly defined in tax laws or precedents.<br>A compelling argument to consider only the aport value allocated to the company's share capital as income stems from Article 30b(1)(1) of the PIT Act, which specifies a 19% tax on income from acquiring shares or stocks in exchange for a contribution in kind.</p>

      <h2>Donation to a municipality – can it be deducted from income in 2024?</h2>
      <p class="date">20.12.2024</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full339" style="display:none;">Many entrepreneurs in 2024 donated to municipalities affected by the September floods. The question is whether these entrepreneurs can deduct such donations from their income.<br><br>According to CIT regulations, the tax base can be reduced by donations made for purposes outlined in the Public Benefit and Volunteer Work Act, specifically aiding victims of disasters, natural disasters, armed conflicts, and wars, both domestically and abroad. However, these donations must be given to organizations mentioned in the act, which includes non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as foundations and associations, but not entities within the public finance sector.<br><br>Municipalities, being units of local government, are classified as entities within the public finance sector according to the Act on Public Finances. Tax authorities state that a donation is deductible only if it serves the purposes mentioned in the Public Benefit and Volunteer Work Act and is given to an NGO, which excludes entities in the public finance sector.<br><br>A proposed amendment in September 2024 suggested allowing deductions for donations to local government units (LGUs) for flood victims, but this proposal was not enacted. Therefore, currently, deducting donations made to municipalities is not possible under existing tax laws.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>Entrepreneurs who donated to municipalities after the September 2024 floods cannot deduct these donations from their taxable income. Tax regulations allow deductions only for donations to NGOs, not to entities within the public finance sector. Municipalities are classified as part of the public finance sector. The donation must serve purposes outlined in the Public Benefit and Volunteer Work Act, such as aiding disaster victims. While a proposed amendment to allow deductions for donations to LGUs was considered, it was ultimately not implemented. Thus, current tax law does not permit deducting donations made directly to municipalities, despite the charitable intent, limiting tax relief to donations made to qualified NGOs instead.</p>

      <p class="summary" id="summary340">Poland has implemented the global minimum tax law, effective January 1, 2025, to align with the OECD's Pillar II and EU Directive 2022/2523. This tax targets multinational and large domestic groups wi</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full340" style="display:none;">Poland has implemented the global minimum tax law, effective January 1, 2025, to align with the OECD's Pillar II and EU Directive 2022/2523. This tax targets multinational and large domestic groups with consolidated annual revenues exceeding €750 million in at least two of the four preceding fiscal years. The goal is to ensure fair taxation where businesses operate, curbing profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions.<br><br>The law introduces three types of top-up tax: Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT), and Undertaxed Profit Rule (UTPR). IIR applies to parent entities, QDMTT is collected in countries where low-taxed constituent entities are located, and UTPR applies where the parent entity operates in a jurisdiction without IIR or QDMTT.<br><br>Exemptions include governmental entities, international organizations, non-profits, pension funds, and investment funds. Tax incentives like Special Economic Zones, Polish Investment Zones, IP BOX, and the 9% CIT rate may significantly affect the top-up tax amount. While the regulations are implemented with a delay compared to some countries, Polish subsidiaries of international groups from countries that have already implemented Pillar 2 will be subject to a review of their effective tax rate for 2024. Companies should prepare for these changes by gathering and analyzing data to assess their tax liabilities.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full341" style="display:none;">The new regulations concerning the equalization tax could significantly impact the operations of both international and domestic groups. This tax, part of the global minimum tax level, will cover a wide range of entities but also includes numerous exclusions and exemptions.<br><br>The equalization tax applies to multinational enterprise groups with subsidiaries in other countries, including Poland, if the parent entity is based outside of Poland; multinational groups with subsidiaries in other countries where the parent company is based in Poland; and domestic groups operating solely in Poland. Unlike OECD model rules, this tax applies not only to multinational groups but also to groups where all qualified entities are based in a member state like Poland.<br><br>Exemptions include taxpayers who are not qualified entities of multinational or domestic groups, taxpayers who are part of multinational or domestic groups with consolidated revenues not exceeding €750 million at least twice in the four years preceding the tax year, or groups that existed for less than four tax years but have exceeded that revenue threshold in at least two years. Governmental bodies, international organizations, non-profit organizations, pension funds, investment funds, real estate investment entities, and entities where at least 95% of the nominal value of their shares is held by exempt entities are also excluded. Furthermore, entities where at least 85% of the nominal value of their shares is held by exempt entities, provided that almost all of their income comes from tax-exempt dividends, are also exempt.<br><br>Significant changes have been introduced following public consultations, including clarifying which taxes in Poland will qualify, such as CIT, withholding tax, tax on income from virtual currency sales, controlled foreign company tax, tax on shifted profits, tax on income from buildings, minimum tax under Article 24ca of the CIT Act, tax on qualified income from intellectual property rights (IP Box), and tax on income from unrealized gains.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full342" style="display:none;">More companies are supporting employees in difficult situations, such as financing rehabilitation, which raises legal and tax questions. Paying for rehabilitation is a non-cash benefit, considered a form of income subject to taxation unless specific exemption conditions are met.<br><br>According to income tax law, any benefit resulting from employment is considered an employee's income. Rehabilitation financed by the company is considered income unless it's related to an individual accident, natural disaster, long-term illness, or death, which could allow for tax exemption. Additionally, it should not be financed from the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS), a social fund, or a trade union fund, which may also allow for tax exemption in certain cases.<br><br>Aid granted due to individual accidents, long-term illness, or other circumstances may be tax-exempt if it meets additional requirements. If from social funds or trade union funds, the exemption applies regardless of the benefit's amount. From other sources, the exemption covers benefits up to 6,000 PLN annually.<br><br>Employers must assess whether the circumstances of the benefit meet the required criteria and are adequately documented. If rehabilitation is financed from the company's budget and meets the conditions for exemption, it's beneficial for both the employee and the employer.<br><br>Key considerations for employers planning such benefits include consulting with accounting, maintaining transparent documentation, understanding tax rules, and considering alternative funding from ZFŚS. Thorough analysis is essential to avoid complications, ensuring compliance and allowing employees to focus on recovery without tax concerns.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full343" style="display:none;">The end of the year is approaching, and new regulations regarding the global minimum tax are coming into effect on January 1, 2025. A short survey helps determine if the equalization tax law will apply to your company. A detailed analysis of Pillar 2 regulations is crucial to ascertain whether your business is subject to these new rules. Early identification enables effective budget and resource planning, essential for well-targeted strategies. Early action allows finance departments to gather data necessary for calculating global or national minimum tax and determining payment obligations.<br><br>A multinational or large domestic group with consolidated annual revenues exceeding EUR 750,000,000 will be subject to the new regulations, provided it surpassed this threshold in at least two of the four years preceding the tax year. This threshold aligns with the country-by-country reporting requirements, allowing Polish companies to verify compliance by checking past CBC-P reporting obligations. Determining if a company will be subject to Pillar 2 requires considering consolidated group revenues from 2021-2024. In 2024, Polish firms must fulfill aspects of the new regulations, necessitating an analysis of financial situations from 2020-2023.<br><br>The global minimum tax aims to ensure international firms pay fair taxes where they operate, eliminating aggressive tax optimization. The draft law introduces three types of equalization tax: the global equalization tax (IIR), where the group's parent entity pays the tax on itself and its low-taxed subsidiaries; the domestic equalization tax (QDMTT), levied in the country where low-taxed components of the group are located; and the equalization tax on insufficiently taxed profits (UTPR), applied when the parent entity operates in a jurisdiction without IIR or the tax wasn't collected under QDMTT. Although Polish lawmakers haven't implemented it, international groups in countries with Pillar 2 (Austria, Belgium, France) must consider the effective tax rate of Polish subsidiaries for 2024, requiring extensive data gathering. If operating in Poland as part of an international structure, assess your company's tax obligations now to prepare for the changes.</p>

It aims to ensure all products, new or used, meet safety standards, excluding items like pharmaceuticals, food, and antiques.<br><br>Manufacturers must conduct risk analysis and create technical documentation for each product, including its description, safety properties, and risk assessment, kept for 10 years. Importers must ensure products meet safety standards and are correctly labeled, also storing technical documentation for 10 years. Distributors are responsible for verifying proper labeling and including safety instructions.<br><br>Product labels must include the manufacturer's (or importer's) electronic address. Companies must implement internal procedures to ensure safety and product compliance and manage product recalls, offering consumers compensation such as repair, replacement, or refund without cost.<br><br>The GPSR mandates ongoing product safety monitoring. Importers and distributors must report concerns to manufacturers, who then inform authorities via the Safety Business Gateway. Manufacturers must record and analyze safety complaints. Consumers can report safety issues, and preparations should begin now even though there is a grace period.<br><br>Non-compliance can result in penalties up to €230,000 for manufacturers and importers introducing non-compliant products, €115,000 for distributors with documentation and labeling failures, and €115,000 for online retailers lacking required information.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full350" style="display:none;">Article 10(1) of the Polish Act on Counteracting Excessive Delays in Commercial Transactions protects creditors from late payments. It grants creditors a flat-rate compensation of 40 euros for debt recovery costs from the day they become entitled to interest due to the debtor's payment delay. This compensation is due without prior notice to the debtor.<br><br>The compensation is calculated in euros and converted to Polish zlotys using the average exchange rate announced by the National Bank of Poland on the last working day of the month preceding the due date. While beneficial for out-of-court settlements and situations with multiple overdue invoices from the same debtor, claiming the 40-euro compensation may be disadvantageous in court if it increases litigation costs beyond the compensation amount. Higher compensation amounts of 70 and 100 euros are applicable when the value of receivables is higher.<br><br>This law applies to commercial transactions involving paid delivery of goods or services, excluding contracts between businesses and consumers. The act simplifies debt recovery and reduces creditors' financial burdens, incentivizing timely payments from debtors.</p>

      <h2>Minimum Corporate Income Tax 2024 – New Rules and Exemptions</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full354" style="display:none;">From January 1, 2024, Poland reintroduced the minimum income tax (CIT) for corporate taxpayers, aimed at preventing tax avoidance by companies reporting losses or low income despite revenue. This tax operates parallel to the standard CIT, and if both taxes are due in the same year, the minimum tax liability is reduced by the amount of CIT owed, avoiding double taxation.<br><br>The minimum tax applies to companies with Polish tax residency, non-residents operating through foreign establishments in Poland, and domestic capital groups. Non-residents with establishments in Poland must carefully assess their business activities, as the new regulations may affect their income and losses related to these establishments.<br><br>Exemptions exist for new businesses (first two years), companies using Estonian CIT, entities with significantly lower revenues compared to the previous year, companies with simple ownership structures, and those deriving most income from specific activities like international transport or resource extraction.<br><br>The tax base is calculated using one of two methods: either 1.5% of revenue plus certain costs exceeding PLN 3 million and debt financing costs exceeding 30% of EBITDA, or 3% of operating revenue. Taxpayers must choose a method and inform the tax authorities in their annual return. Careful financial analysis and awareness of exemptions are crucial to avoid unnecessary tax burdens. Consulting a tax advisor is recommended.</p>

      <h2>Latest Changes in Real Estate and Agricultural Tax - Draft Act of September 2, 2024</h2>
      <p class="date">25.09.2024</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full355" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Finance has prepared another draft law amending the laws on agricultural tax, local taxes and fees, forest tax, and stamp duty, incorporating comments from public consultations. This draft, dated September 2, 2024, focuses on changes to property and agricultural taxes.<br><br>Regarding property tax, the primary changes concern the definitions of "building" and "structure." The Ombudsman pointed out that the draft still references construction law rather than tax laws, potentially causing controversy based on a Constitutional Tribunal ruling that requires precise definition of taxable objects to avoid taxpayer uncertainty. The new definition of a building emphasizes a structure resulting from construction works, permanently attached to the ground, enclosed, with foundations and a roof, excluding storage facilities for bulk, loose, liquid, or gaseous materials where capacity is the key parameter. The definition of "structure" includes objects listed in the annex to the law, wind, nuclear, and photovoltaic power plants, energy storage, boilers, industrial furnaces, cable cars, ski lifts, ski jumps (only construction parts), construction equipment (connections, sewage treatment), industrial equipment (construction parts), and machinery foundations.<br><br>For agricultural tax, changes involve subject exemptions, specifically removing the application-based exemptions outlined in Article 12(2) of the Agricultural Tax Act, which currently exempts entities like universities and research institutes. The justification for this change is that the current application process is overly bureaucratic, as the exemption is based solely on the entity's legal status (university, research institute, etc.) which doesn't require verification through a taxpayer's application.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full356" style="display:none;">Serving as a management board member in a limited liability company entails significant responsibility, potentially encompassing civil, criminal, and tax liabilities. Unlike shareholders, whose liability is limited to their contributions, board members can be held accountable with their entire personal assets.<br><br>Civil liability, primarily governed by the Commercial Companies Code, extends to the company itself and third parties. Board members may be liable for providing false information regarding contributions or causing damage to the company through unlawful actions or omissions. Crucially, they can be held jointly and severally liable for the company's debts if enforcement against the company proves unsuccessful, unless they demonstrate timely filing for bankruptcy, the opening of restructuring proceedings, or that the creditor suffered no damage due to the failure to file.<br><br>Criminal liability can arise from intentional actions or omissions detrimental to the company, punishable by up to five years imprisonment. Failure to file for bankruptcy on time can result in fines, restrictions on freedom, imprisonment, and a ban on conducting business or holding management positions for up to ten years.<br><br>Tax liability can be imposed if the company's tax obligations cannot be fulfilled and the board member fails to prove timely bankruptcy filing or lack of fault. This liability covers tax arrears during their tenure, extend to social security contributions and can be avoided by indicating company assets sufficient to cover the tax debts.<br><br>The extensive liability aims to protect creditors, shareholders, and the company's interests.</p>

      <h2>Local Taxes 2025. Amendment to the Act: Changes in Definitions, Taxation of Garages, and Exemptions</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full357" style="display:none;">In June 2024, the Council of Ministers in Poland published the draft law amending regulations concerning agricultural tax, local taxes and fees, forest tax, and stamp duty. The final version, released on June 17, 2024, introduces significant changes effective from January 1, 2025. Key modifications include revised definitions of "building" and "structure" specifically for property tax purposes, aiming to resolve interpretative disputes between taxpayers and tax authorities. These definitions will be independent from construction law to ensure fiscal stability and reflect judicial precedents.<br><br>The law also standardizes the taxation of multi-space garages in residential buildings, ensuring owners of designated parking spaces pay the same lower tax rate as those with spaces in shared property garages. This equalizes tax burdens by classifying separated multi-space garages as part of the residential building.<br><br>Furthermore, changes are made to tax exemptions for railway infrastructure, cargo terminals, and land, buildings, and structures at public airports, reverting to previous regulations that limit property tax exemptions to areas directly occupied by buildings and structures. Research institutes will only receive tax exemptions for properties used for research activities.<br><br>The bill is scheduled for parliamentary review in Q3 2024. Taxpayers must prepare to submit updated tax information by January 31, 2025, reflecting these new regulations.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full360" style="display:none;">A developer's free transfer of road plots to a municipality necessitates a precise understanding of VAT law. According to VAT regulations, this transfer is subject to taxation based on the purchase price or production cost of the plots and roads at the time of transfer.<br><br>When individual plots are transferred, each plot is treated separately for tax purposes, even if they share a land register. VAT exemptions for buildings and structures transferred with land are contingent on specific conditions. These conditions include the timing of the transfer relative to the first occupancy (first use) and whether VAT deductions were previously claimed for the properties. The law specifies that the first occupancy must involve taxable activities. The exemption applies separately to each building or structure.<br><br>Therefore, different tax treatments can be applied to plots, some of which are built and some of which are vacant. The transaction requires documentation with an internal invoice and reporting in the VAT declaration for the relevant period. If a VAT exemption changes the right to deduct input VAT, a correction must be made in the tax return for the period when the change occurred.</p>

      <h2>Accounting Books: Transformation and Closure of Books When Applying Flat-Rate Tax on Corporate Income. What About the Tax Period?</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full366" style="display:none;">The Estonian CIT taxation, implemented through the CIT act, covers a four-year tax period declared by the taxpayer in form ZAW-RD. However, changes in a company's legal form requiring the closure of accounting books introduce additional regulations that can affect the duration of the taxation period. The article discusses interpretations and the position of the Director of the National Fiscal Information (DKIS), as well as further legal actions taken by a company in response to this situation.<br><br>According to CIT law, the lump-sum taxation covers a four-year period immediately following the date specified by the taxpayer in form ZAW-RD. If separate regulations mandate the closure of accounting books before the taxpayer's chosen tax year ends, the tax year is considered to run from the first day of the month following the end of the previous tax year to the day the books are closed. In this case, the next tax year runs from the day the books are opened to the end of the taxpayer's chosen year.<br><br>Accounting books must be closed on the day preceding a change in legal form. The DKIS stated that the lump-sum taxation period declared in ZAW-RD is a minimum period. While it can be extended, for instance, by changing the fiscal year during the lump-sum taxation period, it cannot be shortened. A company challenged this interpretation, arguing that closing accounting books due to transformation would create two tax years in 2023, shortening the four-year period. The company's complaint to the Provincial Administrative Court (WSA) was unsuccessful, and the case is awaiting review by the Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) after an appeal.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full367" style="display:none;">On July 23, 2024, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled on the reporting of tax schemes (MDR), finding the regulations unconstitutional insofar as they obligate tax advisors to disclose information covered by professional secrecy to the tax authorities. The National Council of Tax Advisors challenged the MDR regulations in 2019, arguing they violated tax advisor confidentiality, following their implementation into Polish law based on the DAC 6 EU directive.<br><br>The Tribunal, after nearly five years, upheld the complaint, stating that the retroactive application of reporting requirements for domestic tax schemes was unconstitutional and violated the principle of *lex retro non agit*. It questioned provisions requiring tax advisors bound by professional secrecy to provide information about tax schemes without sufficient criteria for exemption and deemed the obligation for tax advisor promoters to report non-cross-border schemes also unconstitutional.<br><br>The Tribunal reasoned that the regulations lacked legal clarity under Article 2 of the Constitution and hindered tax advisors from acting within the public interest under Article 17. It emphasized that any modification of professional secrecy must meet high legislative standards and proportionality regarding constitutional rights. The Tribunal indicated that, following the ruling, the state could only obtain information on tax schemes prepared by tax advisors via the beneficiaries who are obliged to report. While the Tribunal discontinued proceedings in other areas of the complaint, the MDR reporting regulations are not entirely eliminated from Polish law and taxpayers remain subject to the reporting requirements.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full368" style="display:none;">In today's dynamic work environment, empathy is crucial for effective leadership. It enables leaders to understand their employees' emotions and needs, building trust and boosting engagement. Empathetic leaders motivate their teams, leading to higher productivity and job satisfaction. Developing empathy requires conscious effort, including active listening, observing non-verbal cues, and reflecting on one's own emotions.<br><br>Practical application involves regular one-on-one meetings, supporting work-life balance, and fostering a culture of open feedback. Challenges exist, such as balancing high standards with employee well-being, but empathy doesn't preclude achieving results; instead, it cultivates a more engaged team. Successful leaders like Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand exemplify the power of empathy in leadership. Empathetic leadership isn't merely a management tool but a mindset fostering strong, trust-based relationships, improving team atmosphere, and boosting employee efficiency.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full369" style="display:none;">A Swiss company registered for VAT in Poland, but lacking a permanent establishment there, sought clarification on using its Swiss VAT ID for Polish-sourced transport services. The Polish tax authority stated that since the company lacks a permanent establishment in Poland, it should use its foreign VAT ID, even if registered for VAT in Poland. Using a Polish VAT ID could mislead the service provider about the place of supply. The authority confirmed that the company can deduct VAT from invoices with its Swiss VAT ID for services taxed in Poland. Correcting such invoices with a credit note is unnecessary, as the invoices are correct. The tax authority emphasized that if a foreign entity has a permanent establishment in Poland that participates in a transaction, it must use a Polish VAT ID. However, in this case, the Swiss company does not have a fixed establishment. Moore Polska Tax & Legal offers assistance in navigating complex tax regulations and securing individual interpretations.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full371" style="display:none;">This material comprehensively discusses seven key risks associated with Estonian CIT, a crucial resource for businesses considering this taxation system.<br><br>The risks include: **Hidden Profits:** Defined as benefits to shareholders related to profit participation, encompassing loans, donations, representation expenses, and transaction market value excesses. Exceptions apply, such as salaries below a certain threshold. **Transfer Pricing:** Transfer pricing regulations still apply; companies must prepare relevant documentation. **Significant Limitations:** The flat-rate taxation lasts for four years, extendable if certain employment or expense conditions are met. Companies cannot acquire shares in other companies or use tax reliefs like R&D or IP Box. **Loss of Eligibility:** Losing eligibility occurs at the end of the four-year period or due to non-compliance with passive income, employment, legal form, or ownership structure requirements. Re-election is possible after three years. **Exclusion from Reliefs:** Estonian CIT excludes the use of reliefs such as bad debt relief, R&D relief, IP Box, innovative employee relief, and others. **Limitation on Loss Deduction:** Companies lose the right to deduct past losses, although deductions are possible in the two years preceding the first flat-rate year, provided the system is used for at least four years. **Election During the Tax Year:** Choosing the flat rate is possible mid-year by filing a ZAW-RD notification before the financial statement preparation.<br><br>The "7 Risks Associated with Estonian CIT" guide is offered for download, and further inquiries are welcomed.</p>

      <h2>DAC7 Directive – New Regulations Regarding MDR</h2>
      <p class="date">09.07.2024</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary372">The EU's DAC7 directive, effective from July 1, 2024, concerning the reporting of income earned through digital platforms, has been implemented into Polish law via a new act published on June 17, 2024</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full372" style="display:none;">The EU's DAC7 directive, effective from July 1, 2024, concerning the reporting of income earned through digital platforms, has been implemented into Polish law via a new act published on June 17, 2024. This legislation introduces obligations not only for digital platform operators but also for promoters and assistants involved in the protection of personal data of individuals.<br><br>A new Article 86da of the Tax Ordinance mandates promoters and assistants providing information about tax schemes concerning individuals to inform these individuals in writing about the collection, processing, and transfer of their data, as well as their rights to access information from the data controller, before the information is transferred. They must also promptly notify individuals in writing if there is a potential breach of security regarding their personal data collected and processed for automatic information exchange, particularly if it could negatively impact their data protection.<br><br>Exceptions to this obligation exist when the information provided doesn't concern individuals or when the entity acts solely as a user. When acting as a data controller, promoters and assistants must provide detailed information including their identity, contact details, the purpose and legal basis for processing data, recipients of the data, storage period, rights to access, rectify, or delete data, the right to complain to a supervisory authority, and whether providing data is a statutory or contractual requirement.<br><br>The law defines "data breach" broadly, encompassing any security breach resulting from intentional, unlawful actions, negligence, or accidents, leading to data destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized access, disclosure, or use, especially concerning personal data. Entities must regularly review and update internal procedures to comply with the new regulations, particularly regarding MDR reporting and personal data protection. Non-compliance can result in penalties up to 2,000,000 PLN, or up to 10,000,000 PLN for unreported obligations, and potential RODO fines of up to 20 million EUR or 4% of annual global turnover. The act aims to combat tax fraud by standardizing financial reporting for digital operators in the EU and updates existing MDR procedures.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full373" style="display:none;">The taxation of advance payments on profit for general partners in limited joint-stock partnerships (SKA) is interpreted differently by tax authorities and administrative courts. It is crucial to understand the positions of both to avoid tax errors.<br><br>Article 41(4e) of the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Act mandates SKAs to collect a flat-rate income tax (19%) on dividends and other income from profit participation, as per Article 30a(1)(4), considering the rules in Article 30a(6a-6e). Article 30a(6a) allows this tax to be reduced by an amount calculated as the product of the general partner's percentage share in the profit and the tax due from the SKA's income.<br><br>Tax interpretations vary. A KIS interpretation from July 23, 2021, states that advance payments to general partners are taxable at 19% upon payment, requiring the company to collect the tax. However, a June 7, 2021, interpretation suggests the company doesn't need to collect the tax at the time of payment; instead, the tax should be calculated after the SKA's tax for the fiscal year is determined, according to Article 30a(6a).<br><br>The Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) echoed the latter view, stating that calculating the general partner's income tax requires knowing the SKA's tax due for the year, making the tax obligation arise only after the company files its CIT return. Taxpayers who opt to withhold tax on advance payments can apply for a refund based on overpayment. If the NSA's view is adopted, the SKA would withhold tax only after calculating its income following the CIT return. The withheld tax is due by the 20th of the following month and reported in PIT-8AR. If no tax is withheld, the general partner reports it in their annual PIT return for the year the SKA filed its CIT return.<br><br>Navigating this complex issue requires careful consideration and consultation with a tax advisor.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full378" style="display:none;">On May 9, 2024, the President of Poland approved a law implementing the European Accessibility Act (EAA) into Polish law, effective June 28, 2025. This act complements the Polish "Accessibility Plus" program by establishing accessibility requirements for specific products and services offered by private sector entities. The EAA aims to improve the internal market by removing barriers to the free movement of accessible goods and services.<br><br>The EAA defines individuals with functional limitations broadly, aligning with the Polish term "persons with special needs." It seeks to increase accessibility for all, regardless of ability, and raise awareness about accessibility issues. The law mandates that businesses offering products and services covered by the directive, including manufacturers, distributors, importers, and service providers, must comply with its accessibility requirements.<br><br>Covered products include general-purpose computer hardware systems and operating systems, payment terminals, self-service terminals, ATMs, ticketing machines, consumer terminal equipment for telecommunications and audiovisual media services, and e-books. Covered services include access to audiovisual media services, passenger transport (road, air, rail, and water), retail banking, e-book distribution, and e-commerce. The implementation of the EAA is a significant step toward fostering a more inclusive and accessible society by harmonizing Polish law with EU standards and promoting equality.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full379" style="display:none;">Since the economic transformation of 1989, Poland has witnessed significant economic and social changes. Many companies emerged, facing numerous challenges. A report by the Family Firms Foundation sheds light on businesses that have not only survived but thrived, becoming pillars of the Polish economy.<br><br>Resilience has been key to survival, enabling firms to adapt to changing conditions, including global recessions, legislative changes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the conflict in Ukraine. The report identifies 13,776 companies founded in 1989 still operating in Poland. These businesses have contributed to Poland's economic growth through innovation and technology adoption, proving more agile and faster in decision-making than larger corporations. Most are SMEs, often family-run, facilitating quicker decisions, but also presenting succession and risk management challenges. Succession planning is crucial for family businesses, balancing tradition with modern approaches, and can drive growth when implemented strategically. Increasingly, women are taking leadership roles, bringing fresh perspectives and fostering diverse teams. These established businesses face challenges like rising energy costs, inflation, and regulatory changes, but their experience prepares them for the future. Investing in technology, education, and sustainable development is vital. Moore Polska, a firm with 35 years of history, combines family values with global standards, offering audit, accounting, legal, tax, and ESG services.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full383" style="display:none;">For many new entrepreneurs, office rental costs can be a significant financial burden. A virtual office not only eliminates this problem but also provides a professional company image and helps meet legal requirements for a mailing address and business registration.<br><br>A virtual office is a service that allows registration of a business at a virtual address, without the need for a physical office. This service also includes receiving and managing correspondence, which is convenient for entrepreneurs working remotely or from various locations.<br><br>Polish law requires every entrepreneur to indicate an address where they will conduct business. A virtual office enables this requirement to be met, offering legal title to the address through a lease agreement. Lack of legal title can lead to problems with VAT registration and potential deletion from the Central Registration and Information on Business (CEIDG).<br><br>Signing a virtual office lease agreement before registering a business allows for better planning and organization of the initial phase of running the company. This ensures a smooth transition from the registration process to the actual commencement of operations, minimizing stress related to formalities and allowing for a focus on business development.<br><br>In summary, a virtual office offers not only cost savings and flexibility but also a solid foundation for building a professional company image.<br><br>Virtual offices offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for entrepreneurs. They eliminate the burden of physical office rental while providing a professional business address for registration and correspondence. Crucially, a virtual office ensures compliance with legal requirements, as Polish law mandates a registered business address. Securing a virtual office lease before registering a business streamlines the initial setup, preventing potential issues with VAT registration and business listing. By handling mail and offering a credible address, virtual offices allow entrepreneurs to focus on core business activities rather than administrative tasks. Therefore, a virtual office provides cost-efficiency, legal compliance, and a professional image, all vital for success in today's competitive business environment.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full384" style="display:none;">In the era of digitalization and remote work, many entrepreneurs are opting for e-offices as a legal address for business registration, despite some initial hesitations from tax authorities. The legality of e-offices is supported by the Law on Freedom of Economic Activity, granting businesses the freedom to choose their registered office and provide services in their preferred manner. A 2014 Supreme Administrative Court ruling further reinforces this, stating businesses can operate from any location, including e-offices, facilitated by modern technology.<br><br>E-offices provide numerous benefits: safeguarding privacy by using the e-office address instead of a home address on public records, financial flexibility due to the absence of long-term contracts, and administrative assistance. Security measures employed by e-office providers protect client data. When choosing an e-office, factors to consider include the prestige of the location, offered additional services (mail handling, document scanning, legal support), and client reviews.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full385" style="display:none;">Cryptocurrency sales in Poland may be exempt from VAT, which is a significant benefit for businesses operating in this rapidly growing industry. However, correctly determining the place of service provision and the tax status of foreign counterparties is crucial to take advantage of the available exemptions.<br><br>According to the VAT Act, the sale of cryptocurrencies is considered a service. Transactions involving currencies, banknotes, and coins used as legal tender are VAT-exempt. Virtual currency units accepted as alternative means of payment fulfill the function of legal tender, thus, cryptocurrency sales fall within this exemption.<br><br>The place of service provision is a key factor. If it's within Poland, the sale is VAT-exempt. However, if the place of service isn't in Poland, specific articles of the VAT Act apply, indicating that services provided to foreign entities are not subject to VAT in Poland. It's essential to determine if the foreign client meets the definition of a taxpayer, meaning they independently conduct economic activity, even under other countries' legal systems.<br><br>In practice, Polish cryptocurrency sales are VAT-exempt, provided the place of service is correctly determined and the foreign counterparty's tax status is verified. Businesses should analyze each transaction carefully to ensure compliance with VAT exemption requirements and consider professional tax advisory services to avoid potential disputes with tax authorities.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full395" style="display:none;">Effective April 1, 2024, Poland is reinstating a 5% VAT rate on food products, ending the period of a zero percent rate implemented as part of an anti-inflation shield in response to economic challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. This measure had temporarily eliminated VAT on a wide range of essential food items, including meat, fish, dairy, eggs, honey, fruits, vegetables, and specific products for infants and medical purposes.<br><br>The decision to revert to the 5% VAT rate is attributed to the country's improving economic situation and decreasing inflation, which had fallen to 3.9%. The return to the standard VAT rate is expected to stabilize the market and the state budget in the long term.<br><br>Consumers may experience price increases on basic food items, impacting household budgets, especially those with lower incomes. While the 5% rate is relatively low, the reintroduction could create short-term market volatility as retailers adjust pricing. The food industry is preparing for the change. Experts emphasize that this step is a move toward normalizing the country's economic and fiscal situation. Companies like Moore Polska highlight the importance of monitoring the change's impact on inflation and the need for continued government support for households and the food sector.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full404" style="display:none;">The balance sheet valuation of finished goods, according to the Polish Accounting Act and IAS 2 (International Accounting Standard 2), refers to determining the value of these products on the balance sheet date within a company's accounting records. Finished goods are defined as tangible assets produced or processed by an entity, intended for sale in the ordinary course of business, meaning they have completed all production phases.<br><br>Both Polish law and IAS 2 mandate that these assets are valued at the lower of their acquisition cost or production cost, or their net realizable value (NRV). NRV represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. This principle is rooted in the prudence concept, requiring companies to account for potential decreases in asset value.<br><br>IAS 2 provides detailed guidelines for inventory valuation to ensure comparability of financial statements. It allows for two primary valuation methods: cost and net realizable value. When market value falls below cost, NRV becomes crucial for accurately reflecting economic value. Companies must adjust their accounting records to reflect such decreases, either individually or by grouping similar inventory items. Proper year-end valuation is essential for accurate financial reporting, especially for entities with significant inventory levels, ensuring transparency for auditors and investors, and aiding management. Companies should consult accounting professionals to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and standards, as local requirements may add further stipulations.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full405" style="display:none;">The ACCA Think Ahead survey, involving 9,889 finance professionals across 157 countries (57% women, 39% men), reveals key global talent trends in accounting and finance for 2024. The study highlights a dual sentiment towards Artificial Intelligence (AI), with significant excitement about its potential alongside persistent concerns about job displacement. The cost of living crisis is also a major challenge, pressuring employers to manage rising salary expectations and maintain competitiveness.<br><br>Hybrid working models present both benefits and challenges, with a noted divergence between employee expectations and workplace realities, necessitating flexible approaches. Diversity and inclusion (EDI) are recognized as crucial for organizational attractiveness, yet there's a call for broader definitions of diversity to foster creativity. Mental health remains a concern, indicating a need for better workload management and employee support to combat burnout. The accounting profession offers broad career opportunities, but talent retention is challenging due to significant professional mobility, requiring nuanced strategies to keep employees engaged. This comprehensive survey underscores the multifaceted challenges and opportunities facing the finance and accounting sector in the AI era.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full406" style="display:none;">In an era of growing ecological and social awareness, ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) has become a pivotal concept for businesses pursuing sustainable success, evolving from a trend into a cornerstone of modern enterprises. ESG serves as a three-faceted evaluation model assessing a company's environmental protection efforts, social welfare contributions, and internal corporate governance standards.<br><br>The significance of ESG in contemporary business is profound. It is no longer a mere concept but an integral part of business strategies, leading to enhanced brand image, increased customer trust, and greater investor confidence. Consumers increasingly favor sustainable companies, and investors are factoring ESG criteria into their decision-making. Furthermore, effective ESG management yields tangible financial benefits, including reduced operational costs, minimized risks, and boosted innovation, contributing to long-term company growth.<br><br>Successful ESG implementation requires a cohesive strategy and the commitment of all employees, reflecting a fundamental business mindset. Key steps include developing a clear ESG policy with defined goals and metrics, integrating ESG into the overall business strategy, consistently monitoring progress, and publishing transparent reports. Employee education on ESG principles is also crucial for enhancing awareness and engagement. Building ESG awareness among employees and customers through training and engaging initiatives strengthens brand loyalty and trust.<br><br>Ultimately, ESG is not just a trend but a critical component of a sustainable business strategy, fostering better financial performance and lasting stakeholder relationships. While its implementation demands consistency and commitment, the benefits for both business and society are substantial, guiding companies toward a more sustainable, modern future.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full408" style="display:none;">In the Polish legal system, corporate income tax reliefs are key legislative tools designed to positively shape business conditions. This article details various CIT reliefs available in Poland.<br><br>The **IP BOX** relief offers a preferential 5% tax rate on income derived from legally protected intellectual property rights created, developed, or improved through R&D activities. It can be combined with other reliefs such as robotization, R&D, prototype, and expansion reliefs. Eligibility requires conducting R&D, generating income from qualifying IP, and possessing IP that has been developed or improved. Qualifying IP includes patents, utility model rights, and software copyrights.<br><br>The **R&D relief** supports creative activities, including systematic scientific research or development work aimed at creating new applications. It allows for the recovery of up to 38% of R&D expenses and can be used concurrently with other reliefs. Qualifying activities involve developing software, optimizing production processes, or creating new technologies.<br><br>**IPO reliefs** are for joint-stock companies entering the market. An issuer relief allows for deducting advisory and legal costs related to share issuance, capped at 50% of costs or PLN 50,000. For individual investors, purchasing shares during an IPO and holding them for at least three years exempts them from capital gains tax on sale profits.<br><br>The **Expansion relief** permits a double deduction of expenses incurred to expand sales markets. To qualify, businesses must meet specific revenue targets within two consecutive tax years, such as introducing new products or increasing sales in foreign markets.<br><br>Relief for supporting **sport, culture, and education** allows non-agricultural businesses to deduct 50% of expenses incurred on these activities, up to the level of income generated from their business operations, provided these costs haven't been reimbursed or previously deducted.<br><br>The **Robotization relief** allows an additional 50% deduction of expenses on robotization, effectively allowing 150% cost recognition (100% as an expense and 50% as a relief). Eligible costs include acquiring new industrial robots and related peripheral equipment.<br><br>The **Consolidation relief** is for Polish companies acquiring other entities, allowing an additional deduction for expenses directly related to acquiring shares in a capital company.<br><br>The **Prototype relief** permits an additional 30% deduction of expenses related to trial production and market introduction of new products, and can be combined with other reliefs.<br><br>The **Innovative Employees relief** targets businesses incurring losses or low profits, allowing them to deduct qualifying R&D expenses from advance tax payments on employee salaries.<br><br>The **Payment Terminal relief** is for businesses acquiring payment terminals. It offers a deduction of up to PLN 2,500 for entities exempt from sales registration for specific individuals and farmers, and PLN 1,000 for others, covering terminal acquisition and transaction service costs.</p>

      <h2>7 sins of small and medium-sized businesses in finance</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full410" style="display:none;">Misunderstanding and ineffective financial management can lead to serious problems for businesses. This article outlines seven common financial "sins" of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and provides actionable advice on how to avoid them.<br><br>The first sin is the **lack of clearly defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and regular verification**. Many entrepreneurs fail to establish financial metrics and budgets, leading to disorientation and loss of control. Regularly monitoring revenue, margins, results, inventory value, and working capital, along with budgeting, is crucial for better control and alignment with financial goals.<br><br>The second is **insufficient working capital management**. Neglecting receivables and inventory can cause payment bottlenecks and freeze capital. Implementing debt collection processes and systematically managing inventory turnover and customer payment terms are vital for financial liquidity.<br><br>The third sin is **ineffective management of purchases and liabilities**. Poor negotiation with suppliers, lack of multiple offers, and inefficient control over financial obligations result in excessive costs and payment difficulties. Negotiating better payment terms and exploring various offers can improve the company's financial standing.<br><br>The fourth is the **absence of periodic cash flow analysis**. Many entrepreneurs overlook cash flow, leading to a lack of control over available funds. Regular cash flow analysis allows for informed management, quick reaction to liquidity issues, and accurate financial planning by estimating inflows and outflows.<br><br>The fifth is **lacking a financial cushion**. Without a financial reserve, companies are vulnerable to sudden expenses or revenue drops. Securing financing like an overdraft or leasing, even during prosperous times, acts as an insurance policy against future financial difficulties.<br><br>The sixth sin is **mismatched financing to business needs**. Incorrectly understanding financing types can lead to over-indebtedness or misallocation of funds. Aligning funding sources with specific company needs, such as using long-term debt for fixed assets, is essential for optimizing financial structure.<br><br>Finally, the seventh sin is **managing based on tax minimization**. Focusing solely on reducing taxes like VAT, CIT, and PIT, rather than creating enterprise value, leads to short-sighted financial management and can ultimately diminish the company's valuation. A long-term perspective, considering tax implications, and consulting with financial and tax advisors are recommended.<br><br>Avoiding these financial pitfalls requires awareness, planning, the use of appropriate financial tools, and expert consultation.</p>

      <h2>New MF Decisions Regarding KSeF – How Will They Affect Entrepreneurs?</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full411" style="display:none;">The Polish Ministry of Finance has announced a delay in the mandatory implementation of the National e-Invoicing System (KSeF). Initially slated for July 1, 2024, for all businesses and January 1, 2025, for VAT-exempt small and medium-sized enterprises, the new deadline will be announced after an audit of the system’s development. The Ministry acknowledged critical errors in KSeF’s IT infrastructure and code, which could have impacted its performance. To address these issues, a technological audit has been commissioned. Furthermore, the Ministry plans to hold consultations with entrepreneurs to ensure the system's successful implementation with their input. Despite the postponement, the Ministry emphasizes that KSeF will eventually become mandatory, and development work will continue. Businesses that have not yet prepared for KSeF can now take a brief respite but must remain ready for future integration and compliance with the new requirements. The delay provides companies an opportunity to prepare for the system’s eventual rollout, ensuring smooth operations and reliable invoice processing.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full413" style="display:none;">In today's global economy, international goods transport is crucial for many businesses. However, disruptions or delays in transport can impact VAT taxation. This article examines the issue of VAT on transport delays, analyzing different viewpoints and associated risks.<br><br>**Taxation of Delays:** If a transport delay stems from a carriage contract with loading and unloading clauses, the demurrage fee increases the VAT taxable base. Such additional fees are considered part of the international transport service and are taxed at the rate applicable to that service, as confirmed by tax authorities and courts.<br><br>**Compensation vs. Fee:** If demurrage costs are considered compensation and not a service provision, they are not subject to VAT. In such cases, a debit note is the appropriate document, not affecting VAT liability.<br><br>**Risks and Case Law:** Tax authorities and administrative courts have varying stances on transport delays. For goods export, proof of departure from Poland and maintained product characteristics is required. Transport interruptions or warehousing can lead to the loss of preferential VAT rates.<br><br>**Conclusion:** If a business transports goods by sea to a non-EU contractor and stops at an EU port for additional loading, export can be demonstrated if the original goods remain unchanged and were not unloaded, with the stop solely for adding other cargo. However, due to differing official opinions, meticulous documentation of the transaction is necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences. Businesses must be aware of the tax risks associated with transport delays and thoroughly analyze transport processes to ensure correct VAT accounting.<br><br>For further questions on transport taxation, contact our specialists.<br><br>Analysis, Transport Delay, Risks, Transport, VAT<br><br>Contact us: agnieszka.drozdz-wilk@moorepolska.pl</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full445" style="display:none;">A taxpayer is entitled to interest for the entire period during which unduly collected tax is held. On June 8, 2023, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled in case C-322/22 that a taxpayer who has paid undue tax is entitled to interest for the entire period the tax authorities held the amount. This ruling primarily concerns situations where the obligation to pay a specific tax has been previously challenged by the CJEU.<br><br>The case stemmed from a U.S. investment fund's request to Polish tax authorities for a refund of taxes on dividends from Polish companies, based on a previous CJEU ruling from June 10, 2014, case C-190/12, which stated that such dividends are exempt from income tax. Despite this ruling, Polish law hasn't been updated to reflect it. The CJEU in C-322/22 found that Article 78 § 5 points 1 and 2 of the Polish Tax Ordinance Act are inconsistent with EU law. These provisions limit interest on tax overpayments resulting from CJEU rulings, granting it only from the date of overpayment to 30 days after the CJEU's judgment publication, or not at all if the refund request is filed after that date.<br><br>The CJEU reasoned that anyone burdened with tax due to a breach of EU law is entitled to a full refund of the tax amount and all applicable interest. The amount of interest should not depend on when the refund request is filed, as taxpayers may not be aware of CJEU rulings at the same time. This ruling is crucial for taxpayers, enabling them to claim refunds and interest for the entire period their tax payments were held, without necessarily waiting for Polish law to be amended.</p>

      <h2>5 Steps to Ask Well</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full447" style="display:none;">Though it seems simple, the saying "He who asks doesn't stray" holds great wisdom, suggesting we can avoid mistakes by learning from others' experience. Asking questions stimulates creativity and is the first step toward finding answers. Asking the right questions is key to communication.<br><br>It's sometimes difficult to ask questions, because it's not just about asking, but asking *good* questions. Many ask questions incorrectly, resulting in poor answers. Before asking, consider what you hope to gain. Be inquisitive and specific to open up dialogue. Google is a great example: the more specific your search terms, the better the results. Asking questions, as Socrates noted, is a way to reach the truth. Don't assume you know best; ask questions to broaden your horizons.<br><br>Before you ask a question, define your goal. What do you hope to achieve? Ensure the question is relevant to the context, situation, and person you're asking. Choose the right person based on their expertise. Be specific in your question to get a clear, comprehensive answer, focusing on the core issue without unnecessary jargon. Listen carefully to the answer, even if it challenges your assumptions. Be open to different perspectives and maintain eye contact, sharing your doubts and asking follow-up questions. Regardless of the other person's attitude, remain calm and respectful. Good manners open doors. Asking the right questions in the right way is a trait of good leaders. Questions are powerful tools for development, stimulating thought and building self-awareness, often leading to valuable, lasting relationships.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full448" style="display:none;">Tax planning is crucial for optimizing tax burdens, and in VAT law, creating a VAT group can be a helpful tool. This allows multiple entities to be treated as a single taxpayer, a concept introduced by the implementation of Directive 112. The aim was to standardize regulations across EU member states to prevent market distortions.<br><br>To form a VAT group, members must have economic, financial, and organizational links and be based in the country. Financial ties mean one member holds at least 50% of shares or voting rights in the others. Economic ties exist if their main activities are similar, complementary, or if one member's activities heavily benefit the others. Organizational ties involve common management or coordinated operations.<br><br>Once a VAT group is established, internal transactions become tax-neutral, requiring no invoicing or reporting. Dealings with external entities are treated as transactions of the VAT group. While each member fulfills VAT obligations through the group, a designated representative handles tax settlements. If members previously used a pre-VAT coefficient to determine deductible VAT on mixed-use purchases, the group should continue using the individual members' pre-coefficients from the year the group was formed.<br><br>VAT groups offer benefits such as simplifying tax administration and facilitating effective tax planning by treating the members as a single taxpayer.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full449" style="display:none;">According to Article 1a, paragraph 1, point 2 of the Law on Local Taxes and Fees, a "budowla" (structure) is a construction object as defined by construction law, excluding buildings or minor architectural objects, and includes construction equipment related to the object, enabling its use according to its intended purpose.<br><br>On July 4, 2023, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that this definition is unconstitutional and will lose its validity within 18 months of the ruling's publication. The case arose from a dispute concerning the taxation of silos, with a company arguing they should be classified as buildings based on their characteristics, leading to a lower tax assessment based on usable area rather than initial value (used for "budowla"). The Tribunal agreed that defining tax objects by referencing other laws violates the constitutional principle that tax elements should be defined solely within tax laws. The Tribunal emphasized that taxpayers should be able to determine their tax obligations based solely on tax laws without needing to refer to other legislation. The ruling necessitates a new definition of "budowla" in the Law on Local Taxes and Fees and potential changes to the legal definition of "building", both without referencing non-tax laws, within 18 months. Until the amendments, the current definition remains valid.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full451" style="display:none;">Tax Capital Groups (TCG) are gaining popularity among CIT taxpayers due to the simplified conditions for their establishment introduced in 2021. One major advantage is the ability to file a consolidated income tax return. However, TCG status applies solely within the scope of the CIT Act, meaning constituent companies retain tax autonomy under other tax laws.<br><br>To form a TCG, several conditions must be met. Participating companies must be capital-related entities in the form of a joint-stock company, limited liability company, or simple joint-stock company. The minimum share capital for each company has been reduced to PLN 250,000. A dominant company must be designated, responsible for calculating, collecting, and paying CIT, and holding at least 75% of the share capital in subsidiary companies. Furthermore, the companies must not have outstanding tax payments to the state budget.<br><br>A written agreement for at least three tax years is obligatory, filed with the tax office 45 days before the TCG's tax year begins. The agreement must include a list of companies, their share capital, shareholder information, the agreement's duration, and the group's tax year.<br><br>TCGs simplify CIT settlement through consolidated income calculation. Income is the surplus of total income over total losses from the same revenue source across all group companies. Losses can be carried forward. Intra-group transactions are generally exempt from transfer pricing documentation, but market prices must still be applied. Transactions with related parties outside the group are subject to standard transfer pricing documentation requirements. VAT is handled independently by each company within the TCG, though VAT Groups offer similar tax planning advantages in the VAT context. Forming a TCG offers legal tax optimization benefits by consolidating income tax settlements and potentially reducing documentation burdens.</p>

      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full452" style="display:none;">A VAT payer can be a large company or a sole proprietor. However, holding VAT payer status doesn't automatically define whether the entity is an active VAT payer (obliged to remit tax) or a passive one (exempt). VAT, or Value Added Tax, is a public levy remitted to the State Treasury. In Poland, whether an entity is subject to VAT depends on whether they are eligible for VAT exemptions under the law.<br><br>There are two main types of VAT exemptions: subject-matter exemptions, based on the type of service or item being taxed, and personal exemptions, related to the entity conducting the business that would normally be taxed. Subject-matter exemptions exclude specific services and items from VAT, as listed in Article 43(1) of the VAT Act. Personal exemptions, according to Article 113(1) of the VAT Act, are available to entrepreneurs whose taxable sales did not exceed 200,000 PLN in the previous tax year.<br><br>This limit applies to annual sales, and is prorated for businesses starting mid-year. Those using the personal exemption must track sales to avoid losing eligibility. Exceeding the 200,000 PLN limit requires immediate registration as an active VAT payer, with penalties for non-compliance. Article 113(13) lists goods and services always subject to VAT, regardless of sales value.<br><br>Entrepreneurs can simultaneously utilize both subject-matter and personal exemptions, provided they meet the specific criteria for each. For instance, a business providing services exempt under Article 43(1) can also use the personal exemption if its sales of taxable goods are below 200,000 PLN and the goods aren't excluded under Article 113(13). Taxpayers wanting to use the personal exemption are not required to inform the tax office. In summary, taxpayers eligible for both types of exemptions can use both, but they must carefully verify that they meet all legal requirements.</p>

      <h2>Cash Pooling Agreements Under Tax Law</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full454" style="display:none;">Cash pooling is a system used by capital groups to manage financial liquidity and intra-group financing. It's a banking service that enables efficient management of funds and debt limits by balancing the balances between company accounts. Surplus funds are transferred from companies with excess cash to those with deficits, managed through a "Pool Leader."<br><br>Cash pooling agreements, common within tax capital groups, aim to facilitate the efficient financing of participants' working capital needs. The operation depends on internal group agreements, notably the method of fund distribution. While flexibility in structuring agreements offers advantages, tax implications must be considered.<br><br>Cash pooling agreements, not explicitly defined in the Civil Code, resemble loan agreements but aren't treated as such. Unlike loans, there's no obligation to transfer a specific amount to a designated entity. This is because a participant with surplus funds cannot determine how much of their funds will be used or by whom, as confirmed by the National Tax Information Director. Therefore, cash pooling isn't subject to civil law transaction tax.<br><br>Withholding tax applies if a foreign company participates in cash pooling. Interest payments under the agreement require the payer to collect withholding tax. It's crucial to determine the recipient of the interest income to apply the correct double taxation avoidance agreement. The payer must determine the taxpayer's residency to apply the appropriate double taxation avoidance agreement, potentially reducing or eliminating the tax if a tax residency certificate is provided. Ultimately, the actual owner of the interest must be verified, and the relevant double taxation treaty's provisions must be determined.</p>

This applies only to first-time disability certificate holders. This additional vacation is granted in hourly increments based on the daily work schedule. Unused vacation time carries over to the next year. After 12 months from the certificate's issue date, a new employer must grant the additional vacation from the first day of employment.<br><br>Employees with moderate or severe disabilities automatically have their work hours reduced to 7 hours per day and 35 hours per week upon submitting their certificate.

This leave is calculated like vacation pay and, combined with additional vacation, cannot exceed 21 days annually. A doctor's referral is required for rehabilitation leave, and proof of attendance must be provided.<br><br>Employers are required to adapt the workstation to meet the individual needs of the disabled employee. The employer reports the number of employees with disability certificates in declarations to PFRON (State Fund for Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons), affecting the contribution amount.<br><br>The procedures are based on the Act of August 27, 1997, on vocational and social rehabilitation and employment of disabled persons and related regulations.

The law aims to simplify every stage of starting and running a business.<br><br>The package is built on four pillars: facilitating starting a business, simplifying business operations, streamlining succession, and creating business-friendly economic law. It addresses entrepreneurs' needs by reducing regulations, leading to time and cost savings. This includes clearer rules for unregistered businesses and minors starting businesses, aiming to eliminate legal loopholes.<br><br>The law seeks to improve relations between businesses and public administration by reducing in-person visits, providing advance notice of audits with document lists, and reducing paperwork. The use of stamps will also be limited.<br><br>Succession is streamlined through automatic extensions of succession management, consistent bank account access for succession managers, joint exercise of rights to shares, and reduced requirements for establishing succession management.<br><br>Business law will be more friendly to businesses through the "one in, one out" principle, mandatory ex-post regulatory impact assessments, and a cyclical regulatory policy every four years.<br><br>Changes are also proposed for the Tax Ordinance, CIT, and local taxes. The Tax Ordinance would allow waiving appeal procedures if the party agrees with the first-instance decision. MDR-3 form signatures could be made by proxy. The law aims to provide a closed list of tax-related information required in tax strategies. Also, a central source of information on local tax rates will be created. Finally, average rye and wood prices for agricultural and forestry taxes would be determined by July 20th, instead of October 20th.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full462" style="display:none;">Since January 2023, the Polish Fiscal Penal Code has tightened regulations regarding transfer pricing, with potentially fluctuating higher fines throughout the year. Failure to comply with transfer pricing documentation obligations can result in penalties under both the Fiscal Penal Code and the Tax Ordinance. Sanctions can be levied for failing to prepare local transfer pricing documentation, omitting group documentation, submitting documentation late, or providing inaccurate transfer pricing information.<br><br>The Fiscal Penal Code imposes penalties up to 720 daily rates (potentially up to PLN 33.5 million) for non-preparation or inaccurate documentation, and up to 240 daily rates (potentially up to PLN 11.17 million) for late submission. Failure to submit transfer pricing information or submitting inaccurate data also carries a penalty of up to 720 daily rates, while late TPR form submission incurs a penalty of up to 240 daily rates. Lesser offenses may result in fines for fiscal violations.<br><br>The Tax Ordinance also stipulates penalties, with rates of 10% applied to improperly understated or overstated amounts. This increases to 20% if the documentation is incomplete or not provided, or if the additional tax liability exceeds PLN 15 million. The maximum rate of 30% applies if documentation is not submitted and the additional tax liability exceeds PLN 15 million. If incomplete documentation is fully supplemented within 14 days, the lack of documentation is waived.<br><br>Transfer pricing controls are becoming more frequent and stringent, especially when companies show losses for more than a year, make significant post-year-end adjustments, exhibit low profitability, have high debt, experience significant year-over-year profitability changes, or have a high share of group charges. Common errors include failing to prepare Local Files, improperly identifying homogeneous transactions, and neglecting to document free services.<br><br>Taxpayers often have queries about reorganization processes subject to documentation and how to perform comparative analysis. The penalties for non-compliance with transfer pricing documentation are among the most restrictive in Europe.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full463" style="display:none;">Most taxpayers encounter situations requiring them to issue or receive corrective invoices (adjusting invoices) for goods or services. These corrections can stem from various reasons such as price errors, discrepancies in the quantity of goods, or discounts. The question then arises: when can VAT be deducted from these corrective invoices?<br><br>Before 2021, the process was straightforward for "minus" corrections: the taxpayer signed and returned the invoice, and the seller accounted for VAT upon receiving it. There were no regulations for "plus" corrections, the practice depended on the cause of the correction.<br><br>Since 2021, the SLIM VAT package introduced changes, emphasizing the need for documentation confirming agreed-upon correction terms and their fulfillment. Agreements can be documented through contracts, amendments, emails, or seller's website terms.<br><br>For sellers issuing "minus" corrective invoices, the correction is accounted for when the invoice is issued, provided documentation confirms agreed terms. Without this documentation, the correction is only included in the JPK declaration for the period the documentation is obtained. For "plus" corrections, the adjustment is made in the period the correction's cause occurred, whether it's an initial error, corrected retroactively to the original period, or a secondary cause, accounted for in the current period.<br><br>Buyers receiving "minus" corrections must also possess documentation confirming agreed terms with the seller, accounting for the correction in the period they obtain this documentation, provided the original invoice was recorded. For "plus" corrections, the input VAT can be deducted in the period the corrective invoice is received or in the subsequent three periods.</p>

      <h2>Reporting tax schemes - return</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full465" style="display:none;">Polish tax law requires businesses to report tax schemes, a regulation introduced in 2019 but temporarily suspended during the pandemic. These regulations are expected to return, and failure to comply can result in significant penalties. A tax scheme is an arrangement, whether current or future, involving at least one taxpayer, designed to create a tax advantage through deliberate utilization of available tools. This applies to both domestic and cross-border transactions.<br><br>The reporting obligation falls on promoters (those who design and implement the scheme), beneficiaries (those who benefit from the scheme), and supporting entities (those involved in its development or supervision). Identifying when a scheme arises is complex, requiring careful documentation. All involved parties must be notified.<br><br>Internal procedures for managing tax schemes are mandatory for entities meeting the definition of promoters and those employing or compensating promoters. Such entities must also exceed a revenue or cost threshold of 8,000,000 PLN in the preceding year.<br><br>Ambiguities exist regarding which transactions require reporting, such as operational leasing agreements. While a leasing agreement may satisfy a general hallmark from the lessor's perspective, whether the lessee achieves a tax benefit is assessed on the particulars of the case.<br><br>Ultimately, businesses must continuously monitor and analyze their activities to ensure compliance with evolving reporting requirements. The complexity of these regulations increases the likelihood of encountering reportable events or transactions.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full467" style="display:none;">The article discusses the financial, tax, social security contribution, and enforcement implications of gift vouchers provided to employees in Poland.<br><br>Gift vouchers can be financed from two sources: the company's operating funds or the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS). When financed from operating funds, all employees can receive vouchers of equal value. ZFŚS-funded vouchers are subject to regulations that consider the employee's life situation. Vouchers from the employer's own funds are treated differently.<br><br>Gift vouchers are considered income for employees and are subject to income tax. Vouchers purchased with the employer's own funds are subject to inheritance and donation tax if the value exceeds the tax-free amount.<br><br>Social security and health insurance contributions depend on the funding source. Vouchers from operating funds are subject to contributions like regular salary. ZFŚS-funded vouchers are exempt from contributions if they constitute social assistance and are granted according to ZFŚS regulations. A similar exemption applies if the company has a social and welfare fund in place of ZFŚS.<br><br>Benefits paid to employees from ZFŚS are subject to full enforcement. These benefits are not treated as wages. Enforcement requires a relevant enforcement title. Vouchers funded by the employer’s own resources are not subject to enforcement.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full468" style="display:none;">The project regarding collective labor disputes is currently under discussion with social partners in the Social Dialogue Council. A key aspect is introducing the concept of a "dominant employer," defined as an employer or entrepreneur who exerts significant influence over another employer or entrepreneur, particularly through ownership or organizational ties. This aims to address situations where the actual decision-maker isn't the direct employer, enabling collective bargaining with the entity holding real power over employee rights and working conditions.<br><br>The draft law also defines a collective labor dispute as a disagreement between employees and employers concerning collective rights, freedoms, or interests related to employment. It stipulates that multiple unions must form a joint representation for negotiations. The proposed law limits the duration of a dispute to nine months, extendable by agreement to twelve, after which it must conclude with an agreement, a record of disagreements followed by a vote and strike, or it expires. To reinforce mediation, the project aims to enhance the standards and requirements for mediators and maintain a public list of mediators managed by the minister. A party requesting mediation must inform the other party and include a record of disagreements. Preventive mediation is also introduced to de-escalate conflicts during negotiations.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full470" style="display:none;">The obligation to pay withholding tax on income earned in Poland applies to both residents and non-residents. Withholding tax (WHT) is a flat tax on income for individuals and legal entities who are non-residents, specifically when they earn income in Poland. The Polish payer is responsible for withholding and remitting this tax. Certain situations may also require Polish residents to pay WHT, such as dividend payments to domestic entities.<br><br>WHT applies to intangible services and income derived from interest, royalties, rights to inventions, trademarks, designs, as well as fees for using industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, know-how, and services related to entertainment or sports performed by foreign entities. It also covers fees for cargo and passenger transport by foreign shipping companies from Polish ports (excluding transit), income of foreign airlines from Polish operations (excluding scheduled passenger transport), and dividends or other profit distributions. The scope can be influenced by double taxation treaties.<br><br>Key considerations for WHT include exercising due diligence when withholding tax or applying reduced rates/exemptions. This involves verifying document accuracy, the recipient's tax residency, and the counterparty's status as a taxpayer. Confirming beneficial ownership, meaning the recipient is the true owner of the income and conducts genuine business activity, is also crucial for tax preferences.<br><br>The "pay and refund" mechanism allows for tax withholding and subsequent refund requests. A 2,000,000 PLN limit applies to payments of WHT-liable income to the same taxpayer. Exceeding this limit requires withholding the statutory rate (19% or 20%). Refunds can be claimed by the taxpayer or payer, with a typical verification period of six months, potentially extending to nine. Failure to refund within the statutory period incurs interest. Tax authorities may approve or deny refund requests through a decision, which can be appealed. The complexity of WHT, especially regarding due diligence and verification, often leads to disputes.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full472" style="display:none;">More and more companies are expanding their marketing activities in the age of social media, AI, and innovations to stay competitive and maximize profits. This raises questions about taxation across various marketing forms implemented by Polish businesses.<br><br>Small value gifts and samples, as defined by VAT law, may be subject to specific regulations depending on their value and record-keeping. Gifts below a certain value (100 PLN annually per person if records are kept, or 20 PLN per item if not) can be treated differently. Sample goods of small amount that demonstrate a product’s features are subject to specific documentations linking the item with increasing the company's revenue.<br><br>Advertising expenses are generally tax-deductible as they aim to generate income. This includes costs for sponsored social media content, TV ads, banners, and posters, and VAT can be deducted from these expenses.<br><br>Representation expenses, aimed at creating a positive image, are generally not tax-deductible, although the deduction of VAT is possible. The director of National Fiscal Information agreed in the individual interpretation issued on August 18, 2017, confirming the possibility of deducting input tax related to representation expenses.<br><br>In summary, companies should be aware of tax regulations related to their marketing activities. Depending on the type of marketing activity, there may be tax obligations related to VAT or income tax. It's important to consult tax authorities' opinions, explanations, judgments, and interpretations.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full473" style="display:none;">In theory, VAT covers the paid supply of goods and services within the country. However, unpaid services can also be taxable. When providing unpaid services to employees, it's crucial to understand the VAT implications. VAT applies to paid supply of goods, services, exports, imports, and intra-community transactions. The transfer of the right to dispose of goods as an owner, including free transfers and consumption for personal use by the taxpayer or employees, is considered a taxable supply of goods if the taxpayer had the right to deduct VAT. Unpaid services for personal use, including those for employees, are also taxable.<br><br>However, unpaid services not related to business activities are exempt. The connection between the service and the business is key. Employee accommodation is generally considered personal, but if necessary for work efficiency, it may not be taxable. This often depends on the necessity of lodging near the workplace, away from the employee's residence. Free transportation to work is usually taxable, unless it's the only way for employees to reach work, thus benefiting the employer's business. Gifts are exempt if of small value (up to 20 PLN) or, with proper records, up to 100 PLN per person per year. In conclusion, assess the primary purpose of unpaid services, ensuring it's linked to business operations rather than solely benefiting the employee personally, to determine VAT obligations.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full474" style="display:none;">The article discusses the transfer of gift vouchers and income tax implications, building upon a previous discussion of fundamental aspects.<br><br>Regarding voucher transfers, the VAT treatment depends on whether the voucher is for a single or multiple purposes. For single-purpose vouchers transferred by an intermediary on behalf of the issuer, the transfer is considered a supply of goods or services by the issuer. The distributor accounts for VAT on their intermediary services, while the issuer is liable for VAT on the voucher sale. Free transfers are treated as free supplies. If a foreign business without a presence in Poland transfers a single-purpose voucher to a Polish VAT payer, the Polish buyer is responsible for VAT if the supply location is in Poland.<br><br>For multi-purpose vouchers, when transferred by someone other than the issuer, only intermediary services like distribution or promotion are subject to VAT. The issuer is responsible for VAT when the vouchers are redeemed; the transfer to the distributor is not taxable.<br><br>Regarding income tax, revenue is recognized when goods are delivered or services are rendered, or at the latest, when an invoice is issued or payment is made, according to the Accounting Act and the Corporate Income Tax Act. Issuing a voucher doesn't create revenue, but redeeming it does, regardless of the voucher type. If a voucher expires unused, revenue is recognized on the expiration date.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full475" style="display:none;">Having experience as both an auditor working with Supervisory Boards and as a member of one, this article highlights key financial topics for Supervisory Boards to regularly discuss. These include:<br><br>**Margins, Profitability, and Break-Even Point:** Understanding the company's market (retail, wholesale, etc.) and tracking margins, sales profitability, and break-even points for new projects are crucial. Margin analysis reveals how much profit each sale generates and identifying downward trends is vital.<br><br>**Liquidity and Cash Resources:** Companies fail due to liquidity issues, not just lack of profit. Monitoring working capital, inventory turnover, and receivables collection is essential. Assessing liquidity ratios is also important, especially during annual reviews.<br><br>**Investments, Debt, and Capital Negotiations:** The Supervisory Board approves business strategy and related investments. Understanding the consequences of loans, debt agreements, and capital increases (interest rates, currency risk) is a must. Reviewing loan covenants is also critical.<br><br>**Internal Control Systems - Risks, New Operations, Fraud:** Supervisory Boards should actively engage with the COSO framework. It's important to review the internal control system annually, especially during rapid development. Implementing "four eyes principle" and reviewing management authority can support fraud detection.<br><br>**IT Systems - Business Continuity, Data Integration and Security:** Ensuring IT systems have backup plans, data is archived, and recovery tested are essential. Solving data integration problems leads to business success.<br><br>**Business Model and Changing Expectations (ESG):** Regularly testing the business model and comparing it to competitors can result in innovative activities and strengthen the business model. Furthermore, taking into account the impact of the organization on the ecosystem is increasingly important.<br><br>Ultimately, being a Supervisory Board member requires critical and non-linear thinking. Questioning assumptions to strengthen the organization and finding areas for improvement allows the business to develop more strongly.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full476" style="display:none;">Succession, or inheritance, is a major challenge for family businesses. In Poland, these firms are categorized into five levels, from potentially family-owned (92% of family companies) to multi-generational (only 5%), with varying degrees of family involvement and succession planning.<br><br>Family businesses significantly impact the Polish economy, contributing a substantial portion of the GDP and export market. While they constitute the vast majority of Polish companies (92%), only a smaller percentage consider themselves as family businesses. Globally, they account for a significant share of GDP and employment.<br><br>Succession rates remain low, with only a fraction of family businesses successfully transitioning to the second or third generation. Many owners desire to pass the business to their descendants, but few successors are willing. A small percentage have formal succession plans. Cultural factors, like those in Asia, can positively influence long-term family business success, exemplified by the Hoshi Ryokan hotel in Japan.<br><br>Planning for succession is crucial for business survival, involving successor preparation and knowledge transfer. Open communication about expectations and needs is essential. Nurturing children to take over the family business requires unconditional love, problem-solving skills, and allowing independence.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full477" style="display:none;">SLIM VAT 3, a proposed amendment to VAT by the Polish Ministry of Finance, aims to simplify VAT accounting, improve financial liquidity for businesses, and streamline invoicing. Scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2023, it builds upon previous SLIM VAT packages from 2021, which addressed international transactions and VAT deduction deadlines.<br><br>SLIM VAT 3 includes raising the small taxpayer sales limit to 2 million euros, allowing VAT account funds to be used for retail sales tax, and eliminating the requirement to possess an invoice for intra-community acquisition of goods when deducting VAT. It also reduces the number of necessary adjustments, simplifies VAT accounting by waiving corrections if the difference between preliminary and final proportions doesn't exceed 2%, streamlines reporting for sales using cash registers, and unifies regulations for Binding Rate Information (WIS), Binding Tariff Information (WIT), Binding Excise Information (WIA) and Binding Origin Information (WIP). The fee for a WIS application will be abolished, and a spending review process will be implemented in public finance.<br><br>The package was also influenced by the CJEU ruling C-935/19, which calls for VAT sanctions to be proportionate to the nature of the offense. Sanctions will be applied at the authorities' discretion, based on the nature of the activity and taxpayer's due diligence. Maximum sanctions should be applied only in the case of tax fraud.</p>

They understand business, make sound decisions, and care about the organization. Communication and persuasion skills are vital, as is self-criticism. Crucially, they guide a team of diverse individuals, fostering their development, not just managing tasks. Being a good leader is challenging and not for everyone.<br><br>Contrary to the image of an infallible perfectionist, a good leader is not without flaws. Their strength lies in self-assessment, enabling continuous growth. Perfection isn't the goal; rather, it's about expanding knowledge and preventing stagnation within the team. If doubts exist about one's ability to guide others effectively, it's better to step aside. Leadership isn't necessarily teachable; some are naturally inclined, while others excel as experts. Combining both roles requires significant self-improvement and a commitment to learning.<br><br>Good leaders possess numerous qualities that aren't always easily learned, but are honed over time. They are multidimensional, creative, and knowledgeable, building teams that complement each other. They unite and motivate, communicate honestly about successes and failures, and sometimes act as mediators. Clear communication is essential, whether listening, advising, or making tough decisions.<br><br>Thirteen key traits of a good leader include: good leadership, honesty, respecting opinions, valuing others, asking questions instead of commanding, persuasiveness, offering approval, driving the team to success, trusting employees, active listening, clear communication, decisive decision-making, and commitment to continuous development. A good leader is also a good business partner, professional and transparent. Moore Polska offers individuals who understand and build empathetic client relationships.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full479" style="display:none;">Choosing the employment form for a management board member is a common dilemma for companies. A board member can act as a member of the governing body, a third party with a civil law contract, or a third party with an employment contract. Each form has specific tax implications and obligations to the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS). It's crucial to understand these options to make the most beneficial and secure choice.<br><br>Formal requirements for board members are outlined in the Commercial Companies Code, including full legal capacity and no criminal convictions for certain offenses. Employment options include appointment, employment contract, or civil law contract. The choice depends on factors like whether the member is a shareholder, the employment duration, and associated costs.<br><br>Appointment is often preferred for its simplicity. Until recently, it was attractive due to the lack of mandatory social security contributions, although health insurance is still required. Employment contracts are increasingly scrutinized by ZUS, requiring clear separation of duties and genuine positions within the company. Civil law contracts are considered safer from ZUS challenges, but their content must avoid resembling employment contracts to avoid similar social security obligations.<br><br>Board members are entitled to remuneration, usually determined by shareholder resolution for appointments and by contract terms for employment or civil law agreements. Termination can occur through dismissal, death, mandate expiration, or resignation. Resignations must be submitted to shareholders, and may result in liability for damages caused by sudden departure without a valid reason. Proper documentation of activities is crucial for potential audits.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full480" style="display:none;">Tax succession involves the transfer of rights and obligations from one entity to another resulting from a transformation or significant structural change in the original entity. It typically occurs when a sole proprietorship expands and becomes a company, or when an existing company undergoes changes in its legal form. Restructuring requires careful consideration of both organizational and tax consequences.<br><br>Company transformations are regulated in the commercial companies code, encompassing changes between different types of partnerships or capital companies. These modifications in legal form may be driven by the desire to alter the distribution of rights and obligations, organizational structure, business expansion, or mergers and acquisitions. Transforming a capital company into a partnership can be particularly complex due to the taxation of undistributed profits. Companies undergoing liquidation or bankruptcy cannot be transformed.<br><br>Tax succession resulting from company transformations is governed by the Tax Ordinance. The newly formed legal entity assumes all rights and obligations of the transformed company. In case of conflicting regulations between the general Tax Ordinance and specific tax laws, the latter prevails.<br><br>Transforming a sole proprietorship into a single-person capital company involves specific rules regarding tax succession, focusing on the succession of rights rather than obligations. This excludes the entrepreneur's personal liability for obligations.<br><br>In conclusion, company transformations result in new obligations stemming from tax succession as outlined in the Tax Ordinance. While transformations facilitate business expansion, it's essential to assess potential tax burdens and consequences.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full481" style="display:none;">In today's business environment, effective management requires more than just industry expertise. Leaders need a grasp of economics, business psychology, finance, law, and taxation. This multifaceted demand has led to a shift where managers and owners seek a "business partner" in their finance and accounting professionals. These partners, armed with the right knowledge, can simplify complex business realities into analyzable facts for management.<br><br>This article outlines key discussions between business owners, boards, and finance professionals who embrace the business partner role. A critical question managers often pose is, "Can we afford this?" This seemingly simple query triggers a deep dive into current financial health, profitability drivers, short-to-medium term forecasts, cash flow projections, and the allocation of any surplus funds.<br><br>A common source of frustration for executives is the disconnect between accounting profit and actual cash availability. This arises from the accrual basis of accounting (memoriał) versus the cash basis (kasowa). Accrual accounting recognizes revenue and expenses when earned or incurred, not necessarily when cash changes hands. For instance, sales are recorded upon delivery, not payment. Similarly, purchases with deferred payment terms impact cash later. VAT further complicates this by requiring payment on sales tax differences, irrespective of actual cash received.<br><br>A proficient financial analyst can bridge this gap by analyzing revenue-to-cash conversion rates and the timing of expenses. They connect profitability metrics with liquidity and working capital management, examining receivables, payables, and inventory. Understanding where a business earns the most is paramount for strategic resource allocation. Profitability, defined as the difference between selling price and costs, necessitates a granular understanding of all associated expenses. Pricing strategies are crucial; poorly set prices can lead to business failure.<br><br>Future-oriented questions about interest rates, currency exchange rates, and the cost of energy or raw materials are vital for planning. Financial directors and chief accountants monitor economic indicators to forecast future margins, profits, cash flows, and costs. While forecasts are not exact, they provide sufficient accuracy to navigate business operations and mitigate risks.<br><br>Regarding tax optimization, it's achievable but depends on an owner's risk appetite. While accountants are inherently cautious, business owners should collaborate on tax strategies, as interpretations and legal precedents evolve. Seeking external expertise can ensure optimal tax planning.<br><br>The decision between purchasing, leasing, or financing assets varies. While large corporations have centralized decisions, smaller entities benefit from expert financial advice tailored to their specific goals and financial position. Ultimately, a good financial partner, understanding the CEO's vision, can guide these crucial decisions, identifying both opportunities and risks within the business, thereby significantly influencing its successful development.<br><br>Contact: piotr.witek@moorepolska.pl</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full482" style="display:none;">Employee wellbeing encompasses more than just fair pay and benefits; it requires a holistic approach. It includes a positive work atmosphere, satisfactory compensation, and development opportunities. Beyond these, perks like team-building activities, relaxation areas, bonuses, and holiday gifts contribute. Ultimately, wellbeing is about an employee's overall quality of life, a concept particularly important for younger generations entering the workforce.<br><br>Gallup identifies five key elements of wellbeing: finding meaning in daily work, strong workplace relationships, financial security, good physical health, and a positive connection to one's community. Research indicates that healthy employees are significantly more productive, engaged, and have lower absenteeism rates.<br><br>Despite efforts, many companies struggle with employee wellbeing, often focusing on engagement metrics without genuine implementation. Common pitfalls include treating engagement as a mere survey or program rather than a continuous practice, prioritizing survey data over people development, and defining engagement as simply the absence of dissatisfaction instead of genuine enthusiasm. Companies also err by relying on metrics that provide flattering results rather than those that identify organizational issues.<br><br>The synergy between wellbeing and work-life balance hinges on employee appreciation. Recognized employees who feel valued are more productive. Fostering a sense of importance and belonging encourages employees to take on challenges and minimize errors. A company's commitment to wellbeing reflects its organizational culture, leading to happier, more productive employees, a better work-life balance, and attracting new talent, ultimately driving growth and success. Investing in employee wellbeing yields significant returns across multiple dimensions.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full483" style="display:none;">Development works have long been present in Polish balance sheets, with established knowledge and best practices now available. It's a misnomer to claim ignorance, as the landscape has significantly shifted. Striving to make development works a source of pride, not a weakness, is achievable. Tools exist to support this, including grant agreements from entities like NCBR, which often necessitate revenue forecasts, success criteria, and TRL scale assessments.<br><br>Development works remain a challenging asset due to specific accounting requirements lacking practical examples, the inherent variability of R&D projects, skepticism from auditors and external users, significant asset values attracting scrutiny, reliance on estimates increasing error risk, and potential misuse for artificial profit enhancement by deferring current costs. This often leads to analysts treating these assets as worthless.<br><br>Five common myths CFOs fall for regarding development works include: viewing them as a quick profitability booster, which can mask liquidity issues and lead to over-investment; extending amortization periods, creating a ticking time bomb for future write-downs; believing no one will notice these significant balance sheet items; assuming no one knows how to properly account for them, despite available tools and guidance; and accepting the notion that development works are inherently fraudulent, which is untrue unless misused for financial misrepresentation. Proper management and use of tools can ensure development works are a strength.<br><br>Development works, when managed correctly, represent genuine investment that should yield returns, not a tool for financial manipulation. Companies whose core business relies on internally developed technology are adept at managing these investments, using available tools to monitor progress and profitability. The aim should be to ensure development works are a point of pride in financial statements, not a vulnerability.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full484" style="display:none;">Gift vouchers are commonly understood by consumers as a way to acquire goods or services without depleting their personal budget. However, for a voucher to be received, it must first be issued and enter circulation. This introduces the issuer, a business entity, which must account for gift vouchers as economic events.<br><br>This article delves into gift vouchers, focusing on their legal essence, types, and accounting treatment, including VAT. A voucher is legally defined by the VAT Act as consideration for the supply of goods or services, where these items or their suppliers can be identified. Vouchers are payment instruments, distinct from discount cards.<br><br>The VAT Act distinguishes two types of vouchers: single-purpose vouchers, where the place of supply, services, and VAT amount are known at issuance, and multi-purpose vouchers, where at least one of these elements is unknown at issuance. Issuing a voucher means its first introduction into circulation, while issuance and subsequent transfers are considered voucher transfers. Vouchers can be physical or electronic, paid or free.<br><br>From a VAT perspective, the tax obligation is crucial. While issuing a voucher does not create a tax obligation, its redemption does. Vouchers are initially recorded as deferred revenue. The distinction between single-purpose and multi-purpose vouchers is key for VAT. For single-purpose vouchers, VAT is due upon sale; for multi-purpose vouchers, VAT is due upon redemption. Small taxpayers using the cash method are exempt from VAT on single-purpose voucher transactions. Income tax related to vouchers will be covered in a subsequent part.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full485" style="display:none;">The Estonian CIT, or lump-sum CIT on company income, shifts taxation from the difference between taxable revenue and costs to the taxation of accounting profit upon profit distribution. While it simplifies accounting, it requires initial obligations. Companies adopting Estonian CIT for 2023 must present specific equity items in their December 31, 2022 balance sheets: undistributed and distributed profits earned before the first year of lump-sum taxation, and uncovered losses from prior years. Standard balance sheet templates may not accommodate these, but greater detail is permissible per accounting law.<br><br>A preliminary adjustment is necessary to reconcile tax and accounting results. This involves including accounting revenues not recognized as taxable, and taxable costs not recognized as accounting costs, and vice versa. This adjustment may create a provisional liability that expires after four years of Estonian CIT application, classifying it as a contingent liability.<br><br>Companies under Estonian CIT must also disclose income from hidden profits in their financial statement footnotes. Additionally, deferred tax assets and provisions should be derecognized if the company is expected to continue with Estonian CIT, as they won't be utilized in tax settlements, impacting the preceding year's financial results.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full489" style="display:none;">This article explains the importance of a "accounting policy" document for businesses, especially when their accounting is handled by external parties. The Polish Accounting Act mandates that companies keeping full accounting records must have a written accounting policy. This document details how a company will conduct its accounting, including its financial year, reporting periods, valuation methods for assets and liabilities, how financial results are determined, and the principles for keeping books, such as the chart of accounts and classification of economic events. It also specifies data protection systems for accounting evidence.<br><br>The law outlines key elements for the accounting policy, but it's not exhaustive. The policy should be tailored to the specific nature of the business and may include methodologies for documenting operations, inventory principles, accruals, provisions, receivables valuation, inventory accounting, fixed asset registration and depreciation, and document archiving. The article criticizes the common mistake of treating the accounting policy as a mere formality. It highlights that the company's Head is ultimately responsible for this document, but the accountant's expertise in accounting methods and system limitations is crucial. Collaboration between the Head and accounting services is vital to ensure the accounting reflects the company's strategy and adapts to changes.<br><br>Changes to the accounting policy are necessary due to external economic factors, legal changes, or the company's decision to alter accounting simplifications or adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The accounting policy also forms part of the annual financial statement introduction. In essence, a well-defined accounting policy organizes a company's operations, aids accounting services, and ensures the quality of financial reports, providing clarity to auditors and regulatory bodies.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full492" style="display:none;">Companies often express gratitude to employees or contractors through gifts or gift cards, funded from company operating funds or the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS). This can have tax implications. The source of funding impacts the tax treatment of gifts for employees. Gifts to employees from operating funds are generally considered income from employment, subject to income tax and social security contributions (ZUS), except for gifts of small value (under 100 PLN per year). Gifts funded from ZFŚS are tax-free up to 1000 PLN per year, above which they are taxable income but not subject to ZUS contributions. Employee benefits within a motivation system are treated as monetary equivalents, subject to income tax and ZUS.<br><br>Gift cards for employees and contractors are generally not considered tax-deductible expenses for the company, as they are viewed as donations. Gifts to business partners, lacking a promotional purpose, are also not deductible. Gifts received by B2B partners are treated as business income, with the partner responsible for taxes. VAT obligations may arise when giving gifts to contractors, unless they are of small value and related to the company's business. Companies were previously required to file PIT-8AR forms for gifts to contractors, but are now obligated to show the benefit in PIT-11. No declaration is needed for small-value gifts. Tax analysis of funding sources can lead to tax optimization for both employers and employees.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full494" style="display:none;">As a manager of an accounting firm with 250 employees, the author often gets asked how to find good accountants. A good accountant helps the company navigate regulations, meets deadlines, optimizes taxes, and provides good reporting. While recruitment mishaps sometimes occur, they are quickly resolved. The author identifies two main paths to becoming a good accountant, both requiring a mentor. Theoretical knowledge alone is insufficient. A mentor provides experience, knowledge, and understands client expectations, guiding the mentee through various tasks and providing support.<br><br>The first path involves working in a specialized accounting firm, gaining experience in diverse tasks for multiple clients across various industries. This allows for rapid professional growth, especially when supplemented with training. These individuals often become chief accountants or financial directors due to their broad understanding of accounting principles and risk management. The second path involves working within the accounting department of a specific company, which provides in-depth industry knowledge but may limit exposure to a wide range of accounting challenges. Additional training can compensate for this.<br><br>Regardless of the path, a good accountant works efficiently and prioritizes tasks to meet management's needs. Soft skills, especially communication, are essential for building relationships with clients, managers, and colleagues. In conclusion, a career in accounting offers intellectual and communication challenges, leading to satisfaction and fulfillment, especially with the opportunity to become a certified auditor.</p>

The amount of wage subsidies depends on the degree of disability, with increased support for employees with mental impairments. Recent legislation increases monthly subsidies, up to 2400 PLN for significantly disabled individuals. Employers must not have outstanding liabilities to PFRON and must register employees in the Fund's records.<br><br>Hiring disabled individuals not only reduces PFRON contributions but also promotes social responsibility, enhances the company's image, and fosters a loyal and effective workforce. Disabled employees are entitled to additional rights, including reduced working hours, additional leave, and paid time off for rehabilitation and medical treatment. The legal basis is the Act on Vocational and Social Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

Optional since 2022 alongside paper and electronic invoices, it will become mandatory on July 1, 2024, according to the Ministry of Finance.<br><br>Active VAT taxpayers with a registered office or fixed place of business in Poland will be obligated to use KSeF. VAT-exempt entrepreneurs may also be required, but with a delayed implementation deadline of January 1, 2025.<br><br>KSeF primarily covers B2B sales transactions, excluding B2C documents like consumer invoices (replacing fiscal receipts with customer data but without a VAT number) and toll road tickets.<br><br>Businesses can prepare for KSeF using software provided by the Ministry of Finance or commercial alternatives. A test version is currently available on the Ministry's website.<br><br>Benefits of KSeF include faster VAT refunds (40 days instead of 60), standardized documentation, no need for taxpayers to store invoices, easier accounting, and exemption from sending JPK_FA files. KSeF also enables self-billing, allowing sellers to authorize buyers to issue invoices.<br><br>Failure to implement KSeF by July 1, 2024, may result in penalties, potentially up to 100% of the tax amount on the invoice, or 18.7% of the amount due if no tax is shown. However, the Ministry of Finance plans to postpone sanctions for errors until 2025.<br><br>KSeF aims to streamline invoicing, reducing the burden on businesses. Digitization offers benefits such as faster VAT refunds and eliminating the need for document storage. Early preparation is recommended to familiarize oneself with the system's functionalities and adapt to the changes.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full499" style="display:none;">Technological progress and the emergence of new services are increasing the frequency of licensing. Licensing involves the licensor transferring rights to intangible assets, specifically granting the licensee the right to use software for further exploitation, constituting a service.<br><br>Tax authorities have interpreted licensing differently over the years. Initially, it was often seen as a continuous service, with the tax obligation arising based on payment schedules. However, in 2017, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that a license, regardless of duration, is not a continuous service. Now, tax obligations are generally recognized based on standard principles. This is reinforced by individual interpretations, indicating an emerging consensus against classifying licenses as continuous services.<br><br>Under VAT law, the tax obligation arises upon service completion. If no invoice has been issued or partial payment made, the tax obligation and revenue recognition occur on the date of delivery of the object of the agreement. In the case of a license, it is the date of transfer, confirmed by both parties, often through a transfer protocol. If the license is conditional upon payment, the tax obligation arises upon receipt of that payment.<br><br>Regarding corporate income tax (CIT), revenue is generally recognized on the date of item delivery, asset disposal, or service performance, but no later than the date of invoice issuance or payment settlement. Thus, the revenue recognition moment is typically the date the license/software rights are transferred, confirmed by both parties.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full500" style="display:none;">Work on the law regarding family foundations is nearing completion, potentially enabling the establishment of the first family foundations in the first half of 2023. A family foundation manages a family business's assets, securing the wealth for designated individuals, usually family, and facilitating business succession. It aims to protect family business assets upon the owner's retirement or passing, ensure family harmony to prevent business disruption, ease succession, and prevent asset fragmentation, ensuring the continuity of the family enterprise.<br><br>Foundations can be established by multiple individuals, including non-relatives, and kinship between founder and beneficiary isn't required. Taxation is family-relationship based, often tax-neutral. PIT exemptions apply to benefits and assets acquired from the foundation by the founder, spouse, ancestors, descendants, siblings, stepchildren, stepparents, or stepmothers. Others pay 15% PIT. CIT exemption applies to revenue from specified business activities; otherwise, a 25% CIT rate applies. A 15% CIT is levied when distributing funds to beneficiaries upon the foundation's dissolution. Establishing and transferring assets to the foundation is exempt from CIT and PCC taxes.<br><br>Family foundations cannot utilize the Estonian CIT taxation model for companies in which they hold shares. Inheritances and donations received from the family foundation are subject to income tax on individuals and are not subject to inheritance or donation tax. It benefits those wanting to maintain a family business across generations, protect assets, and generate profits for beneficiaries' upkeep. Tax advantages exist for founders and beneficiaries, with PIT exemptions for close family members. Favorable CIT conditions are introduced, with specified business activities exempt. CIT is levied at 15% only upon distribution to beneficiaries.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full501" style="display:none;">Many entrepreneurs question the necessity of engaging with accounting firms and how to choose one. Remote work, document digitization, and automation have blurred geographical limitations. Shared service centers in Poland handle accounting for companies across the globe, proving that businesses of any size can be served remotely.<br><br>The price of accounting services depends on factors such as the type of business, accounting methods, document volume, business complexity, accounting system, and reporting requirements. Sole proprietorships using simplified accounting methods like a flat-rate tax are the simplest and cheapest, while corporations using full accounting books are more complex and expensive. The number and complexity of documents significantly affect the price, with high-volume, complex businesses incurring higher fees.<br><br>Business complexity, measured by the number of cost centers, reporting requirements, and the type of financial system used (SAP, Oracle, etc.), also drives costs. Automation and streamlined data transfer can reduce expenses, as human labor is the costliest. Ultimately, accounting firms sell their time, and clients can expect to pay from a few hundred to thousands of zlotys per month. While value-added services exist, clients often focus on hourly rates. Prestige, experience, customer service, and advice quality are also factored into the final price.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full502" style="display:none;">Decision-making is crucial in professional life, and effective leaders make sound choices to avoid negative consequences. Decision-making involves gathering and processing information to select a course of action. This process can be challenging, demanding analytical skills to discard flawed options and make informed choices.<br><br>The difficulty in decision-making stems from the responsibility it entails, accepting both success and failure. Fear of failure, especially in business where one is accountable for the company's image, budget, and personnel, often hinders decision-making. Other factors include perfectionism, fear of disapproval, lack of self-confidence, a narrow perspective, and insufficient knowledge.<br><br>To make effective decisions, practice is essential. Experience, knowledge, and past situations provide valuable insights. Analyzing past decisions, both successful and unsuccessful, helps identify strengths and weaknesses. The process begins with defining the problem and setting clear goals. Considering different perspectives, analyzing the situation, seeking alternatives, identifying uncertainties, and anticipating future consequences are crucial.<br><br>Good leaders avoid emotional influences like fear or personal preferences. Their focus should be on the company's and team's well-being, guiding their decisions. While time constraints sometimes require quick decisions, the ability to make them can be developed. Overcoming the fear of responsibility is the first step.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full504" style="display:none;">The amended Labor Code allows employers to conduct preventive alcohol testing of employees if it's necessary to protect the life, health, or property of employees or others. Employers decide if the testing is justified and define its scope in collective agreements, work regulations, or announcements, specifying the affected employee groups, testing methods, device type, timing, and frequency. Employees must be informed at least two weeks before testing begins, and new hires must be informed before starting work.<br><br>Testing involves non-laboratory methods using calibrated devices to determine alcohol presence. An alcohol concentration of 0.1 to 0.25 mg/dm3 in exhaled air is considered being after alcohol use, exceeding 0.25 mg/dm3 indicates intoxication. Testing must respect employee dignity. Positive test results or suspicion of intoxication prevent an employee from working, with notification provided. Employees can request a separate test by law enforcement if they disagree with the results.<br><br>Information about testing and positive results can be stored for up to one year, or longer if it's evidence in legal proceedings involving the employer. Reporting to work intoxicated or consuming alcohol at work can lead to fines, disciplinary action, or termination. These regulations also apply to individuals working under civil law contracts and self-employed individuals.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full505" style="display:none;">Lean management originated in the 1940s, inspired by post-World War II Japanese automotive industry practices, particularly at Toyota. John Krafcik coined the term "lean production" in the late 1980s, contrasting Toyota's production system with traditional mass production. Lean emphasizes eliminating waste ("muda"), synchronizing processes for "just-in-time" delivery, preventing errors ("poka-yoke"), and continuous improvement ("kaizen").<br><br>Lean thinking involves defining value, identifying the value stream, ensuring continuous flow, implementing a pull system (delivering services only when needed), and striving for excellence. This approach reduces costs, improves efficiency, and maximizes employee potential, ultimately enhancing competitiveness. Simulation games, like "Architeka," help employees understand and implement lean principles.<br><br>Moore Polska has embraced lean management to improve service delivery. Internal trainers use the "Architeka" game to educate employees about Lean Service, aiming to enhance process efficiency. Workshops have been conducted across Moore Polska's offices, training 120 employees. The company believes that lean management and a well-trained team lead to better client service. Modern organizations adopt lean principles to address challenges in a volatile business environment, as traditional methods are no longer sufficient. Moore Polska fosters this culture and positions itself as a partner that understands and utilizes processes effectively.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full506" style="display:none;">The concept of work-life balance arises from increasing conflicts between work and personal life. In today's dynamic world, it's often overlooked. People mistakenly believe that consistent hours equal balance, which is frequently an illusion. True harmony exists when we fully engage at work without dwelling on personal matters, and vice versa.<br><br>To nurture ourselves, grow, and enjoy life, time is crucial. Organizing it, dividing the day into personal and professional spheres, is key. Lists and schedules help categorize tasks, prioritizing the most important. Systematically addressing these tasks is vital. Self-control and responsibility boost motivation. Ideally, employers offer flexible yet consistent work hours, accommodating "owls" and "larks."<br><br>The article argues that work and life shouldn't be an "either/or" choice, but rather intertwined. Fulfillment at work positively impacts our mental state, leading to happiness and stability in both domains. It's about living purposefully in both spheres, focusing on enjoyable activities and finding joy in personal time, free from career thoughts. Rest and relaxation enable us to approach work with renewed energy.<br><br>Work-life balance means recognizing that partial focus hinders productivity, leading to dissatisfaction and exhaustion. This creates a cycle of overwork and stress. Ultimately, it's about aligning and balancing personal and professional life to maximize effectiveness in each. This minimizes conflicts, allowing us to fully dedicate ourselves to one sphere at a time.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full507" style="display:none;">Sometimes a simple conversation can turn into an argument. The words we use and the tone in which we speak influence how we are perceived. The sender of a message can inadvertently create communication noise, leading to misunderstandings.<br><br>Encoding is the process of translating information into a message, using symbols that represent concepts and meanings, which can take the form of words or gestures. When encoding, the sender decides what information to convey, influenced by factors like age, gender, position, environment, culture, and lifestyle. These factors can cause the same information to be conveyed differently by different people.<br><br>To improve communication, one must learn to "read" people and understand their perspective. When encoding messages, senders should use symbols that are familiar to the target audience. Effective encoding involves conveying information clearly and simply, and anticipating and eliminating potential misunderstandings. A good leader doesn't make assumptions without knowing the details or speaking on topics they don't fully understand. They avoid assuming their understanding or style will be universally applicable. Instead, they understand their audience and tailor their messages accordingly.<br><br>To be understood, one must understand their own emotions and focus on "I" statements to express feelings and needs clearly, avoiding veiled problems. Careful consideration of what and how to say something is crucial, as is avoiding embellishment, digression, or rambling. Body language also encodes the message, indicating respect or disregard for the receiver.<br><br>Simple communication is essential in the workplace, but clarity and simplicity should not come at the expense of politeness. A good leader knows how to speak elegantly while ensuring their message is fully understood. Being misunderstood is detrimental, especially in business.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full508" style="display:none;">Estonian CIT is gaining popularity, but taxpayers still have doubts about its practical application. One such area is the mixed use of company cars by employees, which is subject to varying interpretations by tax authorities and administrative courts. Currently, there isn't a unified legal precedent. Tax authorities often draw an analogy to hidden profits, suggesting that 50% of the expenses related to mixed-use cars should be treated as non-business expenses subject to CIT.<br><br>However, a ruling by the Provincial Administrative Court in Gdańsk offered a contrasting view, stating that companies under Estonian CIT don't need to pay tax on expenses from mixed-use cars, as long as the employee is not a shareholder. The court argued that without a specific law, there's no basis for taxation.<br><br>From January 1, 2023, an amendment to the CIT law clarifies this, stating that 50% of expenses related to cars not exclusively used for business purposes will be considered non-business expenses. While interpretation issues currently exist, the January 2023 amendment is expected to resolve them.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full511" style="display:none;">Choosing the Estonian CIT for a company does not exempt it from applying transfer pricing regulations.<br><br>The Director of the National Tax Information (KIS) confirmed this in an individual interpretation dated July 1, 2022 (0111-KDIB2-1-4010-99-2022-1-PB). The company, which had opted for the Estonian CIT, questioned whether transfer pricing rules applied to them, believing the chapter on Estonian CIT in the CIT Act did not refer to them.<br><br>However, the KIS Director clarified that while the Estonian CIT exempts companies from certain CIT Act regulations, it does not affect transfer pricing rules. No provision suggests that companies using the Estonian CIT are exempt from transfer pricing obligations.<br><br>This position is further supported by tax explanations in the Ministry of Finance's Guide to the Estonian CIT (December 23, 2021). Section 1.4 of the guide states that the CIT Act's provisions do not exclude the application of all separate tax obligations, specifically mentioning transfer pricing and withholding tax. Therefore, companies under the Estonian CIT regime must still comply with these regulations.<br><br>In summary, companies that choose the Estonian CIT regime remain obligated to adhere to transfer pricing rules and fulfill all related tax duties, including preparing transfer pricing documentation when required by law.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full512" style="display:none;">Linguist Katarzyna Kłosińska distinguishes between "hearing" (passive reception of sounds) and "listening" (active engagement and reflection). The text emphasizes that true listening goes beyond words, involving observation of posture, gestures, and emotional regulation, as highlighted by Malcolm Forbes as the foundation of conversation. Conflicts often arise from a lack of deep listening, whereas understanding another's perspective can foster easy agreement. This empathetic listening is not innate but a learned skill crucial for effective communication in both personal and professional life.<br><br>Good leaders understand that clear communication, achieved through mastering listening, is vital for team success. They recognize that making others feel heard increases the likelihood of their own messages being understood, leading to greater clarity in directives and understanding of employee needs. Effective leaders avoid pretending to listen, listening solely to defend their own position, or filtering out information. Instead, they practice empathetic listening to fully grasp the speaker's intentions, personality, and context, becoming better mentors and fostering strong business relationships.</p>

      <h2>NFRD and CSRD Directives</h2>

      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full513" style="display:none;">The Non-financial Disclosure Reporting Directive (NFRD) was an early step towards non-financial reporting, requiring large public interest entities with over 500 employees to disclose information on environmental, social, and employee matters, human rights, anti-corruption, and bribery. This directive allowed for significant interpretation. In Poland, the NFRD was implemented through an amendment to the Accounting Act in 2016, affecting entities with over 500 employees and meeting specific asset or revenue thresholds. The first reporting year under these requirements in Poland was 2017.<br><br>Due to a lack of standardized rules and comparability issues with NFRD reports, the European Commission introduced the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in April 2021. The CSRD mandates several key reporting obligations for companies. These include conducting a materiality assessment based on a two-way materiality principle, preparing reports according to the unified European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), analyzing and including information on the company's alignment with the EU Taxonomy, presenting reports in XHTML format with proper tagging, and undergoing an audit by an independent, authorized entity. The CSRD aims to cover a broader range of entities than the NFRD. The development of the ESRS is being led by the EFRAG Project Task Force, with the standards comprising 13 documents covering general principles, cross-cutting indicators, environmental, social and governance matters. Auditors and other certified assurance service providers will verify these reports.<br><br>The Non-financial Disclosure Reporting Directive (NFRD) was an initial European Union directive requiring large public interest entities to report on non-financial matters like environmental, social, and employee issues, human rights, and corruption. While it laid the groundwork for such reporting, it offered considerable room for interpretation. Poland implemented NFRD through its Accounting Act, impacting companies exceeding specific employee and financial thresholds. The subsequent Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), introduced due to the NFRD's limitations in standardization and comparability, significantly expands these requirements. The CSRD mandates companies to conduct materiality assessments, report using the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), detail their alignment with the EU Taxonomy, use a standardized XHTML format, and have their reports audited. The ESRS, developed by EFRAG, cover a comprehensive range of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics. The CSRD aims for broader coverage and more rigorous, comparable reporting to enhance transparency in sustainability matters.</p>

      <h2>Estonian CIT – Ineffective Tax Choice</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full514" style="display:none;">The Director of the National Revenue Information confirmed that a company that did not meet all the conditions for choosing Estonian CIT on the day of submitting the ZAW-RD notification did not effectively choose this form of taxation. Consequently, the company does not have to wait 3 years to resubmit the relevant notification.<br><br>This article highlights an individual interpretation from October 12, 2022, issued by the Director of the National Revenue Information (0111-KDIB1-1.4010.482.2022.1.AW), which addresses this specific issue.<br><br>The company stated it submitted the ZAW-RD notification to opt for the lump-sum corporate income tax regime, effective from April 1, 2022. Despite prior analysis of the eligibility criteria, professional advice revealed that not all conditions were met. The company is now working to adjust its business model to qualify for Estonian CIT.<br><br>The company questioned whether its ZAW-RD notification had any legal effect and if it was now free to resubmit the notification before the three-year penalty period expired.<br><br>The Director of KIS clarified that a company can effectively resubmit the ZAW-RD notification before the three-year period, which is a penalty for those who lose this tax option. Crucially, if a company did not meet all the necessary prerequisites for Estonian CIT at the time of submission or the intended start date, its notification was not effective, and thus it never acquired the right to this tax regime. Therefore, it can resubmit the ZAW-RD notification before the three-year sanction period has elapsed.<br><br>The key takeaway is that a company failing to meet the conditions for Estonian CIT when filing the ZAW-RD notification or on the intended start date does not lose the right to this tax regime because it never acquired it in the first place. This allows for the resubmission of the ZAW-RD notification before the three-year penalty period.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full515" style="display:none;">This article, following a previous one on ESG, discusses whether ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) represents an opportunity or a threat for financial market participants. It highlights that ESG implementation will bring significant changes, requiring reporting entities to acquire new competencies and tools. Audit committees and regulatory bodies like the Ministry of Finance and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority will also need ESG-trained personnel for effective oversight.<br><br>Globally, 75% of companies are reportedly unprepared for comprehensive ESG adoption. However, customer surveys indicate strong support for sustainable practices, with many willing to pay more for products from environmentally conscious companies. Ignoring ESG principles is deemed unprofitable, hindering growth and leading to stagnation for unadaptable organizations. Younger generations entering the workforce are particularly attuned to environmental issues, offering significant potential for driving ESG initiatives.<br><br>The financial market is responding to these shifts, with specialized companies like EcoVadis emerging to measure sustainability readiness through multi-dimensional ratings. Banks play a crucial role as capital providers, facing demands to collect, aggregate, and analyze sustainability data. This will likely lead to preferential financing for companies with strong ESG performance, particularly in green industries and those pursuing decarbonization. Ultimately, ESG is presented not as a threat but as a long-term opportunity for businesses, regulators, and citizens. Europe is investing heavily in transforming its economy, with substantial EU funds and financial sector capital allocated for this purpose. Adapting to ESG requirements is crucial for success, with unpreparedness posing regulatory and reputational risks.</p>

      <h2>Another victory for CHF borrowers before the CJEU</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full516" style="display:none;">Banks on the defensive. Courts rule that borrowers do not have to repay franc loans when the bank set the franc exchange rate.<br><br>Polish courts are increasingly issuing rulings favorable to individuals who took out Swiss franc loans. The reason? Banks unfairly set franc exchange rates for repayment purposes. According to the courts, such agreements are invalid. As a result, borrowers can demand the refund of paid installments and do not have to pay banks additional remuneration for using the granted credit.<br><br>In one such case, the District Court for Warsaw-Śródmieście asked the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) whether, if an agreement made the repayment of a franc loan dependent on the bank's consent, the court could independently remove such a provision. Banks argued that this would render the rest of the agreement valid, meaning the borrower could continue repaying the loan, but at official exchange rates set by the National Bank of Poland.<br><br>The CJEU has taken a clear stance, maintaining its pro-consumer approach in franc loan cases. It ruled that courts cannot remove clauses from loan agreements that require the bank's consent for repayment at unfair exchange rates and simultaneously automatically introduce an obligation to repay at official NBP exchange rates. Such a solution would impose no penalty on banks for using unfair clauses and would excessively interfere with the contract's terms.<br><br>Furthermore, the CJEU established that the statute of limitations for consumers' financial claims against banks should be calculated from the moment the consumer becomes aware that the agreement or its specific terms are unfair.<br><br>However, some issues remain unresolved. One such issue is the banks' right to remuneration for borrowers' use of borrowed money. While courts mostly deny banks this additional remuneration, the CJEU is currently considering this matter, with a ruling expected in 2023.<br><br>Banks are facing increased pressure from legal challenges to Swiss franc loans due to unfair exchange rate practices. Polish courts are siding with borrowers, often declaring loan agreements invalid. The CJEU has reinforced this pro-consumer stance, ruling that unfair clauses cannot be simply removed and replaced with official exchange rates without penalizing the banks. The calculation of the statute of limitations for claims has also been clarified to begin when the consumer realizes the unfairness of the terms. A key outstanding issue concerns banks' entitlement to remuneration for the use of funds when loans are deemed invalid, a matter the CJEU is currently reviewing.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full518" style="display:none;">According to amendments to the Personal Income Tax and Corporate Income Tax laws effective January 1, 2022, depreciation is no longer allowed for residential buildings (including elevators), separate residential properties, cooperative ownership rights to apartments, and rights to single-family homes in housing cooperatives, if used for business or leased. However, a transitional provision allows taxpayers to deduct depreciation expenses for these assets if they were acquired or manufactured before January 1, 2022, but only until December 31, 2022.<br><br>A residential building purchased in January 2022 cannot be depreciated. If acquired in 2021, depreciation can be deducted until the end of 2022, but not after. This change has raised concerns about violating the principle of protecting acquired rights. Taxpayers argue for continued depreciation until full amortization, based on constitutional principles. Tax authorities disagree, deeming this position incorrect in individual interpretations.<br><br>Administrative courts align with tax authorities. A non-final ruling by the Provincial Administrative Court in Łódź (September 20, 2022) stated that an individual tax interpretation procedure cannot be used to challenge the compliance of tax regulations with the Constitution. Tax authorities lack the jurisdiction to assess constitutional compliance. Therefore, the court agreed that depreciation of residential properties purchased before January 1, 2022, can only be deducted until December 31, 2022, not until fully amortized. Neither the tax authority nor the Administrative Court can invalidate a law due to potential constitutional violations. This stance confirms the impossibility of disregarding the legal provision based on potential constitutional infringements.</p>

      <h2>Ukrainian Citizen and PIT</h2>
      <p class="date">08.11.2022</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full519" style="display:none;">Following the outbreak of war in Ukraine, many Ukrainian citizens have emigrated to Poland. A significant number of these individuals are approaching or have already exceeded the 183-day period of stay in Poland. Some refugees continue to work for their previous Ukrainian employers. This raises the question of whether these individuals are obligated to pay Polish income tax.<br><br>The Polish Personal Income Tax (PIT) Act, specifically Article 3(1) and 1a(2), states that individuals residing in Poland are subject to unlimited tax liability on all their income, regardless of where it was earned. Residence is established if a person stays in Poland for over 183 days in a tax year. However, these provisions are subject to double taxation avoidance treaties.<br><br>According to Article 15(2) of the double taxation treaty with Ukraine, remuneration earned by a resident of one contracting state from employment exercised in another contracting state is taxable only in the first state if: (a) the recipient stays in the second state for no more than 183 days in a calendar year, (b) the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in the second state, and (c) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment of the employer in the second state.<br><br>Therefore, if a Ukrainian citizen stays in Poland for over 183 days and earns income from employment for a Ukrainian employer not having a seat in Poland, this income is fully taxable in Poland. While some experts suggest that the 183-day period should be suspended due to the war preventing return to Ukraine, this interpretation lacks legal basis and could have adverse consequences.<br><br>According to Article 44(1a)(1) and (3a) of the PIT Act, taxpayers receiving income from abroad without an intermediary are obliged to pay advance tax payments themselves. These payments are due by the 20th of the month following the income receipt, applying the lowest tax rate. The entire income earned during the stay in Poland must be declared.<br><br>In essence, if a Ukrainian citizen has resided in Poland for over 183 days and works remotely for a Ukrainian employer, they are liable for Polish income tax on that income. They must proactively pay advance tax payments and declare all income earned in Poland.<br><br>In summary, Ukrainian citizens residing in Poland for over 183 days and working for Ukrainian employers are subject to Polish income tax on their earnings, according to Polish law and the double taxation treaty with Ukraine. While the ongoing conflict may impede return to Ukraine, a strict interpretation of the 183-day rule means that income earned during this period in Poland is taxable locally. Taxpayers are obligated to make advance tax payments and declare all income received in Poland. Failure to do so may result in adverse consequences.</p>

      <h2>Contributions to the Company Social Benefits Fund in 2022</h2>
      <p class="date">25.01.2022</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full581" style="display:none;">The Act of March 4, 1994, outlines the regulations for the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS) in Poland. Employers operating as budgetary units and local government budgetary establishments must create the fund regardless of the number of employees. Other employers' obligations depend on their employee count as of January 1, 2022. Employers with at least 50 full-time employees must create a ZFŚS, while those with 20 to 49 employees must do so if a trade union requests it. Employers with fewer than 50 employees can opt out of creating the fund and paying holiday benefits.<br><br>Mandatory ZFŚS contributions are specified for employees in normal or special conditions, as well as for juvenile workers. The base for calculating contributions in 2022 is the average monthly wage in the national economy for the second half of 2019, which is 4,434.58 PLN. Contributions range from 1,662.97 PLN for employees in normal conditions to varying amounts for those in arduous conditions or juvenile trainees. Additional contributions are made for disabled employees, retirees under the employer's social care, and employers operating nurseries or children's clubs.<br><br>The allocation of subsidized services and benefits depends on the individual's living, family, and financial situation, as detailed in the employer's regulations. Employers obligated to establish a ZFŚS can lower the fund contribution with union or employee representative agreement. Decisions regarding ZFŚS, including not creating a fund or paying holiday benefits, must be made by the end of January 2022.<br><br>Holiday benefits apply to firms with fewer than 50 employees or those who opted out of ZFŚS, paid once a year to employees taking at least 14 consecutive days of vacation, up to a maximum of 1,662.97 PLN in 2022. These differ from "vacation under the pear tree" benefits (wczasy pod gruszą), which are funded by the ZFŚS and based on financial need. Holiday benefits, in contrast, do not consider financial status but require 14 days of vacation. Holiday benefits are exempt from social security contributions, unlike discretionary vacation bonuses.</p>

      <h2>Financial services - how does the Polish Deal affect their settlement?</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full582" style="display:none;">Effective January 1, 2022, taxpayers can opt out of VAT exemptions for certain financial services in Poland.<br><br>Currently, financial services are generally VAT exempt. The Polish Deal introduces the option for taxpayers to choose taxation for services provided to other taxpayers. This opt-out applies to all financial services provided to taxpayers; selective application is not permitted. Services provided to individuals (B2C) remain mandatorily exempt.<br><br>To opt for taxation, taxpayers must notify the head of the tax office before the start of the tax period and register as an active VAT payer. They can revert to VAT exemption after two years from the initial taxation period by notifying the tax office before the relevant tax period.

      <p class="full-content" id="full583" style="display:none;">The amendment to the Act on Counteracting Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing (AML Act) came into full effect on October 31, 2021. AML, or Anti-Money Laundering, is a core obligation for Polish entrepreneurs, stemming from EU law, and aims to prevent the circulation of illegally sourced assets and the financing of criminal activities. Businesses must possess accurate information about their contractors to avoid potential repercussions for oversight in detecting and reporting financial crimes.<br><br>The AML Act applies to "obliged institutions," including financial and insurance entities, as well as other businesses like accounting service providers, real estate agents, notaries, lawyers (with limitations), offshore and company service providers, and businesses accepting cash payments of €10,000 or more.<br><br>An AML procedure is a set of rules tailored to the nature and size of a business and requires approval from a member of the management board or an employee with relevant expertise. It should cover risk assessment, prevention methods, financial security measures, and internal reporting procedures. Special emphasis should be placed on training employees to properly adhere to the AML procedure. Identifying and verifying the beneficial owner, who controls the transactions, is vital and their identity is disclosed in the Central Register of Beneficial Owners (CRBR). Failure to comply with the AML Act can result in administrative penalties, including publication of violations, orders to cease specific actions, license revocation, bans on holding managerial positions, and fines of up to €1,000,000.</p>

Banks using Polish Accounting Standards create specific reserves for credit exposure risk and related receivables impairments, while those using International Accounting Standards recognize impairment losses.<br><br>Significant differences exist between creating specific reserves under Polish law and impairment losses under International Standards, leading to discrepancies in credit receivable valuation and the reported financial result. The majority of Polish banks report financials using Polish standards.<br><br>Banks classify credit receivables according to the Finance Minister's regulation of December 16, 2008, to determine reserve and impairment levels based on exposure type and risk category.

Reserves are charged to expenses and reversed into income upon resolution. Reserves are created, updated, and reversed quarterly, aligning with exposure reviews. The reserve base is the exposure's book value, adjusted for debt restructuring write-offs.

Employers should already be establishing suitable infrastructure for whistleblowers, even without national regulations. Creating channels for reporting and investigating irregularities is crucial, complementing ethical codes and employee feedback mechanisms. Effective communication is vital for identifying and eliminating issues within the company, possibly through a dedicated internal unit utilizing modern technologies.<br><br>The internal procedure includes: reporting through a designated channel, acknowledgment within 7 days, appointment of an impartial person/department for follow-up, undertaking actions, and providing feedback within 3 months of acknowledgment (or 3 months and 7 days from the original reporting date in the event there is no acknowledgement). Key elements include anonymity, restricted access to confidential data, due diligence, easily accessible information on the procedure, and allowing written, oral, indirect, or direct reporting.<br><br>Organizations with at least 50 employees and all public sector entities must establish internal reporting channels, although the deadline is extended to December 17, 2023, for employers with 50 to 249 employees. Those seeking more information on the technical and legal requirements of reporting procedures can contact experts for support and advice.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full593" style="display:none;">Based on Polish law, specifically the Act of November 20, 1998, and the amendment of October 29, 2021, certain individuals and entities can choose taxation in the form of a lump-sum tax on recorded revenue in 2022. This includes individuals, inherited businesses, civil partnerships, and general partnerships, provided their 2021 revenue did not exceed 9,188,200 PLN (2 million EUR), or for new businesses, regardless of revenue. Certain activities are excluded, such as currency exchange offices, pharmacies, and trade in automotive parts.<br><br>The "Polish Deal" introduces changes to lump-sum tax rates. The 17% and 15% rates are reduced to 14% for healthcare, architectural/engineering, and specialized design services. The 15% rate is lowered to 12% for services related to specific software, software consulting, and IT system management. The definition of "freelance profession" has been narrowed, impacting tax rates for doctors, dentists, vets, technicians, midwives, nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists, architects, engineers, and hourly teachers.<br><br>Significant changes are made to health insurance contributions. The health insurance rate for lump-sum taxpayers is 9% of the assessment base. The monthly assessment base depends on income level and average monthly salary from the fourth quarter of the previous year. Specific rules and examples are provided, including exemptions for individuals with employment income below the minimum wage or self-employment income below 50% of the minimum wage, who have chosen the lump-sum taxation. A new revenue record template will be implemented in 2022. To switch to the lump-sum tax, a statement must be submitted by the 20th of the month following the first revenue or by the end of the year if the first revenue was in December. A detailed analysis of the optimal taxation form is recommended before making a choice.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full596" style="display:none;">The Polish Deal (amendment to income tax laws, effective January 1, 2022) significantly changes the rules for selling post-lease cars purchased for private use. Previously, individuals who bought their leased cars could sell them after six months from the end of the month of purchase without paying income tax.<br><br>Under the new regulations, a tax-free sale is only possible if the car is withdrawn from business activity and six years have passed between the first day of the month following the withdrawal and the date of sale. This means that entrepreneurs buying post-lease cars for private use after January 1, 2022, must wait six years to sell them tax-free. Otherwise, the sale is taxed under general rules, similar to the sale of movable property that were fixed assets.<br><br>However, transitional provisions state that the new rules apply only to assets acquired after December 31, 2021. So, if a car was purchased for private use by December 31, 2021, it can still be sold tax-free after six months. Example: Mr. Michal bought his car on December 30, 2021, and sold it on August 3, 2022, and he is exempt from tax due to the transitional rules. Example: Ms. Anna bought her car on January 3, 2022, and sold it on August 3, 2022, and she is subject to income tax because the 6-year period was not met.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full597" style="display:none;">Banks classify loans according to risk categories defined by the Minister of Finance, ranging from "normal" to "lost," with subdivisions like "under observation," "substandard," and "doubtful." The assessment of a debtor's economic and financial situation is a significant challenge, as the regulations provide only general guidelines, including quantitative (financial ratios) and qualitative (management assessment, market dependence) measures, as well as external credit ratings.<br><br>"Normal" indicates a sound financial situation, while "under observation" denotes heightened scrutiny due to regional, industry, or product risks, exemplified by the HORECA sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. "Substandard" signifies a potential threat to timely repayment, often due to losses or unmet projections. "Doubtful" implies substantial financial deterioration impacting capital, such as negative equity, though specific thresholds aren't defined. "Lost" signifies irreversible inability to repay, bankruptcy, liquidation, or legal disputes. Reclassification to a lower risk category is possible after the debtor regains full creditworthiness and maintains timely payments for at least three months. Banks must verify the full creditworthiness recovery before downgrading by a maximum of one category at a time. The absence of detailed regulations necessitates a high degree of individual assessment by banks.</p>

      <h2>Mergers – Acquisition Method [Part 2]</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full599" style="display:none;">Company mergers are a broad topic, but often crucial for many businesses. This article, split into two parts, focuses on choosing the correct merger method and highlights key related issues. This section discusses mergers using the acquisition method, and the prior article covers mergers via the pooling of interests method.<br><br>According to accounting law, commercial companies can merge using either the acquisition method, where the acquired company's assets transfer to the acquiring or newly formed company, or the pooling of interests method, used when existing shareholders retain control post-merger. The nature of the merger dictates the method for financial reporting.<br><br>The acquisition method involves summing the acquiring company's assets and liabilities at their book value with the acquired company's assets and liabilities at their fair value on the merger date. The acquired company's equity at the merger date, calculated as net assets at fair value, is excluded. Mutual debts, obligations, and other settlements between the merging companies are also excluded.<br><br>Fair value is specifically defined in accounting law for balance sheet components, such as quoted securities being their current price less sale costs, receivables being their discounted present value, and inventories being net sale price less profit margin.<br><br>The acquisition price is defined by law. Examples include the purchase price of treasury shares when acquired for the purpose of the merger, the price of shares in the acquired company, or the fair value of the payment when other than cash or shares.<br><br>If the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the acquired company's net assets, goodwill arises, recognized as an asset and amortized over its economic life (up to 5 years if economic life is indeterminable), with amortization expenses shown as other operating costs. If the acquisition price is lower than the fair value, negative goodwill arises and is recognized as deferred income over the weighted average economic life of the depreciable assets acquired, or, above a certain value, it is recognized immediately as other operating income.<br><br>Direct merger-related costs increase the acquisition price, while costs of establishing a new joint-stock company or increasing share capital reduce the acquiring company's retained earnings (up to the excess of issue value over nominal share value), with the remainder treated as financial expenses.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full601" style="display:none;">An industrial consumer is a business operating in specific industrial sectors, such as mining, plastics processing, wood or cork production (excluding furniture), paper manufacturing, and metal processing. A defining characteristic is a high electricity intensity ratio, meaning energy costs constitute a significant portion of overall expenses. To determine if a business qualifies as an industrial consumer, it must identify if its activities fall under the specified industries and assess its annual electricity consumption.<br><br>Industrial consumers can benefit from implementing renewable energy sources (RES) by reducing electricity-related fees, particularly those associated with RES. Savings apply to both energy purchase and distribution costs. The extent of financial benefits from RES discounts depends on the electricity intensity ratio. Higher energy consumption translates to a larger share of RES-related fees and, consequently, a greater financial relief. Discounts are tiered based on the electricity intensity ratio: 20% (3-20% ratio), 40% (20-40% ratio), and 85% (above 40% ratio). For example, a company using 5 GWh of RES energy annually can save tens of thousands of Polish zlotys per year through the RES discount.</p>

Key changes include expanded producer responsibility, obligating those introducing products to the market to ensure proper waste collection, possess the necessary financial and organizational resources, implement self-monitoring mechanisms, and publicly disclose information on waste management goals.<br><br>A draft law, already in parliament, mandates producers to not limit their waste collection efforts to only profitable cases and to ensure adequate system availability. Effective January 1, 2022, entities introducing packaged goods must ensure packaging waste recycling and achieve specified recycling levels by 2030.<br><br>Another draft bill introduces changes to product fees, requiring retailers, wholesalers, and food service businesses to charge customers for single-use plastic packaging and offer alternatives. This bill also prohibits the introduction of certain single-use plastic products, like cutlery and straws.<br><br>Furthermore, a packaging fee will be levied on those introducing products in household packaging, with a maximum rate of PLN 2 per kilogram, varying based on packaging type and recyclability.

      <p class="full-content" id="full613" style="display:none;">In the EU, individuals are generally subject to the social security laws of only one member state. If a foreign company employs someone in Poland, that employee typically falls under the Polish social security system (ZUS). The foreign company, as the employer, must register with ZUS. This requires obtaining a NIP (tax identification number) from the Second Tax Office in Warsaw-Śródmieście, submitting necessary documents including a NIP-2 form, a cover letter, and a certified translation of the company's registration extract. After obtaining the NIP, the employer is registered with ZUS using forms ZUS ZPA and a copy of the NIP decision. Employees are then registered using form ZUS ZUA. Monthly declarations and contributions are due by the 15th of the following month.<br><br>Alternatively, ZUS allows the employee to assume the employer's obligations. This requires a written agreement, and the employee registers with ZUS using forms ZUS ZUA/ZZA, ZUS ZAA, and copies of the agreement and their own NIP decision, taking responsibility for payments and declarations. These regulations also apply to Switzerland and the EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway). For companies outside the EU, Switzerland, and the EEA, social security obligations depend on existing agreements between Poland and the company's country of origin.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full615" style="display:none;">Mergers of companies, a broad and crucial topic for many businesses, can be executed using one of two methods under Polish accounting law: the acquisition method or the pooling of interests method. The acquisition method applies when the acquired company's assets transfer to the acquiring or newly formed company. The pooling of interests method is used when the original shareholders retain control after the merger.<br><br>The pooling of interests method, often used for merging subsidiaries under common control or lower-level parent entities with subsidiaries, involves summing the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of the combined entities as of the merger date, followed by specific exclusions. This summation requires verifying that financial statement items are presented using uniform valuation principles. Exclusions include the capital of the transferred company, mutual debts, receivables, similar settlements, reciprocal income and expenses, and mutual profits and losses from pre-merger transactions. The materiality principle guides the elimination of mutual transactions, allowing for non-exclusion if it doesn't compromise the financial statement's reliability.<br><br>Costs associated with the merger, such as advisory and legal fees, along with new company formation and capital increase costs, are treated as period costs and reported as financial expenses. To ensure data comparability when a merger occurs mid-year, the company should present comparative data for the previous fiscal year as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of that year.</p>

      <h2>Is remote work reimbursement possible?</h2>
      <p class="date">22.09.2021</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full616" style="display:none;">The Polish "Tarcza 4.0" law of June 19, 2020, addresses remote work regulations but lacks clarity, particularly regarding accidents during remote work and cost allocation for employees working outside the office. The law doesn't mandate employers to reimburse remote work expenses, although they must provide adequate tools, materials, and logistical support. Reimbursement for electricity or internet costs is not obligatory. Employers cover installation, service, and maintenance of equipment, but increased internet usage or higher bills due to remote work are discretionary expenses for the employer. This stems from the distinction between remote work and telework, where, under the Labor Code, employers *are* required to cover such costs for teleworkers. Reimbursements for necessary work-related equipment do not generate taxable income for the employee. Forthcoming changes aim to establish cost reimbursement rules within internal company regulations.<br><br>Communication with employers is crucial to avoid misunderstandings, as Polish law permits, but doesn't mandate, employers to provide appropriate compensation without tax implications. Remote work offers advantages such as saving time and money on commuting, promoting environmental awareness, and providing flexibility for better work-life balance. While remote work is beneficial, consulting with professionals for further informations is a good way to get a deeper understanding.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full617" style="display:none;">The "Cashless Taxpayer" program, created by the Ministry of Finance, targets entrepreneurs who primarily conduct payment transactions cashless. It offers two options, SILVER and GOLD, available from early 2022.<br><br>The SILVER package provides a tax relief for taxpayers who haven't used payment terminals in the past year or who continue cashless payments after participating in the "Polish Cashless" program. This allows a deduction of 100% of the cost of acquiring a payment terminal from income, while also including 100% of these costs as revenue-generating expenses. The maximum deduction is typically PLN 1,000 annually, but PLN 2,500 for taxpayers exempt from using cash registers. This relief lasts for two years from the start of incurring transaction processing costs.<br><br>The GOLD package, for taxpayers who operate cashless for at least seven months a year, offers an indefinite terminal relief. This includes an additional 200% deduction of expenses, with a limit of PLN 2,000 per year. Furthermore, these taxpayers will benefit from an accelerated VAT refund, up to a maximum of 15 days.</p>

This applies to tax capital groups, regardless of revenue, and other taxpayers if their annual revenue exceeds the equivalent of 50 million euros.<br><br>Taxpayers are obligated to publish information about their tax strategy for 2020, requiring a review and potential restructuring of internal tax procedures.

      <p class="full-content" id="full619" style="display:none;">According to the Polish Labor Code, employees are entitled to 20 or 26 days of vacation leave per year, which employers must grant within that calendar year. Unused vacation days become overdue on January 1st of the following year and must be taken by the end of September. Claims for vacation leave expire after 3 years.<br><br>Employers face fines ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 PLN for failing to grant overdue leave within the specified timeframe, as it's considered a violation of employee rights.<br><br>During the COVID-19 pandemic, special regulations were introduced allowing employers to grant up to 30 days of overdue leave without employee consent, bypassing vacation plans. However, this doesn't override the obligation to grant overdue leave by the end of September.<br><br>If an employee is quarantined or isolated, standard leave regulations apply. Quarantine during planned leave results in its cancellation, while during ongoing leave, it is interrupted. Employees may be able to work remotely during quarantine with employer consent, utilizing their leave.<br><br>If an employee cannot use overdue leave by September 30th due to quarantine, the employer will not be penalized, but should schedule its use as soon as possible after the employee returns to work. Importantly, "on-demand" vacation days from the previous year are not considered overdue and require employer agreement for scheduling.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full620" style="display:none;">**VAT Group**<br><br>The VAT group, proposed under the Polish Deal program, operates in 18 EU countries and is enabled by the VAT Directive (2006/112/WE). It aims to allow financially, economically, and organizationally linked entities to settle VAT jointly, functioning as a single VAT taxpayer. Internal transactions within the VAT group are not subject to VAT, ensuring tax neutrality. Transactions with entities outside the group are treated as if they are with the entire group. The split payment mechanism is excluded for intra-group turnovers. Entities based in Poland or conducting business in Poland through a branch can form a VAT group by entering into a written agreement.<br><br>**Accelerated VAT Refund**<br><br>To promote cashless transactions, taxpayers can receive a VAT refund within 15 days if they meet specific criteria, including a high proportion of payments made using payment instruments. Failure to accept cashless payments may result in temporary exclusion from certain tax preferences, such as quarterly settlements and the right to a 25-day VAT refund.<br><br>**Taxation of Financial Services**<br><br>Financial services are generally VAT-exempt, but the VAT Directive allows for optional taxation. The proposed regulations offer taxpayers the choice to tax financial services provided exclusively to other VAT taxpayers. Services to non-VAT taxpayers remain VAT-exempt. This aims to increase VAT neutrality in the financial sector by granting the right to deduct input tax on purchases related to providing these services. Taxpayers opting out of the exemption must tax all financial services provided to taxpayers for a minimum of two years. They must also notify the tax office and register as an active VAT payer to apply this taxation option.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full621" style="display:none;">On August 4, 2021, a new draft law amending the VAT Act and some other acts (UD159) was published, implementing the National e-Invoice System (KSeF) and enabling the issuance and receipt of structured invoices through it. Initially planned for October 1, 2021, the effective date is now proposed for January 1, 2022.<br><br>KSeF is designed as an IT system for receiving and storing structured invoices. It will assign a unique identification number to each invoice and verify its compliance with the structured invoice template. An invoice is considered issued and delivered on the day the system assigns it an ID number. While the use of KSeF will be voluntary initially, mandatory electronic invoicing is planned for all entities from 2023.<br><br>To facilitate timely adaptation, the Ministry of Finance has published a working version of the e-Invoice logical structure and sample files. The logical structure will eventually be published on the e-PUAP platform.<br><br>Incentives for using KSeF include faster VAT refunds (40 days instead of 60), subject to conditions like issuing only structured invoices during the entire settlement period and being an active VAT payer for over 12 months, and not exceeding 3000 PLN. Receiving structured invoices via KSeF requires recipient consent; otherwise, the issuer must provide it in another agreed-upon manner. Corrections to structured invoices can only be made through KSeF. Currently, VAT RR and pro forma invoices cannot be issued in KSeF. Taxpayers who opt for KSeF are exempt from the 10-year invoice storage and archiving obligation.</p>

It is being prepared by the Ministry of Health. Its goal is to support actions that ensure protection in workplaces where coronavirus infections occur.<br><br>Thus, the proposed regulation would introduce solutions allowing employers to obtain certain information about the health status of employees. This information would relate to vaccination, having had an infection, and having a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result.<br><br>The employer will be able to take new steps towards unvaccinated employees, those who have not recovered from the infection, or those who do not have a valid negative test result.<br><br>What if data is missing?<br><br>If the project comes into force - and this may happen as early as September 2021 - the employer will gain new opportunities to react to unvaccinated employees, those who have not recovered, or those who do not have a negative test result.<br><br>On the one hand, such an employee can be sent on unpaid leave, which means a lack of income and insurance. Importantly, the employer will not have the right to dismiss an unvaccinated employee or one who has not recovered.<br><br>On the other hand, the employer will have the right to delegate an employee to work remotely or to other tasks. However, it is important that while performing other tasks, the employee will receive remuneration corresponding to the new duties, which may be lower.<br><br>The employer will also be able to require the submission of data on vaccination, having had the disease, or a negative COVID-19 test result before a new employee starts work.<br><br>The Great Unknowns of the Draft Law<br><br>The fundamental problem with this bill is that it is not yet known whether these will be the obligations or the rights of the company. It is also not known how long the employer will be able to send an employee on unpaid leave. It is also not known whether it will be possible to hire a replacement for an employee on unpaid leave at the employer's request. Worse, while on unpaid leave, an employee who is ready to work is deprived of pay and insurance.<br><br>Furthermore, it is not known how to approach an employee who cannot receive a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for medical reasons. Another unknown is how the employer should interpret an employee's refusal to provide information about their health - in this case, for example, vaccination.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>A proposed amendment to Poland's COVID-19 law aims to bolster workplace safety by granting employers access to employees' vaccination, infection history, and test results. This would allow employers to manage unvaccinated, non-recovered, or untested individuals. Employers could mandate unpaid leave, preventing termination, or reassign employees to remote or alternative tasks, potentially affecting pay. New hires could also be required to provide health information. Key uncertainties remain: whether these provisions are employer obligations or rights, the duration of unpaid leave, and the possibility of hiring replacements. The lack of clarity also extends to employees with medical vaccine exemptions and those who refuse to disclose health data. The potential loss of income and insurance during unpaid leave raises concerns.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full623" style="display:none;">Valuing a business goes beyond just numbers; it's about understanding the story behind them. Professor Aswath Damodaran emphasizes that business valuation is "history plus numbers." The author's experience confirms that similar-looking financial figures can lead to different valuations depending on the company's narrative. Three key questions should be addressed for a reliable valuation: who is the intended recipient, which valuation method is most appropriate, and what other factors accompany the transaction. Always review the valuation result with common sense and consider multiples.<br><br>The person paying isn't always the one who dictates the valuation. Consider the perspective of the counterparty, whether it's a minority shareholder or an external investor. Focus on what the business is worth today, not what an investor might transform it into. Be aware of what holds value for you might not for an investor.<br><br>There are three core approaches: asset-based, income-based, and market-based valuation. Asset-based valuation measures the historical effect on assets, often readily available in a company's balance sheet, especially the equity, which can be used as a benchmark. Income-based valuation assesses future free cash flows, though susceptible to manipulation. Market-based valuation uses comparable transactions but is most reliable in an active market. Each method has its place depending on the company's circumstances and available information.<br><br>Beyond numbers, understanding the source of success and potential weaknesses is crucial. The role of the owner and realistic growth opportunities can dramatically alter a valuation. Multiples, such as revenue or EBITDA, serve as a sanity check. The real valuation is based on a true understanding of the business and its advantages. Be open-minded and consult with experts who can offer a comprehensive perspective.</p>

This package follows the initial SLIM VAT introduced in late 2020.<br><br>Key changes include VAT deduction rules for intra-community acquisitions and service imports. The new rules allow for deducting input VAT in the same period the tax obligation arose, provided the taxpayer reports the output VAT in the corresponding tax return. This change reflects a recent EU Court of Justice ruling.<br><br>Regarding the split payment mechanism, taxpayers can now transfer funds between VAT accounts in different banks. However, releasing funds from the VAT account to a regular account still requires approval from tax authorities. The tax office can approve such release even with tax arrears if the taxpayer has a deferred payment or installment agreement.<br><br>SLIM VAT 2 also simplifies VAT corrections, enabling taxpayers to deduct VAT "on an ongoing basis" after the deadline by expanding the number of reporting periods in which a correction can be made. Other changes include extending the bad debt relief period from two to three years, clarifying which supply in chain transactions is attributed to shipment/transport based on which entity is responsible, and allowing suppliers and buyers to jointly declare their choice of real estate taxation in the notarial deed.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full626" style="display:none;">Currently, remote work is regulated only by general anti-crisis shield regulations, lacking specific provisions for workplace accidents during remote work. Despite planned amendments to the labor code, concrete regulations on this issue are still absent.<br><br>According to the law, a workplace accident is defined as a sudden event caused by an external factor, resulting in injury or death, occurring during work-related activities or at the employer's disposal. Examples during remote work include electric shock from equipment or falls due to cables.<br><br>Remote work assignment is ordered by the employer and is currently temporary, based on COVID-19 regulations. These regulations allow employers to order remote work during epidemic states and three months after their cancellation, provided the employee has the necessary skills, technical capabilities, and the work type allows it. Employers must provide necessary tools and logistics, and employees may use their own equipment if confidentiality and data protection are maintained. Employees must record their work activities as directed. The employer can revoke the remote work order at any time. Key principles include no need to amend employment contracts, temporary assignment, and informing employees about work procedures.<br><br>The biggest challenge is potential workplace accidents during remote work, often underestimated by employers. The lack of clear regulations complicates safety compliance. Employers are responsible for workplace accidents under the labor code and occupational health and safety (BHP) rules. The Chief Labor Inspectorate (GIP) may choose not to investigate remote work accidents but doesn't absolve employers from determining accident causes and preparing post-accident reports.<br><br>Employees are always entitled to ZUS accident insurance benefits. Employers may face civil liability, especially when they lack control over remote work conditions. Implementing internal regulations like remote work instructions, outlining basic duties and risk analysis, is the safest approach for employers.</p>

The deadline for submitting transfer pricing information (TPR) is extended to the end of the 11th month after the tax year's end.<br><br>Analyses: Exemptions from comparability/conformity analyses are available for controlled transactions involving micro/small enterprises, non-controlled transactions with tax havens, and transactions meeting safe harbor criteria for low-value services.<br><br>Penal Fiscal Code Sanctions: Failure to prepare or inaccurate preparation of transfer pricing documentation or information carries a fine of up to 720 daily rates (up to PLN 26.9 million). Late submission results in a fine of up to 240 daily rates (up to PLN 8.9 million).<br><br>Other Changes: VAT must be included in the value of a controlled transaction if the taxpayer has limited or no right to deduct it. The separate statement regarding the preparation of transfer pricing documentation and the market conformity of transfer prices is eliminated; this statement is incorporated into the TPR form. The TPR form must be signed by the head of the unit (as defined by accounting law) and by an authorized representative (procurator or professional attorney). The obligation to prepare and submit the ORD-U form is waived for taxpayers required to submit transfer pricing information (except for taxpayers conducting transactions with tax havens). Documentation obligations are now linked to the taxpayer's tax year instead of the accounting year.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full628" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>Therefore, from January 1, 2022, the only form of taxation for income (revenue) derived from so-called private rentals will be a flat-rate tax on recorded revenue. This, in turn, may cause private rentals to become less profitable after the introduction of tax changes.<br><br>CURRENT RULES<br><br>Currently, according to the PIT Act, the taxpayer has the right to choose the taxation of income from so-called private rental. The first option is taxation according to general rules (tax scale). In this situation, the taxpayer determines the revenue they earn and deducts from it the costs associated with the property (e.g., property insurance, renovation, furnishings, loan interest, and property tax). From the income thus obtained, they pay PIT tax according to the scale, i.e., 17% or 32%. The second method is taxation based on a flat-rate tax on recorded revenue. According to the rates in force in 2021, the flat-rate tax on recorded revenue is 8.5% of revenue up to PLN 100,000 per year and 12.5% of revenue exceeding this amount.<br><br>In the case of renting residential premises conducted as part of business activity, it is also possible to use a flat rate or taxation according to the scale or taxation at a flat rate of 19%.<br><br>Taxpayers incurring significant costs related to the rented property may not show taxable income or show income in a small amount under the current legal status.<br><br>PLANNED NEW RULES - POLISH DEAL<br><br>The draft regulations assume that from January 1, 2022, the only form of taxation of taxpayers' income from so-called private rental will be a flat-rate tax on recorded revenue. As a result, the possibility of choosing between taxation of rental income with a recorded flat rate and general rules will disappear. In addition, taxpayers will lose the ability to reduce the tax base by the costs associated with obtaining this income, because the taxation will be based not on income, but on the landlord's revenue from the lease. Furthermore, it should be noted that with flat-rate taxation, it is not possible to take advantage of the tax-free amount, which from January 1, 2022, is to be PLN 30,000.<br><br>At the same time, the project excludes depreciation deductions for residential buildings and premises rented as part of so-called private rental and as part of business activity from tax-deductible expenses.<br><br>Information on other tax changes under the Polish Deal project can be found HERE.<br><br>If you are interested in details regarding the above changes, please contact us.<br><br>rental, taxes, Polish Deal<br><br>Feel free to contact us<br><br>agnieszka.drozdz-wilk@moorepolska.pl<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>From January 1, 2022, the "Polish Deal" legislation will mandate a flat-rate tax on recorded revenue as the sole method for taxing income from private rentals in Poland. This eliminates the option of using general taxation rules, potentially reducing profitability for landlords. Currently, landlords can choose between general rules (17% or 32% tax on income after deducting costs) or a flat-rate tax (8.5% on revenue up to PLN 100,000, and 12.5% above). The change means landlords can no longer deduct property-related expenses like insurance or mortgage interest, and cannot avail of the tax-free allowance of 30,000 PLN. The new rules also prevent depreciation deductions for rental properties, impacting both private and business rentals. This shift is significant because it taxes gross revenue rather than net income, potentially increasing the tax burden for landlords who previously benefited from deductible expenses.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full630" style="display:none;">When hiring part-time employees, calculating their annual leave entitlement can be challenging. According to the Polish Labour Code (Art. 154§2), leave is granted on working days according to the employee's schedule, measured in hours corresponding to their daily working time. One day of leave is equivalent to 8 hours of work.<br><br>For part-time employees, the leave entitlement is calculated proportionally to their working hours. Any fractional part of a day is rounded up to a full day. It's important to note that each leave day deducts the actual number of hours the employee would have worked. Employee tenure also plays a significant role, influencing the overall leave allowance.<br><br>The article provides specific examples for various part-time fractions (1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 7/8 of full-time) and distinguishes between employees with less than 10 years of service and those with over 20 years. For instance, a 1/4 time employee with less than 10 years of service is entitled to 40 hours of leave annually (5 days of 8 hours), while a 1/4 time employee with over 20 years gets 56 hours (7 days of 8 hours), assuming a 5-day work week with 2-hour shifts. Similar calculations are presented for other part-time ratios, highlighting how increased seniority translates to more total leave hours. For specific queries, individuals are encouraged to contact the provided expert.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full632" style="display:none;">The Polish National Court Register (KRS) is undergoing digitalization. As of July 1, 2021, paper applications to the KRS will no longer be accepted for entities in the business register. All changes must be submitted via the Portal Rejestrów Sądowych (Court Registers Portal) at https://prs.ms.gov.pl. Paper applications will be returned without a chance to correct errors. This doesn't apply to associations, which can still file paper applications, but online options are also available.<br><br>Using the portal for KRS applications requires user registration and authentication via a qualified electronic signature or Trusted Profile (Profil Zaufany). A representative or attorney must create the account. Applications will use interactive online forms to collect the same information as before. Payment, typically 350 zł, will be enforced online before submission, similar to the S24 portal. The digitalization includes receiving court notifications electronically, with rulings accessible by logging into the portal. The portal also enables searching KRS entities, reporting and viewing financial documents, and accessing the S24 portal. Notarized documents require specifying the registration number in the Central Repository of Electronic Notarial Act Extracts, replacing scanned copies. These changes aim to accelerate registration procedures, reduce paperwork, shorten processing times, minimize errors, and allow electronic access to registration files for cases initiated after July 1st.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full633" style="display:none;">An amendment to the regulation on issuing invoices, effective from July 1st, 2021, has changed how certain tickets are treated for VAT purposes. Previously, tickets from carriers like PKP, PKS, and LOT could be considered VAT invoices if they included specific information: the issuing date and number, the carrier's name and tax identification number (NIP), details about the service provided, the tax amount, and the total amount due. Additionally, the journey had to cover a minimum distance of 50 kilometers.<br><br>The key change introduced by the new regulation is the removal of this 50 km distance limitation. Consequently, as of July 1st, any single-use travel ticket, regardless of the distance traveled, is now considered a VAT invoice, provided it still meets all the previously stated information requirements. This change simplifies the process for passengers who can now use these tickets as VAT invoices. While urban transport tickets could also qualify, they often lack the necessary data specified in the regulation.<br><br>This updated regulation impacts how tickets are recognized for accounting and tax purposes.</p>

      <h2>Hypothetical Capital Interest Benefit for CIT Taxpayers</h2>
      <p class="date">07.07.2021</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full634" style="display:none;">The amended Corporate Income Tax Act, specifically Article 15cb, allows for the inclusion of hypothetical interest on capital contributions and profits allocated to reserves as tax-deductible costs. This provision incentivizes companies to retain profits rather than relying solely on external financing, as interest on external debt typically reduces taxable income but represents an actual company expense.<br><br>Tax-deductible costs for capital acquisition are recognized when a resolution to transfer profit to reserves is passed, or for shareholder contributions, upon the funds' arrival in the company's bank account. These hypothetical interest amounts can be recognized as tax costs in the year of the resolution, the receipt of contributions, and the two subsequent tax years.<br><br>The regulation has conditions. A primary limit is PLN 250,000 for tax-deductible costs per taxpayer annually. Interest cannot be calculated on contributions intended to cover balance sheet losses. If shareholders receive a distribution of retained profits or have their capital contributions returned within three years from the end of the tax year in which the profit was retained or contributions were received, the tax benefit is lost, requiring correction of tax costs.<br><br>The deductible amount is calculated by multiplying the NBP reference rate from the last business day of the preceding year, increased by 1 percentage point, by the sum of capital contributions and profits allocated to reserves. The maximum hypothetical interest allowed as a tax-deductible cost offers a tax benefit of PLN 47,500 annually.<br><br>An anti-avoidance clause, effective from January 1, 2021, disallows the application of Article 15cb if the decision to retain profits or make capital contributions is primarily for tax benefits without sound economic reasons beyond taxation. This applies particularly to entities that historically paid dividends instead of retaining profits.<br><br>---<br><br>The amended Corporate Income Tax Act allows companies to deduct hypothetical interest on capital contributions and retained profits, simulating the cost of external financing. This encourages profit retention. Tax benefits are recognized upon resolutions for profit allocation or receipt of contributions and can be claimed for up to three years. Key conditions include an annual deduction limit of PLN 250,000 and a prohibition on using contributions for losses. Tax benefits are forfeited if retained profits are distributed or contributions are returned within three years. The deductible amount is based on a reference rate plus one percent, applied to contributions and retained profits. An anti-avoidance clause prevents the use of this provision if the primary motive is tax advantage without economic justification.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full635" style="display:none;">Effective July 1, 2021, amendments to regulations concerning the detailed scope of data in VAT declarations and records come into force, impacting JPK VAT filings submitted for July (due August 25th). These changes are partially related to the e-commerce law also effective July 1st.<br><br>The new JPK_V7 introduces symbols like "WSTO_EE" for intra-community distance sales and telecom/broadcasting/electronic services to non-taxable entities, replacing "SW" and "EE." Intermediary platforms not registered in IOSS or OSS but responsible for VAT on non-EU shipments will use "IED."<br><br>Other key changes include: removing the mandatory "MPP" designation on both sales and purchases (though required on sales invoices); allowing aggregated reporting of simplified invoices (receipts with NIP under PLN 450 or EUR 100) and highway toll/single-ticket transport invoices, with separate JPK_FA reporting unchanged; mandating the reporting of payment/receipt dates for "bad debt relief" corrections. The regulation clarifies GTU code applications, referencing CN 2020 or PKWiU 2015 classifications, including GTU_12 for audit services (PKWiU 69.20.1). GTU codes are renumbered "GTU_01" to "GTU_13," are not used for "WEW" and "RO" transactions, and internal correction notes for input tax (art. 86 section 19a) can be reported via the "WEW" document in the absence of a correcting invoice. Procedures codes are waived for internal sales records "RO", and the "TP" designation is removed when connections between parties result only from ties to the State Treasury or local government.<br><br>Removing "MPP" is a positive simplification, but new obligations like reporting payment terms for bad debt relief are introduced.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full637" style="display:none;">Parental leave in 2022 will see significant changes, particularly for fathers, as EU member states must adapt their laws to the EU Work-Life Balance Directive by August 2, 2022. Directive (EU) 2019/1158 introduces substantial modifications to parental rights, impacting parental leave and flexible work arrangements.<br><br>Key changes focus on fathers' parental leave entitlements. Firstly, fathers will gain an individual right to four months of parental leave, usable before the child turns eight, independent of the mother's entitlement. Currently, if a mother isn't eligible for parental leave, she cannot transfer this right to the father. Secondly, fathers will be allocated a non-transferable minimum of two months of parental leave. If not used, these two months will be forfeited.<br><br>These reforms aim to encourage fathers to utilize their parental leave, facilitate mothers' return to the workforce, and promote a more equal parenting model by increasing fathers' involvement in childcare. Ultimately, the directive seeks to create a more level playing field for both sexes in the labor market and reduce the gender pay gap.<br><br>Parental leave in 2022 brings important changes, especially for fathers, due to the EU Work-Life Balance Directive. By August 2, 2022, EU countries must align their laws with Directive (EU) 2019/1158. This directive significantly alters parental rights, including parental leave, with a focus on fathers.<br><br>The core changes grant fathers an individual entitlement to four months of parental leave, transferable before the child's eighth birthday, and this right is independent of the mother's eligibility. Furthermore, fathers will have a non-transferable minimum of two months of parental leave, which they must use or lose.<br><br>These measures are designed to encourage fathers' participation in parental leave, support mothers' re-entry into the workforce, and foster a more equitable family dynamic by increasing fathers' role in childcare. The overarching goal is to promote gender equality in the workplace and narrow the gender pay gap.</p>

They must then be submitted within 15 days of approval. In Poland, financial statements are exclusively accepted in electronic format and must be filed with the National Court Register (KRS).<br><br>The filing requirement includes the annual financial statement, the auditor's report (if applicable), a resolution on approval and profit/loss distribution, and the management board's activity report (if mandated). Failure to comply can result in fines or imprisonment for the company's management. The KRS can initiate enforcement proceedings, demanding submission within seven days under penalty of a fine. Persistent non-compliance by partnerships may lead to dissolution or liquidation.<br><br>The company's management is responsible for electronically filing the financial statement with the KRS. Submitting late is a criminal offense, prosecuted against the manager, not the company. Properly filed statements require electronic signatures from the person managing the accounting records and the current management body members. Statements must be signed by the management composition in office at the time of submission, not those who served during the accounting year.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full639" style="display:none;">The text discusses the importance of setting clear boundaries between a family business and family life, drawing a parallel to the saying, "Good fences make good neighbors." It argues that while an invisible, non-restrictive boundary might seem preferable, a well-defined, even "obstructed" one is crucial for the health of both the business and the family.<br><br>Failing to separate business time from family time, even with small, seemingly innocent concessions, can lead to the gradual erosion of personal boundaries. This can result in the business encroaching on family life, causing detriment to one or the other. The author suggests starting by maintaining a business-free atmosphere during important family occasions and gradually extending this to everyday conversations.<br><br>Drawing on the insights of David Bork, the text emphasizes defining clear roles, responsibilities, ownership, and private matters within a family business to prevent conflicts, much like precisely defined national borders prevent disputes. When a business consumes excessive family time due to disorganization, constant firefighting, or regulatory ignorance, it's a sign that boundaries are being crossed. The solution lies in organizing the business's core elements to reclaim time for family. The latter part of the text offers business consulting services to achieve this by assessing the company, auditing processes, managing costs and taxes, handling HR and legal matters, and developing client acquisition strategies.<br><br>The importance of clearly defined boundaries between a family business and personal life cannot be overstated. Just as good fences maintain good neighborly relations, clear divisions between work and family prevent conflicts and ensure the well-being of both spheres. While a subtle, unobtrusive boundary might seem ideal, a well-established, even guarded one is essential. Neglecting to set and maintain these boundaries, even through minor compromises, can lead to the business gradually encroaching on family time, ultimately jeopardizing one or both. Establishing a business-free environment during significant family events and extending this practice to everyday conversations is a practical approach. Defining roles, responsibilities, and private matters within a family business is crucial for preventing disputes, mirroring how clear national borders avert conflicts. When a business's disorganization leads to excessive demands on family time, it signifies a boundary breach. Organizing the business's core functions is key to reclaiming personal time for family.

      <p class="full-content" id="full640" style="display:none;">The VAT e-commerce package introduces EU-wide directives to combat VAT fraud in cross-border B2C e-commerce. Previously, sales below individual national thresholds (35,000-100,000 euros) could be taxed in the country of dispatch. The new package standardizes this threshold to 10,000 euros net across all EU member states. Sales exceeding this limit, based on the current and previous tax year's value, will now be taxed in the destination country. This lower threshold means more businesses will need to register for VAT in countries where they supply goods.<br><br>To simplify this, the VAT-OSS (One Stop Shop) procedure allows businesses to declare and pay VAT for all EU B2C transactions through a single VAT return in their home country, applying the destination country's VAT rates. Additionally, the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) simplifies VAT for imported goods valued up to 150 euros from outside the EU. Under IOSS, VAT is collected at the point of sale and declared in the member state of identification.<br><br>Furthermore, online platforms facilitating the sale of low-value imported goods (under 150 euros) or intra-EU distance sales are now considered to have received and supplied these goods themselves, making them responsible for collecting and remitting VAT. This also applies to platforms enabling distance sales within the EU by businesses not established in the EU.<br><br>Keywords: b2c, e-commerce, cross-border electronic commerce, VAT e-commerce package, platform, marketplace, portal, threshold, VAT, VAT-OSS, distance selling.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full647" style="display:none;">The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) released an updated Report to the Nations on employee fraud in April 2020. The study of 2,504 fraud cases revealed an average loss of $1.6 million per company.<br><br>Employee fraud involves misusing a company position for personal gain and falls into three main categories: asset misappropriation, corruption, and financial statement fraud. Factors like tenure, gender, education, and age influence the amount of damage caused. Men commit the majority of frauds (72%), and better-educated employees with longer tenures tend to cause greater losses.<br><br>The Fraud Triangle theory explains why employees commit fraud, highlighting the importance of addressing risks to prevent it. Weak internal controls, ignored regulations, ineffective oversight, and a tolerant organizational culture contribute to fraud.<br><br>The most common methods for detecting fraud, according to the ACFE report, are tips from whistleblowers (43%), internal audits (15%), management reviews (12%), other sources (6%), and by chance (5%). Implementing a whistleblower program is crucial for effectively detecting and preventing employee fraud. Approximately half of whistleblowers are employees, while the other half are third parties, including clients, vendors, competitors, and anonymous sources. Thoroughly evaluating whistleblower information should be a priority in fraud prevention.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full648" style="display:none;">Employee claims are rights to demand specific actions from an employer, such as wage payments or vacation time. The statute of limitations for these claims is strictly defined by the Labor Code and cannot be altered. This 3-year limitation applies to both financial claims (like unpaid wages or bonuses) and non-financial claims (like unused vacation).<br><br>The limitation period starts when the claim becomes due, generally the day the obligation should have been fulfilled. For wages, this is the day following the payment deadline set in the employment contract or company regulations, with the ultimate deadline being the 10th of the following month. Claims for bonuses or jubilee awards expire three years after the payment date or eligibility date. Overtime pay claims expire three years from the date of payment for the month in which daily overtime occurred, or from the end of the settlement period for average weekly overtime.<br><br>Retirement or disability severance pay claims expire three years after termination if the employee met the eligibility criteria. Vacation claims expire three years after the end of the calendar year the vacation was earned, or the end of the third quarter of the following year for overdue vacation. Severance pay in lieu of unused vacation expires three years from termination. Claims to establish an employment relationship have no statute of limitations, though associated wage claims are subject to the 3-year limit. Claims confirmed by a court ruling or settlement expire after 10 years.</p>

However, it's important to consider the broader perspective and global trends.<br><br>BENEFITS OF IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM FOR REPORTING IRREGULARITIES<br><br>Organizations that have implemented channels for reporting irregularities demonstrate transparent business practices, respecting legal regulations and ethical principles. These entities foster greater trust among contractors, leading to stronger development, while employees appreciate fair play.<br><br>Companies seeking to avoid liability due to irregularities with their business partners choose entities with impeccable reputations, prioritizing both their image and the security of economic transactions, aligning with compliance principles.<br><br>A whistleblower protection system is part of a broader compliance system within an organization, and the Directive regulates the protection of individuals (whistleblowers) who report irregularities and violations they learn about in a work-related context.<br><br>IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM FOR REPORTING IRREGULARITIES<br><br>To ensure effective implementation, employees should understand what constitutes an irregularity. Employers can create (ideally in cooperation with employees) a catalog of ethical standards, rules for accepting gifts, contractor control procedures, and consistently adhere to and promote them. This offers dual benefits: employees become aware of company rules, and they can report violations without fear of reprisal if done in good faith.<br><br>Company leaders can then address reported irregularities to eliminate them and prevent potential financial or reputational crises.<br><br>Implementing a whistleblower protection system can be formal (establishing procedures) or an opportunity to build a new organizational culture – developing employee engagement in responsible and ethical business growth.<br><br>WHO IS COVERED BY THE DIRECTIVE'S REGULATIONS?<br><br>The new regulations cover all employers with at least 50 employees, regardless of whether they are in the public or private sector.<br><br>For private sector entities with 50 to 249 employees, the implementation deadline may be postponed until December 17, 2023, but for larger employers (250 or more employees), the regulations are effective from December 17, 2021.<br><br>The European Parliament and Council Directive (EU) 2019/1937, EU Directive, directive on the protection of persons reporting violations, Directive on the protection of whistleblowers, GDPR, whistleblowers, Whistleblowing<br><br>Contact us:<br><br>piotr.witek@moorepolska.pl<br>***<br>Summary:<br><br>The Moore Polska Academy highlights the European Parliament and Council Directive (EU) 2019/1937, which mandates member states to implement systems for reporting irregularities, protecting whistleblowers. Despite negative connotations in Poland, the implementation of such systems fosters transparent business practices, builds trust with contractors, and encourages employee engagement. Companies benefit by mitigating risks, enhancing reputation, and preventing potential crises. The directive covers employers with 50 or more employees, with differing implementation deadlines based on company size. By defining irregularities, establishing ethical standards, and ensuring non-retaliation for good-faith reporting, organizations can build a culture of compliance and responsible business growth. A formal approach to whistleblower protection is important, but an opportunity for a new organization culture is even better. Interested parties are invited to contact Moore Polska for further information.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full650" style="display:none;">During the pandemic, remote work became prevalent across many sectors, turning homes into offices for numerous employees. This new arrangement presented both employers and employees with unprecedented challenges and questions. Current remote work guidelines stem from Article 3.1 of the "Crisis Shield," allowing employers to mandate temporary remote work during and up to three months after the COVID-19 state of emergency to combat the virus.<br><br>However, the legislation lacks detailed regulations regarding workplace accidents, health and safety, and reimbursement for home office expenses. Employees often bear additional costs, such as increased energy and internet bills, without clear compensation rules. Employers often attempt to address these issues independently, often including remote work provisions in their work regulations. However, this raises questions about whether such compensation constitutes taxable income for employees.<br><br>Recent interpretations by the Director of the National Fiscal Information have offered clarity on this matter. An interpretation from February 1, 2021, clarified that employers are responsible for providing necessary remote work tools, and employees do not incur taxable income. This applies regardless of whether the employer provides the equipment directly or reimburses the employee for incurred costs. Subsequent interpretations confirmed that reimbursements for equipment, internet, and electricity expenses related to remote work do not constitute employee income.</p>

For those reporting 10 or more insured, rates have changed for specific industries. Increases include fishing (1.47%), mining support services (3.33%), beverage production (1.47%), tobacco production (1.47%), textile production (1.73%), furniture production (1.73%), and air transport (0.93%).<br><br>Decreases occurred in forestry and logging (2.53%), coal mining (3.06%), oil and gas extraction (2.53%), metal ore mining (2.80%), other mining and quarrying (1.73%), clothing production (0.67%), paper production (1.47%), pharmaceutical production (0.93%), metal production (2.26%), waste management and remediation (1.47%), building construction (1.20%), civil engineering (1.47%), water transport (1.47%), warehousing and transport support (1.20%), and rental and leasing (0.93%). Rates for other activities remain unchanged.<br><br>The Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) determines the accident insurance rate for payers required to submit ZUS IWA information and notifies them by April 20, and the information will also be available on PUE ZUS platform. Others determine their rate based on their Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) code. The accident insurance rate varies based on the type of activity, risk category, number of workplace accidents, and number of employees working in hazardous conditions.<br><br>Businesses can reduce their accident insurance rate by analyzing charges, recovering undue payments, implementing preventive measures, and adhering to occupational health and safety regulations. ZUS also offers grant programs to improve workplace safety and reduce hazards, which can be used for technical upgrades, noise and vibration protection, lighting modernization, safety equipment, and more. All sizes of businesses can apply for these grants.</p>

The classification of professions and specialties is a systematic collection of professions and specialties in the labor market. A profession is defined as a set of professional activities, separated as a result of the social division of labor. A specialty is defined as a division of labor within a profession, where certain activities require more in-depth knowledge.<br><br>The regulation does not govern the admission to practice a profession or the standardization of education. Instead, it provides a tool for statistics, employment, job placement, research, analysis, and forecasting related to the labor market. The classification has a hierarchical, five-level structure, grouping individual professions and specialties into elementary, medium, large, and major groups based on similarities in the skills required.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full654" style="display:none;">Dreaming of a special trip, urgent home repairs, or a desired car purchase but lack funds, have poor credit, or fear high-interest loans? A loan from your employer could be the ideal solution, offering more favorable terms than traditional lenders.<br><br>However, remember that providing such support isn't mandatory for employers and may not be available in all companies. Employer loans offer benefits like low or zero interest rates, flexible repayment terms tailored to your financial situation, accessibility without a strong credit history, and quick access to funds.<br><br>On the downside, they might tie you to the company until the loan is repaid. Job loss could trigger immediate full repayment, and your salary will be reduced by the installment amount.<br><br>To obtain such a loan, submit a request specifying the amount and repayment period. The employer can reject the application based on factors like short employment duration. If approved, a written agreement outlining the terms and conditions is essential, including the amount, installments, repayment schedule, and what happens upon job termination.<br><br>Funding typically comes from operating capital, the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS), or Employee Savings and Loan Associations (PKZP).</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full655" style="display:none;">The pandemic caused layoffs, but many companies are now recovering and rehiring staff, including former employees. Legally, several factors must be considered when rehiring.<br><br>Firstly, how long has it been since the previous employment ended? How many fixed-term contracts were previously signed, and for what total duration? Are new preliminary medical examinations and occupational health and safety (BHP) training required? Was the termination due to group layoffs, which trigger specific regulations?<br><br>Regarding probationary periods, the Labor Code allows only one re-employment on a probationary contract for the same position after at least three years since the previous contract ended or expired, as the trial period's purpose is considered fulfilled after the initial employment.<br><br>Fixed-term contracts are limited to 33 months and three contracts between the same parties. All employment periods are counted, regardless of breaks.<br><br>Preliminary medical examinations are waived if the rehire occurs within 30 days for the same position with identical working conditions, provided the employee has a valid medical certificate. However, BHP training is always mandatory before starting work.<br><br>Employee records can be continued if the break in employment was under 10 years, but this mainly applies to employment relationships started after January 1, 2019. Employee records for relationships before that date were stored for 50 years.<br><br>Finally, regarding Employee Capital Plans (PPK), rehired employees are automatically enrolled unless they submit a new opt-out declaration. If the employee has worked for the employer for at least 3 months within the previous 12 months, they are automatically enrolled in PPK upon rehire.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full656" style="display:none;">Due to an amendment to the CIT Act, starting in 2021, the legislator introduced additional restrictions on the possibility of settling tax losses. Until 2020, regulations disallowed loss deduction from prior years following reorganizations. To limit tax avoidance by exploiting another entity's losses, further restrictions were implemented.<br><br>From January 1, 2021, a taxpayer's losses are disregarded when determining taxable income if the taxpayer acquired another entity or a business (or its organized part) through acquisition, contribution or monetary contribution used to purchase the entity/part, resulting in: (1) a complete or partial change in the taxpayer's primary business activity post-acquisition, or (2) at least 25% of the taxpayer's shares being held by entities that didn't hold those shares when the loss was incurred. A taxpayer cannot offset losses if reorganizations meeting these criteria occur, such as acquiring another entity or purchasing a business/organized part.<br><br>Even a partial shift in the taxpayer's main business activity triggers this restriction. Shareholding structure changes can also lead to limitations. These changes risk affecting reorganizations with legitimate economic reasons, not just those seeking tax benefits.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full658" style="display:none;">A judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on March 18, 2021, favors Polish taxpayers involved in intra-EU transactions. The court ruled that Article 86, paragraph 10b, point 2 of the Polish VAT Act contradicts the core principles of the EU's common Value Added Tax system.<br><br>Previously, Polish VAT regulations stipulated that VAT due on intra-EU acquisitions had to be declared in the period the tax liability arose. For deductible VAT, taxpayers maintained neutrality in VAT settlement only if they included the deductible VAT in the same month as the VAT due, within three months of the end of the month the tax liability arose. Failure to meet this deadline resulted in the obligation to declare VAT due in the month of its accrual, while deductible VAT had to be accounted for "on current account" in the month of the actual correction. This often led to taxpayers needing to pay VAT due plus interest.<br><br>The CJEU determined that the Polish national regulation exceeded what was necessary for the correct collection of VAT and the prevention of tax fraud. EU law, therefore, prevents the application of these national provisions. The CJEU's model, which involves recognizing VAT due and deductible VAT in the same period for intra-EU transactions, simplifies current settlements for taxpayers and allows Polish businesses to reclaim paid interest where VAT was settled in a staggered manner.<br><br>While this case specifically concerned intra-EU acquisitions (WNT), its implications could extend to other transactions settled under the reverse-charge mechanism, such as the import of services.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full659" style="display:none;">Accounting departments face numerous questions regarding events occurring after the balance sheet date. These events are defined by National Accounting Standard No. 7 as favorable or unfavorable occurrences that happen after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are approved, and which significantly impact the reported figures. Two conditions must be met: the event information must be received between the start of the new financial year and the approval of the financial statements, and the impact must be material.<br><br>There are two types of post-balance sheet events: those providing evidence of conditions existing at the balance sheet date, and those indicating conditions that arose after the balance sheet date.<br><br>Events that confirm a state at the balance sheet date include sales adjustments, court rulings on provisions, impairment discoveries, final purchase price determinations, post-balance sheet sales of assets at a loss, and error detections. If this information is received before the financial statements are prepared, it's included in the financial year ending on the balance sheet date. If received after preparation but before approval, material impacts require correcting the statements. Insignificant events or those approved are recorded in the period they are received.<br><br>Events indicating post-balance sheet conditions, such as changes in investment market value, dividend declarations, business combinations, significant asset changes, or major liabilities, require disclosure in the notes to the financial statements if they are material. The nature of the event and its estimated financial impact should be described. Insignificant events of this type are not disclosed.</p>

      <h2>Change of Job Position – When and What Tests Are Required?</h2>
      <p class="date">19.03.2021</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full660" style="display:none;">Initial medical examinations are mandatory for individuals hired for a new job and for employees who are transferred to positions with hazardous health factors or difficult working conditions. Employers are legally obligated to ensure that no employee begins work without a current medical certificate confirming their fitness for the specific role and its associated working conditions, as outlined in the referral for the examination.<br><br>A medical certificate is considered current if it reflects the employee's health status on the day they are to commence work in a given position under the specified conditions. Therefore, any change in job role necessitates an initial medical examination *before* the transfer. This obligation arises if the new position involves different hazardous or difficult factors, an increased exposure level to existing factors, or if the work method changes in a way that elevates occupational risks. Examples include operating new equipment, longer work hours, increased stress, radiation exposure, or chemical exposure. When a job change requires such an examination, the referral must detail all hazardous or difficult factors relevant to both the previous and the new role.<br><br>An exception exists where the hazards at the original and new positions are identical, and the only difference is in the scope of tasks. In such cases, repeat examinations are not required. Failure by employers to comply with these medical examination requirements constitutes a misdemeanor against employee rights and workplace safety, potentially resulting in fines ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 PLN, and even civil liability if an employee's health deteriorates due to such negligence. Importantly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the obligation for initial medical examinations, including those related to job changes, remained in effect. In situations where direct access to an authorized physician was limited, other doctors could conduct examinations and issue certificates, potentially via telecommunication systems. Certificates issued under these exceptional circumstances expire 30 days after the epidemic threat status is lifted, unless an epidemic status is declared, or the epidemic is officially ended.</p>

This program, launched on April 18, 2020, aimed to provide financial liquidity to businesses impacted by the pandemic.<br><br>For micro-enterprises (1-9 employees) experiencing a 25% revenue drop due to COVID-19 or facing operational bans, the subvention could be fully waived if they maintained their business activity until December 31, 2021, and preserved their average 2021 employment at the same level as in 2020. Failure to maintain employment levels would result in a partial repayment of the subvention, ranging from 0% to 50% depending on the employment reduction.<br><br>For SMEs (10-249 employees) in affected sectors with a minimum 30% revenue drop in Q4 2020 or Nov-Dec 2020 compared to 2019, the subvention was calculated as 70% of the gross loss. This subvention was conditionally repayable. It became non-refundable at 25% unconditionally and up to an additional 25% based on the company's sales loss over 12 months. Maintaining employment at or above 100% of the previous year's level meant an additional 0% repayment was due, while reductions resulted in proportional repayments. In exceptional cases, the Polish Development Fund could adjust waiver conditions for businesses with significant revenue drops.</p>

An extension is being considered for non-profit organizations, though no specific decision date has been set. Accountants are urged to prepare for the March 31, 2021 deadline for submitting e-Financial Statements, which requires timely information gathering and signatures from all company representatives listed in the National Court Register.<br><br>Under current accounting laws, the management must ensure the annual financial statement is prepared within three months of the balance sheet date and submitted for approval. The statement must be signed by the person responsible for bookkeeping and the unit's management, or all members of a multi-person management body.<br><br>Furthermore, financial statements for 2020 should address the ongoing pandemic.

      <p class="full-content" id="full663" style="display:none;">On February 25, 2021, the Ministry of Finance, Funds, and Regional Policy in Poland published a regulation concerning the exemption from the obligation to appoint a tax representative. This regulation clarifies a crucial point: taxpayers whose place of business or permanent establishment is located in the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) or Norway are no longer required to appoint a tax representative as stipulated in Article 18a of the Value Added Tax Act of March 11, 2004.<br><br>This exemption is due to the existence of administrative cooperation agreements, anti-fraud pacts, and debt recovery arrangements, or similar agreements, concluded with these countries regarding VAT. These provisions allow companies from the UK and Norway to conduct business in Poland under their existing operational frameworks. The regulation became effective on February 26, 2021, but its provisions are retroactive, applying from January 1, 2021. Consequently, entities from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and Norway do not need to act through a tax representative when filing their January 2021 VAT returns. The legal basis for this is the Regulation of the Minister of Finance, Funds, and Regional Policy of February 23, 2021.<br><br>Key takeaways are related to Brexit and tax representation for VAT in Poland.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full664" style="display:none;">Incoterms are a set of rules created by the International Chamber of Commerce to regulate the terms of sale between buyers and sellers in international trade. They are updated every 10 years, with Incoterms 2020 being the current version. There are 11 rules divided into four groups (C, D, E, F), each defining responsibilities for transport organization, cost sharing, risk transfer, and customs clearance.<br><br>Group C rules require the seller to organize and pay for transport, with risk transferring upon shipment. Group D rules obligate the seller to deliver goods to a specified destination. Group E, comprising only EXW, places the minimal responsibility on the seller to make goods available at their premises. Group F rules mean the seller handles export clearance but not transport or insurance costs.<br><br>In accounting, Incoterms are crucial for determining the timing of delivery and, consequently, the point at which a VAT liability arises. For rules like CPT/CIP and FCA, delivery, and thus VAT obligation, occurs when goods are loaded onto the transport. Under DAP, delivery is when goods reach the agreed destination. For EXW, delivery happens when the seller makes goods available to the buyer at the seller's location. Understanding Incoterms is essential for accurate VAT calculations, invoice issuance, and overall financial reporting.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full665" style="display:none;">The primary goal of these legislative changes is to enhance tax transparency for significant players in the Polish market, particularly those with high revenues. Specifically, certain taxpayers are now obligated to prepare and publish information on their tax strategy, detailing their business operations and tax liabilities. This move aims to increase transparency in the tax settlements of major corporate income taxpayers.<br><br>The obligation to report on tax strategy applies to capital groups and other taxpayers whose annual revenue exceeds the equivalent of 50 million euros, converted to PLN based on the National Bank of Poland's average euro exchange rate from the last business day of the year preceding public disclosure.<br><br>Taxpayers must prepare this information in Polish and publish it on their own website or a related entity's website by the end of the twelfth month following the tax year's end. The scope of information includes details on tax compliance processes, cooperation with tax authorities, tax obligations in Poland (including reporting on tax schemes), related-party transactions exceeding 5% of total assets, restructuring plans affecting tax liabilities, and applications for tax rulings. This list is not exhaustive. Failure to comply can result in a fine of up to PLN 250,000. Businesses must also notify the relevant tax office of the website address where this information is published. A key challenge will be distinguishing between confidential business data and information required for public disclosure.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full666" style="display:none;">The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted accounting practices, particularly for the 2020 financial statements. The Accounting Standards Committee (KSR) has issued recommendations to address the complexities of accounting for financial support received due to COVID-19, often referred to as the "Anti-Crisis Shield." These recommendations categorize support based on its economic substance, providing guidance on recognition, presentation, and disclosure.<br><br>Key forms of support include non-repayable cash subsidies, which are recognized as other operating income upon receipt. Forgiveness or reduction of public liabilities increases other operating income. Loan repayment deferrals or extended credit lines necessitate a re-evaluation of liabilities at their settlement amount or amortized cost. Preferential loans are recorded as liabilities and, if forgiven, the forgiven portion becomes other operating income. Financial subsidies from the PFR are recognized as liabilities, with forgiven portions treated as other operating income.<br><br>In presentation, most of this support, including forgiven amounts, is reported as other operating income and linked to the relevant balance sheet item. Specific presentation requirements vary based on the financial statement annex used. Disclosures are crucial if the support significantly impacts the entity's assessment, detailing the nature and amounts of aid received within the "Additional information and explanations" section. This ensures transparency regarding the financial impact of pandemic-related support measures.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full689" style="display:none;">According to Article 5j of the Act of March 4, 1994, on the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS), budgetary units and local government budgetary establishments are obligated to create the fund regardless of the number of employees as of January 1, 2021. For other employers, the obligation depends on the number of employees. Employers with at least 50 full-time employees as of January 1, 2021, or those with 20-49 employees if a trade union requests it, must create the fund. Employers with fewer than 50 employees can decide not to create the fund or pay holiday benefits.<br><br>The Act specifies contributions for employees working in normal and special conditions, as well as for young employees, based on the average monthly wage in the national economy in the second half of 2018, which was PLN 4,134.02. Contribution rates vary: approximately PLN 1,550.26 for normal conditions, PLN 2,067.01 for special conditions, and different amounts for young employees depending on the year of apprenticeship. Additional contributions exist for disabled employees, retirees under the employer's social care, and employers operating nurseries or children's clubs.<br><br>The granting of subsidized services and benefits depends on the individual's living, family, and financial situation. The employer determines the rules and conditions for using the fund's resources in a regulation. Employers obligated to create the fund can reduce the contribution with the agreement of trade unions or employee representatives. Decisions regarding the ZFŚS must be made by the end of January.<br><br>Companies employing fewer than 50 people can introduce holiday benefits, not exceeding PLN 1,550.26 in 2021, paid once a year to employees taking at least 14 consecutive days of vacation. These benefits differ from "vacation under the pear tree" benefits paid by companies with a ZFŚS and are not means-tested. Holiday benefits are exempt from social security contributions, unlike voluntary vacation bonuses.</p>

This is also used when the law specifies an inventory method that is impossible or impractical to implement.<br><br>**Inventory Deadlines and Frequency**<br><br>Inventory deadlines are considered met if conducted within specified periods:<br><br>*   Materials, goods, and finished products in guarded warehouses with quantity-value records: once every two years.<br>*   Real estate classified as fixed assets/investments, other fixed assets, and machinery/equipment under construction in guarded areas: once every four years.<br>*   Goods and materials in retail outlets with value records: once a year.<br>*   Timber in forestry units: once a year.<br><br>For materials, goods, and finished products expensed directly upon purchase or production, inventory must be conducted on the last day of each financial year.

      <h2>Correcting Invoices - No More Acknowledgements of Receipt!</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full691" style="display:none;">Taxpayers will be able to reduce their VAT base due to discounts, price reductions, returns of goods and packaging, and refunds for the settlement period in which the correcting invoice was issued.<br><br>However, the refund is conditional on the taxpayer's documentation, consistent with the established commercial terms, demonstrating that they agreed with the buyer on the conditions for reducing the tax base for the supply of goods or services specified in the correcting invoice, and that the invoice aligns with the documentation.<br><br>If the taxpayer does not possess the required documentation in the settlement period when the correcting invoice was issued, the reduction of the tax base can be made in the settlement period when the taxpayer obtains the documentation. Therefore, taxpayers will not need confirmation of receipt of the correcting invoice.<br><br>Amendments to Article 29a, sections 17 and 18, of the VAT Act are planned, stipulating that when the tax base increases, the adjustment should be made in the settlement period in which the reason for the increase occurred. For exports of goods and intra-community supplies of goods, the increase in the tax base should occur no earlier than in the tax return filed for the settlement period in which these transactions were reported.<br><br>In summary, the VAT base can be lowered due to price adjustments, returns, and refunds, provided sufficient documentation demonstrates agreement with the buyer regarding the reasons for the correction. The reduction can be applied in the period the documentation is obtained. Confirmation of receipt of the correction invoice is not required. Future VAT law adjustments will require the tax base increase to be reported in the period when the reason for the increase occurred, with specific rules for exports and intra-community supplies. The changes aim to provide clarity and flexibility in VAT adjustments related to correcting invoices.</p>

      <h2>Limited partnerships – change in taxation rules</h2>
      <p class="date">17.11.2020</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full692" style="display:none;">In recent years, limited partnerships have been a popular business structure in Poland. According to the Central Statistical Office, the number of limited partnerships increased by 13.3% in 2019 compared to 2018, while all commercial law companies increased by 6.4% in the same period. This popularity stemmed from the limited liability of the limited partner (komandytariusz) and the tax transparency, where only the partners paid income tax.<br><br>However, amendments to the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act, effective January 1, 2021, have changed the tax rules, making limited partnerships CIT payers. General partnerships with non-natural person partners will also be subject to CIT unless they disclose information about their CIT and PIT-paying partners.<br><br>Under the new rules, the general partner (komplementariusz) can deduct a portion of the CIT paid by the partnership from their income tax, offsetting the impact. However, limited partners will effectively face double taxation, both at the partnership level and individually. A tax exemption is provided for the limited partner, amounting to 50% of income from profit sharing, capped at PLN 60,000 annually per partnership, but restrictions apply based on ownership links and management roles. The new rules may apply from May 1, 2021, if the company chooses, while the financial books need to be closed the day before that happens.<br><br>These changes are expected to significantly reduce the popularity of limited partnerships, with businesses potentially shifting to general partnerships or limited liability companies. Legal advice is recommended for navigating these changes and choosing the appropriate legal form.</p>

      <h2>Lump-sum income tax - changes</h2>
      <p class="date">12.11.2020</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary694">On October 28, 2020, the Council of Ministers approved a bill amending the laws on personal income tax, corporate income tax, and lump-sum income tax on certain income earned by individuals, among oth</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full694" style="display:none;">On October 28, 2020, the Council of Ministers approved a bill amending the laws on personal income tax, corporate income tax, and lump-sum income tax on certain income earned by individuals, among other laws. The law introduces changes to the regulations concerning the registered lump-sum tax. Key updates include increased income limits, revised tax rates, and the extension of lump-sum taxation to rental income from business activities, all effective from 2021.<br><br>The Ministry anticipates these changes will benefit taxpayers by enhancing the attractiveness of the lump-sum taxation method and broadening the range of taxpayers eligible to use it. Lump-sum taxation involves paying tax at a fixed percentage rate on total income, without deductions for business expenses, although income can be reduced by paid social security contributions.<br><br>Specifically, the changes increase the income threshold for electing the lump-sum tax and for making quarterly payments. The eligibility limit for using this form of taxation will rise from 250,000 to 2 million euros. The law also modifies several lump-sum tax rates, introducing new rates depending on the income source, such as 17%, 15%, 12.5%, 10%, 8.5%, 3%, and 2%. Furthermore, it eliminates many cases where specific activities disqualify taxpayers from using the lump-sum. Entrepreneurs engaged in activities currently excluded from this form of taxation will now be eligible. The definition of "free professions" eligible for lump-sum taxation will be updated to include legal, accounting, tax advisory, and rental services. The regulations also unify the lump-sum rate for rental and accommodation services and taxpayers renting properties as part of their business activity will be able to tax them with a flat-rate income tax. Most of these provisions are set to take effect on January 1, 2021.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full695" style="display:none;">Reserves are presented in the liabilities section of the balance sheet, specifically under "Provisions for Liabilities." This includes reserves for deferred income tax, retirement and similar benefits, and other reserves. Retirement and other reserves, along with other reserves are further divided into long-term and short-term portions. Deferred income tax reserves are always classified as long-term, regardless of their utilization timeframe.<br><br>Long-term reserves are those expected to be used beyond 12 months from the balance sheet date, while short-term reserves are anticipated to be used within that 12-month period. Deferred income tax reserves are created due to temporary differences that will increase the future income tax base.<br><br>Reserves for retirement benefits encompass all significant employee benefits arising from legal regulations, collective agreements, or employment contracts, excluding restructuring reserves. Companies also create reserves for unused vacation time or management bonuses tied to profits. Restructuring reserves cover costs associated with significant changes in operations, such as personnel reductions or facility closures, only recognized when there is a commitment to restructure and costs can be reliably estimated.<br><br>Other reserves include accruals for probable and material operating costs with uncertain timing, like warranty repairs or environmental remediation. Reserves for losses cover unfavorable events, such as guarantees or pending lawsuits. Specific accounting treatment for VAT, social security, and other public liabilities may vary based on differing theories, which must be disclosed in accounting policies. The additional information must provide specifics like purpose, opening balance, increases, usage, reversals and closing balance of reserves. It also includes obligation descriptions, uncertainty disclosures, key assumptions and anticipated asset returns.</p>

      <h2>How to avoid mistakes when applying 50% tax-deductible expenses for creators?</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full696" style="display:none;">To qualify compensation as a royalty and apply 50% deductible expenses, the following conditions must be met: a copyrighted work must be created, objective evidence confirming its creation must exist, and the royalty for the work must be clearly separated from other salary components. These 50% deductible expenses apply exclusively to creators in fields like architecture, literature, music, computer programming, journalism, scientific and artistic endeavors.<br><br>Copyright law protects any original, individual expression of creative activity, regardless of its form, value, or purpose. Royalties under employment or civil law contracts can also qualify for the 50% deductible expenses.<br><br>To establish a royalty for work performed under an employment contract, the contract must differentiate between the royalty component and the employee duties component. Detailing the time spent on creative work as a percentage is insufficient. The royalty must be linked to the creation of a specific work or works. Documentation of copyright income and its amount is required and can be proven by any legally admissible evidence. Examples of evidence include records of created works, declarations documenting the creation of a specific work, or time records linked to a specific work. The annual deductible expense limit for copyright royalties in 2020 was PLN 85,528.00. This limit is capped annually.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full697" style="display:none;">Labor inspectors, authorized to conduct inspections, have broad powers including unrestricted access to premises, the ability to inspect facilities, workplaces, machinery, and work processes, and the right to demand information (written and oral) from employers, employees, and those working under other arrangements. They can summon and interrogate individuals, request documents related to construction, plant modernization, and operation, and demand samples of raw materials. Inspectors can also review personnel files, verify identities, use expert assistance, and conduct unannounced inspections at any time to check compliance with labor laws, particularly regarding safety and health, legality of employment, minimum hourly wage, and restrictions on Sunday trading. They don't need permission to enter a controlled site.<br><br>Employers are required to maintain an inspection logbook. Common inspection areas include the legality of employment, working hours, vacation usage, wage calculations, parental rights, and workplace safety and health. Internal audits are recommended to prepare for potential inspections by identifying and addressing any non-compliance issues. Creating a safe work environment and having a well-trained administrative staff ensures proper compliance.</p>

However, it excludes overtime pay, seniority bonuses, retirement and disability severance pay, and jubilee awards. The minimum hourly rate for contractors applies to contracts of mandate and service contracts under the Civil Code for each hour of service. These contracts are used for temporary work by individuals not running their own business, or running a business but not employing staff or subcontracting.<br><br>If the employment or mandate contract states a specific amount, an addendum reflecting the new minimum wage is required. If the contract states the wage is "minimum" without specifying an amount, an addendum isn't needed. To avoid updating contracts with each minimum wage change, include a clause specifying that the employee receives the current minimum wage as defined by the Act of October 10, 2002, on the minimum wage for work, which means the wage automatically increases with the minimum rate.</p>

The TPR form replaces the previous CIT-TP and PIT-TP reports.<br><br>Related entities are obligated to submit the TPR form if they engage in transactions subject to transfer pricing documentation requirements, transactions with entities located in tax havens, and domestic transactions between entities that did not incur losses in the tax year and were exempt from preparing transfer pricing documentation. Even if entities are exempt from preparing documentation, they are still required to submit the TPR form.<br><br>The form is submitted electronically to the Head of the National Revenue Administration and must be signed by the head of the entity or an authorized representative. The TPR form requires detailed information about transactions with related parties, including the results of comparability analyses and financial indicators such as operating margin, gross profit margin, return on assets, and return on equity. Taxpayers will directly provide the Head of the National Revenue Administration with detailed information about transactions with related parties. Taxpayers can refer to the explanations on how to prepare the transfer pricing information and the Ministry of Finance's draft document "TPR: Questions and Answers" for guidance. Preparing the TPR form can be time-consuming and problematic, so it should not be left to the last minute.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full715" style="display:none;">A draft law amending income tax acts for individuals and corporations, as well as the flat-rate income tax act, has been published. The government aims to tighten the corporate and individual income tax systems, linking tax amounts paid by large, especially multinational, companies to their actual income location. The draft addresses loopholes in CIT, sparking concern among taxpayers.<br><br>The proposed solutions include extending CIT to limited partnerships and undisclosed general partnerships in Poland, facilitating tax recovery on real estate company share sales by non-residents. It also mandates public tax policy disclosure for select corporate income taxpayers and modifies transfer pricing rules. Adjustments are made for the Polish economy, particularly concerning debt financing and tax policy. Furthermore, the draft aims to align depreciation cost recognition with accounting principles and international standards for determining balance sheet profits or losses.<br><br>The draft seeks to address tax optimization structures using limited partnerships, grant limited partnerships corporate income taxpayer status, ensure verification of settlements by general partnership members, and raise the revenue limit for the 9% CIT rate from €1.2 million to €2 million to support SMEs. The plan is to adopt the draft in Q3 2020.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full716" style="display:none;">On August 25, 2020, the President signed a law from February 14, 2020, amending certain laws to promote healthier consumer choices. This law introduces a "sugar tax" on sweetened and energy drinks, consisting of a fixed charge of 50 gr per liter for drinks with added sugar or sweeteners, 10 gr per liter for those with active substances like caffeine or taurine, and a variable charge of 5 gr per gram of sugar above 5g/100ml. Entities selling drinks to retail outlets or ordering drinks for production are responsible for paying this fee monthly and submitting electronic reports. Late payments incur an additional charge of 50% of the due amount. Revenue from the sugar tax goes to the National Health Fund (96.5%) and the state budget (3.5%).<br><br>The law also amends regulations on alcoholic beverages, introducing a fee for selling alcohol in containers of 300ml or less. This amounts to 25 zł per liter of pure alcohol sold in such small packages. Wholesale alcohol distributors are responsible for calculating and paying this fee semi-annually. Failure to pay incurs penalties of 2000 zł or 11,250 zł depending on the alcohol content of the wholesale permit. Revenue from this alcohol fee is split equally between local municipalities and the National Health Fund. Both the sugar tax and the alcohol fee are set to take effect on January 1, 2021.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full717" style="display:none;">Employee documentation includes personnel files maintained separately for each employee and documents related to employment relationships. Personnel files, since January 1, 2019, are divided into four parts: A, B, C, and D, containing documents related to the job application, employment, termination, and disciplinary actions, respectively. Alongside personnel files, employers must maintain documentation related to employment relationships, including records of work hours, vacation requests, wage payments, and allocation of work clothing and protective equipment.<br><br>The retention period for employee documentation depends on the date the employment relationship began. For relationships started on or after January 1, 2019, the retention period is 10 years. For relationships started between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2018, the retention period is either 10 years if the employer submitted a specific information report, or 50 years if they did not. For relationships started before December 31, 1998, the retention period is also 50 years, unless the report was submitted.<br><br>Employers can choose to maintain documentation in either paper or electronic form, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, completeness, and accessibility while protecting against damage or destruction. Failure to maintain, store, or properly handle employee documentation can result in fines ranging from PLN 1,000 to PLN 30,000.</p>

Meeting these conditions allows for simplification, regardless of whether the entity is classified as a small entity. To implement these simplifications, a relevant provision must be included in the accounting policies.

      <p class="full-content" id="full725" style="display:none;">Polish law regarding IP Box (Intellectual Property Box) is outlined in the PIT (Personal Income Tax) and CIT (Corporate Income Tax) acts. Qualified intellectual property rights include patents, utility model protection rights, industrial design registration rights, integrated circuit topography registration rights, supplementary protection certificates for medicinal or plant protection products, rights from registering medicinal and veterinary medicinal products, exclusive rights under the Plant Variety Protection Act, and copyrights to computer programs.<br><br>To utilize the IP Box relief, companies must conduct research and development activities, defined as creative activities encompassing scientific research or development work undertaken systematically to increase knowledge resources and utilize them for new applications. The tax base is the sum of qualified income from these rights.<br><br>Companies seeking IP Box benefits must maintain clear accounting records confirming R&D projects to calculate the tax base. Tax explanations from July 15, 2019, emphasize detailed records for each R&D project, including project description, start and end dates, involved personnel, and tasks with assigned individuals. These records help calculate cost/income proportions for projects qualifying for the relief. The Finance Ministry recommends requesting individual tax interpretations, but the response time is currently extended to six months due to the anti-crisis shield, suggesting an early application.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full726" style="display:none;">The Polish Development Fund (PFR) financial shield support is available to businesses employing 1-9 employees (micro-enterprises) with an annual turnover or balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 2 million, or those employing up to 249 employees with turnover under EUR 50 million or a balance sheet total under EUR 43 million, excluding micro-enterprises. Applicants must demonstrate a revenue decrease of at least 25% in any month since February 2020 compared to the previous month or the same month in 2019 due to COVID-19. They must be active on the application date, not in liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings, have tax residency in Poland, have operated as of December 31, 2019, and not have outstanding tax or social security payments as of December 31, 2019, or the funding date.<br><br>Funding is applied for through banks cooperating with PFR. Up to 75% of the funds may be non-refundable if program conditions are met. For micro-enterprises, conditions include continuing operations for 12 months (25% forgiveness) and maintaining average employment (up to 50% forgiveness). For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), an additional condition is reporting a loss on sales (25% forgiveness), alongside the other two. Funds can only cover business operating costs, including salaries, goods/services, external financing costs, public liabilities, rent, fixed asset purchases, and repayment of existing loans (up to 25% of the subsidy). Funds cannot be used for transactions with related parties, share acquisitions for redemption, mergers/acquisitions, or early loan repayments exceeding 25% of the subsidy.<br><br>For accounting purposes, the Finance Ministry views the subsidy as a loan. While the subsidy is tax-exempt, any forgiven amount constitutes taxable income. Expenses covered by the subsidy are tax-deductible.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full727" style="display:none;">The interpellation concerns the tax treatment of financial aid provided to businesses and entrepreneurs, specifically focusing on whether loans are taxable as income, if loan forgiveness constitutes taxable income, the tax implications of the one-time 5000 zł loan, and the deductibility of ZUS contributions that were waived. The inquiry also questions the lack of clarity regarding the tax treatment of these aid programs and asks if the ministry plans to introduce tax exemptions to ensure the aid is truly beneficial.<br><br>Deputy Finance Minister Jan Sarnowski responded, clarifying that financial assistance from the Polish Development Fund (PFR) is treated as a loan, not income. Receiving the loan is tax-neutral. However, any forgiven portion of the loan is considered taxable income. The Ministry is considering partial tax exemptions for these loan forgiveness amounts in 2021. As for the one-time 5000 zł loan for micro-entrepreneurs, while receiving the loan is tax-neutral, the COVID-19 act specifically exempts the forgiven amount from income tax. Regarding waived ZUS contributions, these cannot be deducted as expenses because they were not paid by the entrepreneur. However, the waiver itself is exempt from income tax. The Ministry of Finance's position on other forms of aid can be found in official communications.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full728" style="display:none;">It's time to consider and prepare for the upcoming changes to the JPK_VAT (Standard Audit File for Tax) reporting, despite the simplification, new obligations have been introduced. These include providing additional data, such as special codes (GTU codes) for specific goods and services listed in a catalog of 13 items (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, electronics, waste, vehicles, buildings, transport, consulting). Additionally, certain transaction types, like those subject to mandatory split payment or transactions with related parties, must be marked.<br><br>Taxpayers must analyze these new requirements. For instance, the mandatory split payment (MPP) applies when an invoice exceeds 15,000 PLN and includes items from Annex 15 of the VAT Act. Currently, taxpayers often mark "split payment mechanism" on every invoice exceeding 15,000 PLN, which might now be considered an error if it's not obligatory MPP.<br><br>Starting October 1st, a penalty of 500 PLN per error "preventing verification of transaction correctness" may be imposed. Incorrectly indicating a GTU code could be considered such an error. Therefore, it's advised to review the new JPK_VAT requirements and prepare for the changes taking effect on October 1, 2020.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full729" style="display:none;">Significantly, a request for a Binding Rate Information (WIS) ruling can pertain to transactions involving goods and services listed in Annex 15 of the VAT Act, subject to mandatory split payment, and goods whose trading prevents the application of the subjective exemption listed in Annex 12 of the VAT Act. Establishing the correct classification of goods according to the Combined Nomenclature (CN) or services according to the Polish Classification of Products and Services (PKWiU) is crucial in these regulations.<br><br>The applicant for a WIS ruling can be a VAT-registered taxpayer or any entity engaged in or intending to engage in the supply or import of goods, intra-Community acquisition of goods, or provision of services, as well as a contracting authority under the Public Procurement Law, affecting price calculation in public procurement.<br><br>The application must include a detailed description of the goods or services, enabling identification according to CN or PKWiU, and specify the classification system to be used. Documents like photos, plans, instructions, formulas, certificates, or manufacturer information can be attached to facilitate accurate classification by the Director of the National Fiscal Information.<br><br>The application fee is PLN 40, multiplied by the number of goods and services comprising a complex service. The WIS-W application form has been in effect since November 1, 2019. A WIS ruling should be issued without undue delay, within three months of application.<br><br>A WIS ruling includes a description of the goods or services, their classification according to CN, PKOB or PKWiU 2015, and the applicable VAT rate. It guarantees that tax authorities cannot impose late payment interest, initiate proceedings for tax crimes or offenses, challenge the VAT rate applied based on the WIS, or obligate the taxpayer to pay tax.</p>

      <h2>Shield 4.0 – Further Changes in PIT and CIT</h2>
      <p class="date">29.06.2020</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full730" style="display:none;">According to Article 16 section 1 point 22 of the Corporate Income Tax Act (and Article 23 section 1 point 19 of the Personal Income Tax Act respectively), the following are not considered tax-deductible expenses:<br><br>Contractual penalties and compensation for defects in delivered goods, performed works and services, as well as delays in delivering defect-free goods or delays in removing defects in goods or performed works and services.<br><br>The above provision will not apply to paid contractual penalties and compensation if the defect in delivered goods, performed works and services, and delays in delivering defect-free goods or delays in removing defects in goods or performed works and services, arose in connection with a state of epidemic threat or a state of epidemic, announced due to COVID-19.<br><br>The bad debt relief is even more beneficial for creditors.<br><br>From January 1, 2020, the bad debt relief was introduced into the Personal Income Tax Act and the Corporate Income Tax Act for creditors. Taxpayers can reduce the income constituting the basis for the advance payment by the value of receivables included in revenue that has not been settled or sold, when 90 days have passed from the payment deadline specified on the invoice (bill) or in the contract, until the period in which the receivable was settled or sold (Article 25 section 19 point 1 of the Corporate Income Tax Act, Article 44 section 17 point 1 of the Personal Income Tax Act). The Anti-Crisis Shield 4.0 indicates that in 2020, the right to reduce the income constituting the basis for calculating the advance payment is granted starting from the settlement period in which 30 days have passed from the payment deadline.<br><br>This possibility will also be provided for taxpayers who have chosen a simplified form of paying advances for 2020. They will be able to reduce the advance due for the month in which 30 days have passed from the payment deadline:<br><br>1) in the case of CIT taxpayers by:<br><br>9% of the value of the receivable - in the case of a small taxpayer or 19% of the value of the receivable - in the case of other taxpayers,<br><br>2) in the case of PIT taxpayers by:<br><br>17% of the value of the receivable - in the case of a taxpayer settling according to the tax scale or<br><br>19% of the value of the receivable - in the case of a taxpayer taxed linearly.<br><br>If the value of the reduction of the advance due is higher than this advance, then the advance due can be reduced by the un-deducted value for subsequent months.<br><br>Note!<br><br>The above facilities apply to settlement periods in which the taxpayer incurred negative economic consequences due to COVID-19, as referred to in the COVID-19 Act.<br><br>The above changes do not apply to debtors.<br><br>CIT, PIT, Shield 4.0<br><br>The text outlines changes to Polish tax regulations. Contractual penalties and compensations related to defective goods or services are generally not tax-deductible. However, an exception is made if the defect or delay resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the "bad debt relief" has become more favorable for creditors. Starting January 1, 2020, creditors can reduce their income tax base by the value of unsettled receivables after a certain period. Initially, this period was 90 days, but it was shortened to 30 days in 2020 due to the Anti-Crisis Shield 4.0, with specific reduction percentages depending on the taxpayer's income tax bracket (CIT or PIT) and size. The reduced period applies to taxpayers experiencing negative economic consequences from COVID-19 and not debtors.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full731" style="display:none;">The "Anti-Crisis Shield 4.0" in Poland introduces new regulations concerning the control of entrepreneurs, alongside financial aid measures. Article 53 modifies the Law on Entrepreneurs, allowing for remote controls with the entrepreneur's consent. This enables authorities to conduct audits via postal service or electronic communication if it streamlines the process or suits the business's nature.<br><br>The legislator aims to make controls more flexible, addressing entrepreneurs' concerns about disruptions. Remote audits are applicable when physical presence isn't necessary, documentation can be analyzed remotely, or the remote approach is more efficient.<br><br>Tax authorities must still notify entrepreneurs of planned audits at least 7 days prior, as per the Tax Ordinance, unless the entrepreneur consents to a faster audit or specific circumstances allow unannounced checks. The possibility of a remote audit depends entirely on the entrepreneur's consent. Without it, a remote audit cannot occur.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full732" style="display:none;">The Anti-Crisis Shield 4.0 introduces facilitations regarding the validity of residency certificates during the COVID-19 state of epidemic threat and epidemic, extending two months after their cancellation. A copy of the residency certificate can be used to confirm the taxpayer's residence for tax purposes if its information doesn't raise doubts about its accuracy. For certificates without an expiration date, expiring within the epidemic period, payers can consider them valid throughout the epidemic and two months after. Furthermore, the requirement for the payer to obtain a residency certificate from the taxpayer is also considered fulfilled if the payer possesses a certificate covering 2019 and a statement from the taxpayer confirming the data's current accuracy.<br><br>The deadline for submitting information on transfer pricing and declarations regarding local transfer pricing documentation is extended to December 31, 2020, if the original deadline falls between March 31 and September 30, 2020. For deadlines between October 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021, the extension is three months. The deadline for attaching group transfer pricing documentation to the local file is also extended to the end of the third month following the deadline for submitting the local documentation declaration.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full742" style="display:none;">Don't panic, but acknowledge the serious situation and its uncertain future. While economic activity is slowly resuming in China outside of quarantined areas, maintain a critical perspective on media reports, remembering that expert predictions are often inaccurate. Calmly analyze your business without making rash decisions, as your clients are watching. Utilize existing resources as needed.<br><br>Review fixed costs, cutting non-essential expenses like subscriptions or excessive marketing, but carefully consider the impact before eliminating services entirely. Renegotiate contracts for rent and services if your transaction volume decreases significantly. Analyze variable costs and identify alternative suppliers. Reduce inventory by selling surplus items to generate cash flow. Consider selling or leasing out unnecessary assets to improve liquidity.<br><br>Explore options for loans and deferring payments. Communicate proactively with your bank about your situation to improve negotiation leverage. Optimize leases by postponing payments or transferring agreements. Consider sale-leaseback options if financial difficulties arise. Defer all possible payments, including taxes and supplier debts, until your business recovers.<br><br>Maintain open communication with suppliers and clients to build trust and keep them informed about your plans. Monitor competitors and larger companies for innovative solutions. Avoid expensive financing options like credit cards and factoring. Identify and prioritize key resources, considering outsourcing non-essential functions.<br><br>Analyze how the crisis will impact your transaction volume and adjust your organization accordingly. Explore options for employees, such as furloughs or using accrued vacation time. Consider reorganization or reduced salaries, in consultation with your employees. Collaborate with other businesses to share resources and employees. Consider how you can support your customers, such as payment deferrals or equipment rentals. Pay attention to government support programs as the EU will financially assist countries in response to the coronavirus pandemic and companies may benefit from this support.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full745" style="display:none;">This article discusses the tax implications of Employee Capital Plans (PPK) in Poland, focusing on contributions, financing entities, and withdrawals. Employer-funded contributions, both mandatory and voluntary, are considered taxable income for the employee and subject to standard income tax. However, government subsidies, including the initial welcome bonus of 250 PLN and annual payments of 240 PLN, are tax-exempt. Employee contributions are deducted from their after-tax salary.<br><br>An example illustrates how PPK contributions affect net pay. Although employees contribute 2% of their gross salary, their net pay decreases by over 3% due to the TEE (Taxed, Exempt, Exempt) model, where employer contributions are taxed upfront. This has led to calls for "grossing up" employer contributions to offset the impact on net pay, which employers resist, arguing it would unfairly shift the financial burden entirely to them. Another point of contention is that bonuses and rewards are included in the gross salary calculation for PPK contributions. While the TEE system results in immediate tax on contributions, future income from withdrawals is tax-exempt. Some PPK participants are skeptical about this arrangement, though government subsidies partially compensate for the lack of upfront tax benefits.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full746" style="display:none;">My dear friends,<br><br>We are slowly closing and settling the year 2019, a year that REWIT will primarily remember as the 25th anniversary of its existence. It became clear how connected we are with Gdańsk and Pomerania. A quarter of a century is a long time – we have survived various trials and fulfilled many dreams and aspirations.<br><br>The founder of the company, my mother – Lucyna Witek – probably did not anticipate that after 25 years we would achieve such success: over 500 clients annually, over 12.6 million PLN in consolidated revenues, 8 offices in Poland, 140 employees, 14th position on the market in the ranking of all audit firms, high growth dynamics. Today we are a medium-sized audit firm, providing a wide range of services to our clients.<br><br>How do we assess these 25 years? Certainly as a time of successes, challenges, and constant changes. We have made many mistakes, gained many strong experiences, searched and made further attempts. However, these experiences are our wealth. They guarantee that we approach our clients' matters with respect and understanding. In 2019, which will be recorded with almost 10% revenue growth in the entire REWIT group, we tried to start the process of standardization and change of the company to better respond to the changing needs of the market.<br><br>The year 2019 was also marked by numerous challenges for us and our clients, mainly changes in tax law, introducing even greater uncertainty among our clients. We strive to support you in tax, reporting, and business matters.<br><br>We want to be an organization that supports medium-sized businesses in their development, we want to be partners who share experiences and best practices. We also want to create a good workplace for the development of all employees and collaborators.<br><br>Thank you to all those who have trusted us. Thank you to all members of the "REWIT family": employees and partners who support our business with their work, development and empathy. Finally, thank you to our families for showing understanding when we happen to put business above other needs.<br><br>The year 2020 is already underway. We know that it will be a very busy period. We have new ambitious goals and challenges ahead of us this year. We hope they will open doors to new international development prospects in the next decade.<br><br>REWIT is celebrating its 25th anniversary, marking a period of substantial growth and evolution from a small firm to a mid-sized audit organization with 8 offices, 140 employees, and over 500 clients, achieving significant revenue milestones and ranking among the top audit firms in Poland. The company acknowledges the challenges and successes of the past, emphasizing its commitment to understanding and supporting its clients through fluctuating market conditions and tax law changes. A key focus is on team building, providing expert advisory services, and fostering a supportive work environment. REWIT aims to be a partner in the growth of medium-sized businesses, sharing best practices and creating opportunities for employee development while expressing gratitude to clients, employees, partners, and families for their trust and support. The company anticipates a busy and ambitious year ahead, focusing on international expansion and continued organizational development.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full747" style="display:none;">Effective January 1, 2020, Article 61b § 1 of the Tax Ordinance mandates that payments for Personal Income Tax (PIT), Corporate Income Tax (CIT), Value Added Tax (VAT), and non-tax budgetary dues be made to the tax office using an individual tax account. This individual tax account is referred to as a "mikrorachunek podatkowy." Tax refunds will continue to be processed under the existing rules.<br><br>Taxpayers can generate and verify their individual tax account using an online generator or by visiting a tax office, providing either their PESEL (for individuals) or NIP (for businesses). The account consists of 26 characters, with the digits 10100071222 followed by the taxpayer's PESEL or NIP in positions 3 and onward.<br><br>The existing tax office accounts for PIT, CIT, and VAT payments will remain active until December 31, 2019. After this date, all such payments must be made to the taxpayer's "mikrorachunek podatkowy." Other taxes should still be paid using the previous methods.<br><br>In summary, Poland is introducing a new system using individual tax accounts ("mikrorachunek podatkowy") for paying PIT, CIT, and VAT, starting January 1, 2020. Taxpayers must use these accounts instead of the old tax office accounts for these specific taxes. The account number is easily generated using an online tool or by visiting a tax office, using either PESEL or NIP. This new system aims to streamline tax payments. Payments for other taxes will still be made as before. Existing tax office accounts for PIT, CIT, and VAT will be deactivated after December 31, 2019.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full750" style="display:none;">The amendment introduces a new tax scale effective January 1, 2020, applicable to all taxpayers with income taxed under general rules, including pensioners and entrepreneurs not using linear tax or a lump sum. For the period October-December 2019, a transitional tax rate of 17.75% is applied. When calculating advance tax payments for income earned from October 1 to December 31, 2019, a 17% rate is used instead of 18%, with a tax-reducing amount of 525.12 PLN. Taxpayers can request a 17.75% rate instead.<br><br>For those calculating advances as self-employed individuals, the tax-reducing amount from October 1, 2019, is 548.30 PLN, using the 17.75% rate. This applies not only to entrepreneurs but also to income from lease or special agricultural production if books are kept.<br><br>The tax-reducing amount for the new tax scale varies depending on the tax base, ranging from 1360 PLN to a reduced amount for income exceeding certain thresholds. An increased tax-deductible expense will be applied.The law also increases monthly and annual employee costs. These changes benefit over 25 million Poles, reducing the tax wedge and lowering labor costs.<br><br>A worker earning the minimum wage (2250 PLN) will gain 472 PLN annually, while someone earning the average wage (4765 PLN) will gain 732 PLN.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full751" style="display:none;">1. A taxpayer receiving funds on their 16th birthday who has declared exemption from taxation is eligible for the exemption on income paid that day if they are under 26. The exemption applies to income received until the age of 26, including income received on the 26th birthday.<br><br>2. The Ministry of Finance is planning to amend the PIT-11 form. Work on the draft regulation is in progress, and the draft will be available on the Government Legislation Centre's Public Information Bulletin when it is submitted for consultations and opinions.<br><br>3a. The income limit for tax exemption (PLN 35,636.67 in 2019 and PLN 85,582 from 2020) refers to gross income, not reduced by revenue-generating expenses or deductions from income. However, income subject to lump-sum tax, tax-exempt income, and income with tax collection waived are excluded from this limit.<br><br>3b. When calculating payroll with both salary and ZUS benefits, the tax advance for benefits is calculated without deducting revenue-generating expenses.<br><br>3c. If the exemption limit is exceeded during a tax month, the excess is taxed from the month the exemption eligibility is lost.<br><br>3d. If an individual turns 26 during the year, income received up to their 26th birthday is tax-exempt, while income received afterwards is taxed.<br><br>3e. Exceeding both the exemption limit and the tax threshold are independent events.<br><br>3f. If an employee under 26 works for multiple employers and submits exemption declarations to all, but collectively exceeds the limit, they must calculate the tax due in their tax return. The amount of social security and health insurance contributions deductible from income and tax is determined based on the proportion of exempt income to total income, and information will be included in tax return brochures.<br><br>4a. A payer can deduct revenue-generating expenses from income not exempt due to exceeding the limit.<br><br>4b. Restrictions mentioned in Art. 22 para. 3b and para. 9aa of the PIT Act also apply when collecting tax advances.<br><br>4c. Art. 23 para. 1 point 31 of the PIT Act does not preclude deducting employee wages exempt from taxation as business expenses for the employer because the employee's income is exempt, not the employer's.<br><br>These explanations are based on the response of the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Tadeusz Kościński, on September 5, 2019, to the letter of the Tax Council of the Lewiatan Confederation of August 23, 2019 and do not constitute an official interpretation of tax law.<br><br>## Summary<br><br>The Polish Ministry of Finance clarified several aspects of the tax exemption for individuals under 26. The exemption applies to income received until the 26th birthday, even if received on that day. The Ministry is planning amendments to the PIT-11 form. The income limit for the exemption is gross income, excluding income subject to lump-sum tax, tax-exempt income, and income with waived tax collection. Tax advances on ZUS benefits are calculated without deducting revenue-generating expenses. If the exemption limit is exceeded, the excess is taxed from that month onwards. Individuals turning 26 during the year are only exempt up to their birthday. The exemption limit operates independently of the tax threshold. For employees working for multiple employers and exceeding the collective exemption limit, the deductible social security and health insurance contributions are determined proportionally. Payers can deduct revenue-generating expenses from income not exempt due to exceeding the limit, and certain restrictions apply. The exemption does not preclude deducting exempt employee wages as business expenses for the employer.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full752" style="display:none;">The "white list" of taxpayers is a register of VAT payers maintained by the Head of the Tax Office, encompassing both entities registered for VAT, including those whose registration was restored, and those not registered or removed from the VAT registry. Accessible via the Public Information Bulletin on the Ministry of Finance's website and the Central Registration and Information on Business, it allows verification of a subject's status for any day within the preceding five years. This unified database contains extended information, including bank account numbers listed in identification or update forms, aiming to simplify counterparty verification.<br><br>The register includes company names, tax identification numbers, VAT status, REGON and PESEL numbers, KRS numbers, addresses, details of representatives, registration dates, legal basis for registration/deregistration, and bank account numbers. Taxpayers should verify that the recipient's bank account matches the one listed before making payments. The list is updated daily on business days. Verifying counterparties is crucial for VAT deduction, and the list aids in demonstrating due diligence.<br><br>From January 2020, failure to verify the white list carries consequences under income tax laws. Payments to accounts not listed could result in joint liability for the supplier's unpaid VAT and the inability to deduct the expense for income tax purposes for transactions exceeding PLN 15,000. A notification within 3 days of payment to an unlisted account can avoid these consequences. A new provision introduces joint and several liability for VAT arrears if payments are made to unlisted accounts.</p>

However, as the exemption was effective from August 1, 2019, the limit for 2019 was PLN 35,636.67. Income below these limits is exempt from PIT. The exemption applies regardless of the number of contracts or payers. Only income exceeding the limit is subject to taxation.<br><br>The regulations came into effect on August 1, 2019, and apply to income earned from that date. Salary for July paid in August is eligible for the exemption. In 2019, the exemption could be applied in two ways. A higher net salary was possible if the young taxpayer submitted a statement to the employer confirming their income was fully exempt from PIT. Otherwise, the tax refund could be claimed in the annual tax return. From January 1, 2020, the exemption is automatically applied when calculating tax advances, without needing a statement.<br><br>The PIT exemption for young people does not exempt them from paying social security (ZUS) and health insurance (NFZ) contributions.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full754" style="display:none;">The Polish government is processing an amendment to the VAT law concerning the 0% VAT rate for intra-Community transactions, chain transactions, and call-off stock arrangements. These changes introduce material conditions for applying the 0% VAT rate on intra-Community supplies, focusing on the buyer's valid VAT identification number and the accurate submission of summary information by the supplier.<br><br>Effective January 1, 2020, Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1912 mandates proper proof of goods' export from one member state to another to qualify for the 0% rate. For instance, if a third party handles the transport, the seller must possess at least two consistent documents, such as a CMR and a carrier's invoice, issued by independent entities unrelated to the buyer and seller.<br><br>Regarding chain transactions, the concept of an intermediary entity will be introduced, allowing the attribution of goods' dispatch or transport to deliveries made to that entity, which is crucial for determining the reporting obligations of each party involved. The new regulations replace existing rules on consignment warehouses with new procedures for call-off stock, where goods are intended for a specific recipient. Goods stored in a call-off stock exceeding 12 months without being retrieved will trigger a tax liability for the supplier. The changes will take effect on January 1, 2020.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full755" style="display:none;">The text discusses the tax implications of Employee Capital Plans (PPK) in Poland, focusing on contributions made by employers, the state, and employees. Employer-funded contributions are considered taxable income, subject to general income tax rules. State contributions, including the welcome bonus and annual top-ups, are tax-exempt. Employee contributions are deducted from net salary, meaning they are made after income tax has been applied.<br><br>An example illustrates how PPK contributions affect an employee's net pay. Even though the basic contribution is 2% of gross salary, the net salary decreases by over 3% due to the taxation model where the employer's contribution is taxed. This leads to calls for employers to "gross up" salaries to compensate for the employee contributions. Employers are reluctant to do so, arguing that it would place the entire financial burden of PPK on them, contrary to the law's intention of shared responsibility. The calculation of the PPK contribution base includes bonuses and awards, which adds to the financial impact on employees.<br><br>PPK, along with other third-pillar pension schemes, operates under a TEE (taxed, exempt, exempt) model, where contributions are made from taxed income, but future payouts are tax-free. While the lack of immediate tax benefits raises concerns among some, state subsidies partially offset this. The article concludes with an invitation to contact the author for more information.</p>

Micro, small, medium, and large enterprises are eligible to apply, provided they meet specific criteria such as not being in arrears with social security and health insurance contributions, not being in a state of bankruptcy or liquidation, and not having received ZUS co-financing within the past three years.<br><br>The level of co-financing varies depending on the type of enterprise. The application period runs from July 15 to August 16, 2019. Eligible investments include purchasing and installing safety guards, protective devices, signaling systems, soundproofing, air purification systems, ventilation systems, equipment for work at height safety, and devices to reduce musculoskeletal strain. Also, the purchase of personal protective equipment is eligible for companies with up to 49 employees.<br><br>Preparing the application requires careful attention to detail, as it undergoes formal and merit-based assessment based on criteria outlined in the competition regulations. Ensuring the documentation is complete and achieves a favorable assessment is crucial for securing funding. Seeking assistance from specialists in labor and occupational health and safety is recommended to enhance the application's quality and increase the chances of approval.</p>

The possibility of submitting such a declaration by a proxy is explicitly excluded.<br><br>At the same time, Article 56d was introduced to the Fiscal Penal Code, providing for fiscal criminal liability for misrepresentation (concealment of the truth) in the payer's declaration (fine and imprisonment).<br><br>Therefore, in principle, criminal liability for providing false data in these declarations rests with the members of the company's management board.<br><br>If you are interested in verifying the correctness of the procedures used in your company concerning withholding tax, please contact us.<br><br>Since July 1, 2019, Polish withholding tax regulations stipulate that payments exceeding PLN 2 million to a single entity are subject to standard tax collection, negating the use of double taxation treaties, exemptions, or special rates, unless the payer submits a formal statement. This statement confirms the possession of requisite documentation and the absence of knowledge suggesting ineligibility for treaty benefits or exemptions. Crucially, only the head of the unit or members of the management board can sign this declaration, excluding proxies.<br><br>Moreover, the Fiscal Penal Code now imposes criminal liability, including fines and imprisonment, for misrepresentation in this statement, primarily holding company management board members accountable. This underscores the importance of rigorous due diligence and accurate reporting. Companies are encouraged to review their withholding tax procedures to ensure compliance and avoid potential penalties. Expert assistance is available to assess and rectify any procedural deficiencies.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full760" style="display:none;">Since 2019, businesses in Poland have been required to implement an internal procedure regarding compliance with the obligation to report tax schemes, known as the internal MDR procedure. This obligation applies to legal entities and organizational units without legal personality acting as promoters, employing promoters, or effectively paying them, whose revenues or costs exceeded PLN 8,000,000 in the previous financial year.<br><br>Two conditions must be met cumulatively: the entity must be a promoter (or employ/pay one), and their revenue/costs must exceed the specified threshold. A promoter is defined as someone who advises clients, develops, offers, makes available, or implements tax arrangements. An arrangement is an action or set of actions that affect a taxpayer's tax obligations. Therefore, if a company develops or implements any tax arrangement and its revenue/costs exceed PLN 8 million, it must have an internal MDR procedure.<br><br>Failure to implement this procedure can result in a fine of up to PLN 2,000,000, or up to PLN 10,000,000 if a tax crime related to MDR obligations is confirmed by a final court verdict.</p>

      <h2>Non-deductible VAT on passenger cars from 1 January 2019.</h2>
      <p class="date">22.05.2019</p>
      <hr/>

      <p class="full-content" id="full762" style="display:none;">There are two main options for entrepreneurs acquiring a car for business use: purchasing for cash or leasing.<br><br>When purchasing for cash, the tax-deductible depreciation is capped based on a vehicle value of 150,000 PLN (225,000 PLN for electric vehicles). The vehicle's value includes the purchase price plus non-deductible VAT. Therefore, if only 50% of VAT is deductible, the remaining portion increases the car's value and subsequently affects deductible depreciation, remaining within the 150,000 PLN limit.<br><br>Alternatively, leasing allows for tax-deductible lease payments proportional to the 150,000 PLN limit compared to the car's value. Crucially, non-deductible VAT on lease payments, according to CIT and PIT laws, can be included as a tax-deductible expense without being subject to the 150,000 PLN limit, as it doesn't increase the asset's value. This interpretation, based on the clear wording of the CIT act, seemingly permits deducting the unrecovered VAT regardless of the 150,000 PLN threshold in leasing scenarios. Official clarification from the Ministry is anticipated to confirm this position in forthcoming tax explanations regarding business car usage.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full768" style="display:none;">Each of these individuals uses a flat tax rate, paying a 19% income tax. Additionally, they pay minimum lump-sum social security contributions. According to a Ministry representative, cases of individuals working solely for one contractor often represent "sham" entrepreneurship: "They work for one company and issue one invoice per month. Moreover, they often have a non-compete clause. I don't know any real entrepreneurs who would agree to a non-compete clause."<br><br>The Ministry aims to combat individuals who register sole proprietorships and pay lower taxes, which it considers unfair to those paying taxes and contributions on employment contracts while performing the same tasks as those operating as businesses. The proposed solution is the "entrepreneur test," which would determine who is a genuine entrepreneur. However, details of the test's design and the timeline for its implementation remain undisclosed.<br><br>This plan represents a tool in the ongoing struggle between taxpayers and the tax authorities. The authorities have repeatedly referenced the definition of economic activity to argue that certain sole proprietors do not meet the criteria to be considered entrepreneurs and should be taxed as employees under the progressive tax scale. Currently, such disputes often end up in administrative courts. The planned tool would enable tax authorities to determine much earlier how an individual's income should be taxed, obviously benefiting the state budget.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full772" style="display:none;">Due to inaccuracies in many online resources, the following points are clarified:<br><br>1.  Employers can choose to maintain employee records in either paper or electronic form.<br>2.  Employers can switch between these formats at any time.<br>3.  The adaptation period primarily concerns the basic ABC document classifications, with additions of category D and minor adjustments to the register, allowing 12 months for implementation, not for the introduction of electronic records entirely. Records can continue to be maintained as before, requiring only reordering according to the new register and addition of the "D" category.<br>4.  Record retention periods: 50 years for employees hired before January 1, 1999, and those with specific data (e.g., miners); 10 years for employees hired from January 1, 2019, or between 1999-2018, provided a ZUS OSW and RIA report are filed. Failure to file extends the retention to 50 years. The ZUS OSW statement can be submitted at any time but can only be withdrawn before the first ZUS RIA report is filed. Once the first RIA report is filed, all subsequent reports must be completed.<br>5.  The statement regarding the certificate of employment can take two forms: an additional point in the certificate or additional information stating the record retention period, the employee's right to collect the documentation by the end of the month following the retention period, and that the documentation will be destroyed if not collected.<br>6.  If an employer chooses to change the format of employee records, they must inform employees about the change and their right to collect their previous documentation within 30 days.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full774" style="display:none;">Specifically, it should be a document in the form of an electronic file with the JPK_SF logical structure, confirmed by a secure electronic signature.<br><br>The new requirements were introduced into the Accounting Act in October 2018. However, most companies are facing the new obligation only now, as the deadline for closing the accounting books for 2018 approaches.<br><br>The annual financial statement of entities maintaining full accounting records is prepared within 3 months from the balance sheet date – therefore, entities whose fiscal year coincides with the calendar year have time until March 31, 2019, to prepare it.<br><br>The most important change that entrepreneurs will encounter is sending the financial statement to the National Court Register (KRS) in electronic form according to the imposed logical file structure (JPK_SF). Additionally, electronic financial statements must be signed with a secure electronic signature by both the person preparing the financial statement and all persons indicated in the KRS as authorized to represent the entity. In the case of financial statements audited by a statutory auditor, they are also obliged to sign it electronically.<br><br>E-Reports – consequences of new requirements<br><br>In the first year, entrepreneurs will certainly face considerable difficulties:<br><br>familiarizing themselves with new tools, obtaining an electronic signature by all members of the management board, and preparing the financial statement in a new formula, while often copying templates from previous years until now.<br><br>In a situation where accounting is conducted without the support of an external accounting office, it may be an additional logistical and organizational challenge in a rather fast-paced business life.<br><br>However, it should be taken into account that new technical solutions will allow for easier monitoring of the financial results of business partners in the future, and thus improve the security of economic transactions. Good quality information will be easily accessible to every entrepreneur. Therefore, it should be assumed that awareness in the field of proper accounting and care for ensuring a reliable image will also improve.<br><br>For preparing a financial statement in violation of the guidelines of the Accounting Act, the regulations provide for the threat of a fine or imprisonment of up to two years or both penalties jointly. Therefore, every effort should be made to update systems, supplement knowledge and fulfill new requirements.<br><br>If you would like to learn more about the issues discussed, please contact us.<br><br>Contact<br><br>E-Reports, requirements, changes<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The Polish Accounting Act was amended in October 2018, mandating electronic financial statement submissions to the National Court Register (KRS) in JPK_SF format. Companies operating on a calendar-year fiscal cycle must comply by March 31, 2019. These e-statements require secure electronic signatures from both the preparer and all KRS-registered representatives, including auditors if applicable. This new system presents initial challenges, including familiarization with new tools, obtaining digital signatures for all board members, and adapting to the new reporting format. While posing logistical hurdles, particularly for businesses without external accounting support, the shift promises enhanced financial transparency, facilitating improved monitoring of business partners and bolstering economic security. Non-compliance can lead to fines or imprisonment, emphasizing the need for businesses to update systems, expand knowledge, and fulfill these updated requirements. The new solutions enable easier monitoring of financial results of business partners and therefore improving security.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full775" style="display:none;">**Scope of Regulations in 2018 and 2019**<br><br>The amending law came into effect on January 1, 2019, and generally applies from that date. However, due to the reporting obligations in income taxes being fulfilled after the tax year ends, transitional provisions specify the application date, even if it coincides with the law's effective date. Reporting obligations, although fulfilled post-tax year, are a consequence of the prior year's tax obligation. References to applying the law to income from a specific date mean applying it to determine the tax liability for that tax year and the subsequent reporting obligations.<br><br>Article 44(1) of the amending law doesn't abolish prior obligations but addresses intertemporal issues related to implementing changes. For corporate income taxpayers with non-calendar tax years that began before January 1, 2019, and end after December 31, 2018, the previous regulations apply until the end of their tax year. The new regulations apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2018, reflecting the constitutional principle against retroactive law.<br><br>The fact that repealed regulations are no longer in effect when reporting for the previous year is irrelevant; the crucial factor is the period the obligation pertains to. For transfer pricing obligations for 2018, the regulations in effect that year generally apply.<br><br>However, Article 44(2) allows opting for the new regulations for all controlled transactions in 2018, precluding simultaneous application of both sets of rules. The TP-R form doesn't apply to 2018, instead, the CIT/TP or PIT/TP form is required.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full776" style="display:none;">The regulations effective from January 1, 2019, raise numerous doubts and questions regarding their interpretation and proper inclusion in costs, lacking clear answers. The changes primarily concern three key areas: the limit for including the cost of purchasing a passenger car in income tax expenses, restrictions on including operating expenses for company cars used for both business and private purposes, and a limit for private cars not listed in the fixed asset register.<br><br>The limit for deducting passenger car acquisition costs is now capped at 225,000 PLN for electric vehicles and 150,000 PLN for other cars, replacing the previous 20,000 EUR limit. This limit applies to depreciation and operational leasing installments; however, agreements before January 1, 2019, remain under the old rules unless amended. Only the capital part of the leasing agreement is subject to the limit, while the interest portion is considered an operating expense.<br><br>Regarding company cars used for both business and private purposes, only 75% of operating expenses (fuel, repairs, highway tolls, parking fees) can be included in income tax expenses. If a car is used solely for business, 100% can be included with a vehicle mileage log, but inaccuracies can result in the 75% limit being applied retroactively. For private cars used for business, a flat 20% of operating expenses can be included as income tax expenses, replacing the mileage allowance, without the need for a vehicle mileage log.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full779" style="display:none;">When calculating income from renting out a fully furnished apartment with a tenant, individuals not running a business can choose between general tax rules (18%, 32% rates on income minus costs) or a flat-rate tax on recorded income (8.5% up to 100,000 PLN, 12.5% on the excess). Most investors opt for the flat rate due to its simplicity.<br><br>Since January 1, 2019, further simplifications have been introduced. Taxpayers are no longer required to submit a notification of choosing the flat-rate taxation. Making the first flat-rate payment in a tax year is considered equivalent to choosing this taxation method. If the first income is received in December, filing the tax return by the deadline suffices.<br><br>For properties co-owned by spouses, income is split proportionally unless they declare that one spouse will handle the full taxation. This declaration must be submitted to the tax office by the 20th of the month following the month when the first income was received, or by the end of the year if the income arrived in December. Only one spouse needs to sign this declaration.<br><br>Taxpayers are exempt from maintaining income records, instead proving income based on payment confirmations. The tax return deadline is between February 15th and the end of February of the following year, concerning incomes received after 2019.<br><br>Knowing these regulations, investors can enjoy the benefits of their profitable real estate investment.</p>

      <h2>IFRS 16 - Leases - a new deal, new rules</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full780" style="display:none;">IFRS 16 is a significant shift, not just a terminology update, potentially requiring renegotiation of existing agreements and impacting IT systems and financial planning KPIs. While effective since January 1, 2019, some entities are only now assessing its scale.<br><br>IFRS 16 applies to entities under IFRS standards, excluding specific asset types like biological assets and intellectual property licenses, agreements below $5,000, and those lasting 12 months or less. However, determining contract value and duration necessitates understanding new IFRS 16 definitions.<br><br>The definition of a lease is similar to IAS 17 but shifts from "risks and rewards" to guidelines considering benefits from the asset and its independence from other assets. This can reclassify agreements as leases and separate leasing and operational components. Applying IFRS 15 principles helps allocate contract prices. However, lessees can opt not to separate operational elements. Lease terms include optional periods if extension is likely.<br><br>Preparing for IFRS 16 involves understanding its impact on financial statements, particularly the balance sheet, which will reflect all leases as assets and liabilities. This can inflate balance sheet totals, increase EBITDA, raise debt ratios, and reduce asset profitability, possibly necessitating renegotiation of financing agreements with "frozen GAAP" clauses. Simulation and scenario planning are recommended. More detailed lease data management might require dedicated software beyond Excel.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full782" style="display:none;">Despite numerous commercial agreements, clients often face issues like unfinished projects, staff shortages, and unforeseen events. Taxpayers are legally obligated to make mandatory monetary payments without prompting from the tax office. If a company's financial analysis suggests it cannot fulfill this obligation, the tax authority, under Article 67a of the Tax Ordinance, can postpone tax payment deadlines or allow payment in installments. They can also postpone or spread the payment of tax arrears with interest or even completely or partially forgive tax arrears, late payment interest, or extension fees upon the taxpayer's request, provided it doesn't constitute public aid or is de minimis aid.<br><br>Public aid can be granted to repair damage from natural disasters or other extraordinary events, prevent economic disturbances, support national entrepreneurs in European initiatives, and promote culture, heritage, science, and education. Crucially, if a business knows before the tax payment deadline that it lacks funds, it can request payment in installments without waiting for arrears. The taxpayer must provide arguments demonstrating a significant public or private interest justifying the relief and demonstrate the ability to meet the revised payment schedule. The tax authority then issues a decision deferring payment or allowing installments, including an extension fee. Compliance with the agreed payment schedule is crucial; failure to do so voids the decision, reverting to the original payment deadline. Although the required documentation and deadlines can be daunting, this approach offers a crucial lifeline for businesses.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full784" style="display:none;">The Constitutional Tribunal ruled that while the law in question does not violate Article 2 of the Constitution, which states that the Republic of Poland is a democratic state governed by the rule of law and realizing the principles of social justice, it is inconsistent with Article 7 of the Constitution. Article 7 states that public authorities operate on the basis and within the limits of the law.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>The Polish Constitutional Tribunal issued a ruling (Kp 1/18) declaring a specific law unconstitutional based on Article 7 of the Polish Constitution. The Tribunal found that the law's provisions violated the principle that public authorities must operate within the boundaries of the law. Although the law did not contravene Article 2 concerning the democratic rule of law and social justice, the breach of Article 7 rendered it invalid. The case concerns the elimination of the contribution limit to the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS). The ruling is significant due to its impact on the functioning of public authorities and their adherence to constitutional principles.</p>

      <h2>Energy sector still faces numerous uncertainties. Transition to renewable sources hampered by fees and infrastructure</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full802" style="display:none;">The energy sector faces significant uncertainties, with the transition to renewable sources hindered by fees and infrastructure limitations. While Europe aims to combat climate change and energy dependence through clean energy, the Czech Republic struggles with structural and regulatory hurdles. Massive investments, inadequate infrastructure, and a pricing structure unsuited for decentralized renewable production pose challenges.<br><br>Despite the Czech Republic's commitment to the EU's Fit for 55 plan, achieving the ambitious 2030 decarbonization and renewable energy targets is unlikely. Emissions are projected to decrease by around 45%, with renewables reaching approximately 25% of final energy consumption, falling short of the EU's goals.<br><br>While the Czech Republic has reduced reliance on solid fossil fuels, shifting towards renewables and nuclear energy, coal still constitutes a significant portion of its electricity generation compared to the EU average. Photovoltaics are experiencing a boom, but the lack of advanced storage infrastructure strains grid stability. Diversifying energy production technologies and infrastructure for energy storage is crucial.<br><br>The Czech Republic has potential in combined solar and wind energy due to complementary seasonal production. However, an undersized distribution network restricts new source connections, and unfavorable energy-sharing legislation with higher distribution fees discourages local consumption and community energy initiatives. The current electricity pricing structure, designed for centralized production, needs a review to accommodate thousands of small producers and reflect the variability of new sources.<br><br>Globally, geopolitical events have catalyzed a focus on energy independence, driving investments in decentralized renewable solutions. Strengthening domestic renewable production is key to reducing reliance on external suppliers, necessitating investments in modernizing transmission and distribution systems.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full803" style="display:none;">Digital processes and digital money are strengthening the relationship between clients and financial institutions. New regulations in the UK's financial sector are enhancing consumer protection, requiring financial service providers to adapt product offerings and customer care standards. This involves greater consumer input into product design and leveraging vast amounts of data, a technological revolution that refines risk assessment.<br><br>In the Czech Republic, financial institutions are also increasingly adopting technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is crucial for competitiveness, improving customer experience, and risk management. Its applications include risk assessment, portfolio optimization, fraud detection, process automation, and document management. AI also acts as an employee assistant, minimizing errors and boosting productivity.<br><br>Another trend is the anticipated decrease in interest rates, which may lead to more loans and economic growth. However, this could also reduce net interest margins, a significant revenue source for Czech banks. Despite this, Czech banks generally enjoy high public trust, further bolstered by EU directives on consumer credit agreements, including new online products. The emergence of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) also presents new opportunities, offering the stability of traditional currencies while potentially serving as a funding source for retail banking.<br><br>Digital processes and digital money are enhancing the client-financial institution relationship through increased consumer protection and data utilization. Financial institutions are increasingly adopting AI for improved competitiveness, customer experience, and risk management. While falling interest rates may impact net margins, public trust in Czech banks remains high, supported by evolving regulations and the potential of central bank digital currencies. These technological and regulatory shifts are reshaping the financial landscape, emphasizing transparency, efficiency, and a stronger client focus.</p>

      <h2>Companies in 2025 face further tax changes, construction will be no exception</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full805" style="display:none;">Companies will face further tax changes in 2025, with the construction industry not being an exception.<br><br>The start of 2025 brought several tax changes impacting businesses in the Czech Republic, including amendments to VAT law and a restriction of tax security from financial guarantees to bank guarantees. Further key tax changes are set to take effect throughout the year, significantly affecting the construction sector and the real estate market.<br><br>From January 1, 2025, VAT law was modified concerning mandatory registration. If a business's annual turnover exceeds two million CZK but not 2,536,500 CZK, they become VAT payers from January 1 of the following year, based on the full calendar year's turnover, not any consecutive 12 months. Exceeding 2,536,500 CZK during the year makes them a VAT payer from the next day. This may cause confusion and administrative complications, with the actual impact yet to be seen.<br><br>Another administrative change is the narrowing of tax security forms from financial guarantees to only bank guarantees, aimed at preventing tax evasion. Businesses will need to switch to bank guarantees, potentially increasing administrative costs.<br><br>A new rule effective May 1, 2025, will affect financial institutions by changing how savings periods are calculated when switching long-term investment product providers. This aims to offer investors more flexibility and encourage competition, but requires financial institutions to thoroughly inform clients and adapt their systems.<br><br>The construction industry and real estate market will see significant tax changes from July. Property sales will be taxed only on the first sale within two years of occupancy or significant alteration; subsequent sales will be tax-exempt. VAT rates for construction and assembly work on completed residential or social housing will change if the construction no longer meets the criteria for these types, ensuring new construction isn't disadvantaged compared to reconstructed buildings not qualifying for reduced VAT. The definition of a residential building for social housing will also be updated, expanding the application of reduced VAT rates for residential building construction.<br><br>These changes may significantly influence real estate investors and developer strategies. Increased VAT on renovations and conversions could shift investor decisions towards new construction. The construction sector has already faced changes at the year's start, including new taxation rules for forest land and adjusted tax calculations. Municipalities can also now modify tax coefficients by property type or location, potentially increasing business tax liabilities.</p>

      <h2>Home-office has transformed the job market. Will it remain common practice?</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full806" style="display:none;">The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally reshaped the labor market, transforming home-office work from a niche practice into a significant aspect of employment. Before the pandemic, Czech Republic had a low adoption rate of remote work, with only 10% of employees working from home at least occasionally, compared to the EU average of 16%. This dramatically shifted during the pandemic, leading to a sustained increase in remote work.<br><br>Experts indicate that this trend is largely characterized by hybrid models, where employees work from home for less than half of the week. The most significant increase is seen in the 25-44 age group, with a substantial rise in remote work adoption. Preferences show that a majority of both men and women wish to work from home a few days a week. Company size is less influential than the industry; sectors like information technology, finance, real estate, and insurance have seen the highest adoption of home-office arrangements. Studies suggest that hybrid work often boosts productivity, with 77% of managers reporting increased support for remote work post-pandemic.<br><br>The advantages of home-office include flexibility, better work-life balance, and potentially less office-related distraction. However, challenges like isolation, communication difficulties, and blurred work-life boundaries exist. Long-term productivity can decline without clear structure and employee discipline. Successful implementation requires clear communication of expectations, effective performance measurement, and employee motivation.<br><br>The rise of home-office also presents opportunities for greater female labor force participation, particularly for mothers of young children, and for attracting talent from further distances. For the future, while many employees desire continued remote work options, companies must strategically assess its suitability for their specific work and ensure it doesn't hinder efficiency. Clear communication, defined expectations, and provision of necessary tools and support are crucial for successful hybrid models. The overall approach to home-office will likely vary among employers, with some mandating office returns while others embrace more flexible arrangements, but a structured approach to measuring results is key.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full807" style="display:none;">The engineering group ANACOT CAPITAL, led by businessman Pavel Drobil, has acquired an 85% stake in Laugo Arms Czechoslovakia, a manufacturer of high-end sports and defense pistols.

Laugo Arms is renowned for its innovative design and precision engineering, particularly its flagship Alien pistol, which features a revolutionary gas-operated bolt braking system and a low barrel position, making it ideal for sport shooting. The pistol has achieved international commercial success, winning awards like the main prize at the SHOT Show in Las Vegas.<br><br>Laugo Arms has significant growth potential and international expansion ambitions that require substantial investment. The new ownership is committed to driving the company forward through capital investment and leveraging their existing manufacturing capabilities and international network. Pavel Drobil highlighted the potential for market growth and new development opportunities in collaboration with the former owner. Petr Kymlička of MaeG Investment SICAV emphasized utilizing shared manufacturing capacities and extensive business contacts for distribution and partnerships. The new owners also plan to introduce an enhanced version of the Alien pistol. Laugo Arms currently sells approximately 3,500 hand-produced Alien pistols annually, with over 40% of its revenue generated in the USA. The company, established in 2017, reported €8.2 million in revenue and €2.3 million in EBITDA in 2022, with revenues expected to exceed €12 million in the following year. ANACOT CAPITAL focuses on acquiring and developing export-oriented industrial companies, with Pavel Drobil as its sole shareholder.

      <p class="full-content" id="full809" style="display:none;">Moore Czech Republic, along with its parent network Moore Global, has joined the global Mindful Business Charter initiative to reduce workplace stress and promote employee mental well-being. This commitment stems from the recognition that prolonged occupational stress negatively impacts mental and physical health, relationships, and can lead to absenteeism. Recent research indicates that a significant portion of Czechs, particularly Generation Z, experience stress that interferes with their daily lives and work, with many reporting absences due to excessive stress.<br><br>As a new member of the Mindful Business Charter, Moore Czech Republic pledges to implement measures that support employee well-being, such as efficient meeting management, reducing unnecessary emails, and respecting downtime. The company already practices these principles and sees participation as a demonstration of their commitment to a healthier work environment. They aim to inspire and share experiences with other companies to foster positive change. The charter's framework emphasizes openness, respect, communication, and considerate delegation, all crucial for combating stress-related issues like fatigue and burnout. Moore Czech Republic actively organizes workshops, like "How to Stay Effective and Not Go Crazy," offering practical stress-management tips. They also engage in initiatives like the "Moore to the Moon" challenge, encouraging physical activity, and local "WALKING CHALLENGE 10K" events, linking employee health with charitable contributions. These efforts underscore their dedication to achieving results while ensuring employee well-being.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full813" style="display:none;">The Czech Republic is implementing the EU's NIS2 directive with a new cybersecurity law, aiming to bolster businesses and public institutions against cyberattacks. Despite its significant impact on thousands of companies across various sectors, awareness of NIS2 remains very low. A survey by Moore Czech Republic revealed that nearly three-quarters of respondents had not heard of the directive. Of those who had, many had only partial knowledge.<br><br>The new law, expected to enter force next year, will extend cybersecurity obligations to approximately 10,000 companies, including energy providers, airlines, hospitals, and water suppliers. Currently, only a quarter of organizations have a comprehensive implementation plan, with many lacking any roadmap at all. Key barriers to implementation include a lack of funds and expertise, as well as the complexity of legislative requirements. While those aware of NIS2 perceive it positively as an opportunity to enhance customer trust and security, many essential measures like incident response plans are still uncommon.<br><br>NIS2 aims to strengthen the security of networks and information systems, requiring regulated service providers to report to the National Cyber and Information Security Agency, implement security measures, and report cyber incidents. Many companies have already adopted some basic security practices like employee training and data backups, but more advanced measures are less widespread. The directive introduces significant regulatory changes for a broad range of private and public entities.</p>

      <h2>Hospitality: Check-in to a Year of Growth and Digital Change. The Biggest Problem in the Czech Republic is Short Tourist Stays</h2>

      <p class="full-content" id="full820" style="display:none;">The hospitality sector is experiencing a year of growth and digital transformation, moving beyond pandemic impacts with many hotel groups achieving record occupancy and profitability. This year focuses on technological innovation, particularly advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, shifting from basic chatbots to sophisticated solutions for revenue management, security, and energy control. The global hospitality AI market is projected to reach $8.12 billion by 2033.<br><br>The trend of "bleisure" (business + leisure) travel is growing, with global business travel spending expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2024, contributing to longer stays and increased spending. Investor interest in hotels remains strong due to their dynamic pricing and occupancy trends, distinguishing them from other commercial properties. Major hotel chains are pursuing expansion in emerging regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and popular European destinations.<br><br>However, the sector faces challenges including geopolitical risks, economic slowdowns, rising operational costs, and a persistent shortage of skilled labor. In the Czech Republic, while the sector saw a rebound in 2023, with over 22 million tourists, the primary issue remains the short duration of tourist stays. This is partly due to a shift towards visitors from neighboring countries and a lack of long-stay tourists from regions like Asia. Prague, in particular, is affected by limited intercontinental air connectivity. Adapting to digitalization, sustainability, personalized services, and effective state promotion are crucial for the Czech hospitality industry to attract longer-staying international visitors.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full821" style="display:none;">Despite labor shortages, Czechs over 55 believe age is a barrier to finding work. A survey by MOORE Czech Republic reveals that 85.2% of Czechs over 55 feel age is a major obstacle to employment, with nearly half strongly agreeing. Both the 55-59 and 60-65 age groups share this sentiment. Marcela Hrdá from MOORE Czech Republic points out that while the Czech labor market is overheated, companies struggle to attract older workers, who often possess valuable skills, language abilities, and experience.<br><br>Hrdá warns that the low unemployment rate isn't necessarily positive for the Czech economy, hindering recovery and competitiveness. She urges companies to create part-time opportunities and support environments to retain employees over 55. The survey also shows that nearly 70% perceive employer concerns about older employees keeping up with technology, while 64% believe companies simply prefer younger workers. Over half believe that firms are prejudiced against the productivity and motivation of older workers.<br><br>Hrdá suggests that companies need to overcome these biases and undergo a mental transformation in their HR policies. Flexibility is a key factor for older employees, but nearly 60% perceive a lack of it from employers. Respondents suggested that employers would welcome flexible working hours, technology training, and health support. 46.5% think more awareness about the benefits of older workers would help, and nearly a third want more information about suitable job opportunities. Many older employees feel they could contribute more to their current employers. The survey was conducted by MOORE Czech Republic in April 2024 on a sample of 600 employed respondents over 55.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full822" style="display:none;">Automotive suppliers face complex investment decisions as major car manufacturers signal that electric vehicles (EVs) aren't the only future path. Stagnating EV sales prompt a more pragmatic approach, with traditional combustion engines and "e-fuels" retaining their role. While EV sales are expected to rise globally, growth varies across markets, with Europe expected to stagnate, US sales potentially hindered by political factors, and China's growth slowing. Toyota's chairman predicts EVs will never exceed 30% of global sales, favoring alternative fuels like hydrogen.<br><br>This uncertainty challenges suppliers, especially those in Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the supply chain. Tier 1 suppliers grapple with allocating R&D budgets across different powertrains, while Tier 2 suppliers, producing specialized components, face difficult transitions. Shifting from combustion engine parts to EV components demands time and investment, a challenge for smaller, often family-owned businesses reliant on internal funding and bank loans. The industry's low margins and pressure from manufacturers to lower costs further complicate matters.<br><br>This situation will likely lead to consolidation among traditional suppliers, attracting private investment and fostering collaboration within the supply chain. The uncertainty could also spur a new ecosystem with closer ties between manufacturers and suppliers, potentially enabling companies to manage both combustion engine and EV technologies. Czech suppliers also face these challenges, adapting to new trends while navigating labor shortages and cost pressures.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full823" style="display:none;">Moore Global's analysis highlights key trends in industrial manufacturing and distribution for 2024, emphasizing the transformative power of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics. AI offers opportunities for optimized production and data-driven decision-making, but requires careful management of trust in digital technologies. The trend of manufacturing repatriation is also gaining momentum, driven by supply chain vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic and geopolitical instability. Companies are shifting away from "just-in-time" models towards more resilient industrial ecosystems.<br><br>AI's impact extends to predicting customer behavior, forecasting trends, and modeling strategic scenarios. However, realizing AI's benefits requires investment in employee skills and real-time data accessibility across departments. While AI simplifies key performance indicators and enhances decision-making through data visualization tools, managers must be cautious about blind trust, ensuring data accuracy and validation.<br><br>Implementing these technologies demands resources, time, and substantial investment, complicated by high borrowing costs and economic uncertainty. Efficient financial management is crucial, particularly for companies reliant on complex supply chains disrupted by recent global events. Geopolitical instability exacerbates these challenges, prompting a shift away from the traditional "just-in-time" model. Manufacturing repatriation is accelerating, with increased investment in domestic production in the US and Europe, supported by government incentives. Businesses are prioritizing proximity to consumers, driving new factory openings in these regions, which is enhancing countries' economic independence.</p>

A Moore Global analysis indicates that these digital tools offer potential for increased efficiency, higher margins, and fewer customer complaints, but also pose risks if not properly understood and mitigated.<br><br>The financial industry has transformed significantly in the last 25 years due to technology, from smartphone apps to blockchain, enabling customers to access a wider range of financial products and make decisions faster. AI, initially researched in the 1950s, saw slow adoption until major technological advancements in Silicon Valley spurred the "fintech" boom. Customer demand for internet banking drove changes in service distribution, data protection, and fraud prevention. Financial firms sought to improve customer service, boost profit margins, and attract investors.<br><br>AI enhances accuracy and efficiency, enabling personalized product recommendations, fraud detection through transaction analysis and behavioral biometrics, risk assessment, and climate change modeling for insurance. However, reliance on data requires accuracy, and regulators are struggling to keep pace. The EU's AI Act aims to classify technologies by risk and impose varying levels of restrictions.<br><br>While regulations are necessary, they risk stifling innovation. The next phase of technological revolution in financial services may only last five years, putting immense pressure on developers, investors, and regulators. Despite regulation concerns, AI offers unprecedented benefits to the financial sector, including increased efficiency, improved customer protection, product innovation, and better decision-making, such as real-time fraud detection, personalized services, and automated tasks.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full825" style="display:none;">Community energy can transform the Czech Republic, with the state supporting cities and municipalities in their energy transition. The recent amendment to the Energy Act, Lex OZE II, paves the way for community energy development. A crucial initial step is creating a local energy concept, for which significant subsidies are available through the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) from the National Recovery Plan. Municipalities can apply online until June 30, 2025.<br><br>Developing a local energy concept helps municipalities understand their energy balance, identify inefficiencies, and target energy measures effectively. Tomáš Křapáček from Moore Advisory CZ emphasizes the need for strategic energy planning, advising municipalities to prioritize development activities based on return on investment. He cautions against solely focusing on solar panels, advocating for comprehensive energy solutions. Subsidies cover 85-95% of eligible costs.<br><br>These concepts allow detailed assessment, inventory of consumption points, and creation of a complete energy balance, encompassing municipal property, the business sector, and households. This fosters collaboration and is a stepping stone to community energy, enabling calculation of energy and economic impacts of shared energy flows. Lex OZE II facilitates energy sharing among public sector entities, households, and businesses. Decentralized energy, complementing centralized systems, allows efficient local consumption. Local energy concepts also propose energy solutions, estimate investments, and evaluate returns, enabling data-driven decisions and promoting renewable energy use.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full827" style="display:none;">In 2024, Czech Republic faces significant tax changes. Corporate income tax rises from 19% to 21%, increasing firms' tax burden by about 10%, potentially impacting investments and competitiveness. Tax deductibility for non-cash employee benefits is restricted, adding administrative burden and reducing their appeal. A limit of 2 million CZK is set for car depreciation, with exceptions for zero-emission vehicles. Gifting of silent wine is now non-deductible, and reporting requirements for foreign income are narrowed.<br><br>For individuals, the spousal tax credit is limited to those with children under three, and the tax credit for kindergarten placement is eliminated, raising taxes for families with young children. The student tax credit is also scrapped. The threshold for the 23% personal income tax rate is lowered, affecting higher-income earners. Non-financial benefits face a limit of half the average wage, increasing the tax burden for employees. Planned restrictions on agreements for work performed (DPP) are delayed to July 2024 and under review.<br><br>Capital gains from the sale of shares and securities will be limited from 2025. Social security and health insurance contributions for the self-employed will increase.<br><br>The VAT rate for food decreases from 15% to 12%, though retailers are considering price hikes. Two reduced VAT rates merge into a single rate of 12%. Books are now VAT-exempt, and VAT deductions for car purchases are capped.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full830" style="display:none;">A study by Moore Advisory CZ for the Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs highlights the need for improved fire safety in residential social care facilities like nursing homes. The analysis, comparing the Czech Republic to Germany, Austria, Poland, and New Zealand, found that foreign facilities emphasize more frequent fire safety training and evacuation drills for staff.<br><br>A survey of 153 Czech facilities revealed shortcomings. Of those providing services in multi-story buildings, nearly half lack evacuation-compliant elevators, posing a significant risk during a fire. While most facilities have multiple escape routes and fire detection systems, fewer have evacuation elevators or fire alarms connected to fire stations. Facilities with over 50 beds have until December 2024 to install electronic fire signaling systems. Worryingly, some reported having only one escape route.<br><br>The report indicates that financial constraints hinder fire safety improvements, as most facilities are publicly funded and lack investment budgets, further strained by rising energy costs. The analysis underscores the importance of proactive fire safety measures to prevent tragedies in these vulnerable settings.</p>

      <h2>First Observations on the Whistleblower Protection Act Implementation: Surprised Schools and Hesitant Small Businesses</h2>
      <p class="date">19.09.2023</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary833">First Observations on the Implementation of the Whistleblower Protection Act: Caught-Off-Guard Schools and Hesitant Small Businesses<br><br>The new Whistleblower Protection Act came into effect on August 1,</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full833" style="display:none;">First Observations on the Implementation of the Whistleblower Protection Act: Caught-Off-Guard Schools and Hesitant Small Businesses<br><br>The new Whistleblower Protection Act came into effect on August 1, 2023, introducing significant changes for various entities in the Czech Republic. Whistleblowers are now expected to play a crucial role in reporting illegal activities within organizations. Early observations suggest that the law has surprised many, including schools that had to implement new requirements during their summer break. Experts emphasize the necessity of building trust in the reporting system among employees and fostering a change in corporate culture.<br><br>The law mandates that employers with at least fifty employees, municipalities with over 10,000 inhabitants, public procurement entities, certain public authorities, and specific financial sector entities must establish an internal reporting system. However, companies with 50 to 249 employees have an extended deadline until December 15, 2023, for implementation. Failure to comply can result in penalties of up to one million Czech crowns for severe violations, such as not establishing a system or allowing retaliation against whistleblowers. False reporting can incur fines of up to 50,000 Czech crowns.<br><br>A key aspect of the law is the employer's obligation to operate an internal reporting system to protect whistleblowers. The credibility of this system hinges on the trustworthiness of the designated investigator, who must act independently and impartially, informing whistleblowers of the outcome within legal deadlines. Assigning this role to existing employees carries a risk of distrust, as employees might fear retaliation from colleagues.<br><br>For the system's success, it's crucial to move beyond mere formal compliance and cultivate a workplace atmosphere where employees feel safe to report. Top management's attitude and commitment are vital for genuine change towards greater transparency and fairness. While smaller companies have more time, they are urged to use it effectively for preparation, as many appear to be delaying implementation. Comprehensive solutions, including electronic tools, internal documentation, employee training, and ongoing support for the reporting process, are available to help organizations navigate these new requirements.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full834" style="display:none;">Blockchain is revolutionizing financial services, offering the potential for faster, cheaper payments and increased efficiency in banking and lending. Experts from Moore Global highlight that this technology can streamline operations, reduce counterparty risk, shorten settlement times, and enable real-time verification of financial documents. Decentralized ledgers facilitated by blockchain promise lower transaction fees and operating costs, bringing financial institutions closer to seamless interbank transactions.<br><br>However, significant challenges remain. Blockchain platforms currently exhibit low scalability compared to established systems like Visa, processing far fewer transactions per second. Fragmentation and a lack of standardized protocols hinder interoperability between different blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, the energy consumption associated with both blockchain and artificial intelligence is substantial, leading to high carbon dioxide emissions, particularly during AI model training.

      <h2>Unemployment is low, but the Czech economy is struggling. Why do we need foreigners and flexible working conditions?</h2>

      <p class="summary" id="summary835">Unemployment is low, but the Czech economy is struggling. Why do we need foreigners and flexible working conditions?<br><br>August 21, 2023<br><br>Unemployment in the Czech Republic has been falling for several m</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full835" style="display:none;">Unemployment is low, but the Czech economy is struggling. Why do we need foreigners and flexible working conditions?<br><br>August 21, 2023<br><br>Unemployment in the Czech Republic has been falling for several months, resulting in one of the lowest rates in the EU. However, this is not good news for the Czech economy, which is struggling. A situation where GDP is falling, unemployment is decreasing, and the number of job vacancies is rising hinders economic recovery and the competitiveness of Czech businesses. Radovan Hauk of Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the crucial need for the government to allow companies to hire skilled foreign workers, including Ukrainians, for long-term employment. Equally important is supporting part-time positions and creating an environment to retain employees over 55. Failure to address these issues will lead to significant future problems.<br><br>The demographic threat is substantial. The working population is declining due to an aging population, with around 40,000 fewer workers entering the market annually than those retiring. This deficit is projected to worsen in the next decade. The shortage of workers limits business growth and results in significant economic losses for the state. An estimated 280,000 to 300,000 vacancies represent a loss of approximately 350 to 375 billion CZK annually in GDP, and 95 to 105 billion CZK in potential tax revenue and social security contributions.<br><br>The tight labor market also drives excessive wage growth, though real wages have decreased due to high inflation. Certain sectors, like healthcare, IT, and manufacturing, face critical worker shortages. The government, in collaboration with social partners, must create more accessible and flexible programs for employing foreigners, focusing on attracting highly skilled individuals and also addressing the need for less-skilled labor in sectors where Czechs are less inclined to work. Competition from countries like Germany, with higher wages, makes attracting foreign talent even more challenging.<br><br>The Czech Republic's low unemployment rate, coupled with a struggling economy and a growing number of job vacancies, highlights a critical need for foreign labor and more flexible employment conditions. The aging Czech population means a declining workforce, with fewer young people entering the market than older workers retiring. This demographic trend is expected to exacerbate the labor shortage in the coming decade. Businesses are unable to reach their full production potential, leading to significant economic losses for the country, estimated at billions of CZK annually, in terms of lost GDP and tax revenue. The current wage growth, while seemingly high, is outpaced by inflation, leading to a real decrease in wages. Sectors such as healthcare, IT, and manufacturing are experiencing severe worker shortages. To maintain competitiveness and economic growth, the government must implement policies that facilitate the employment of foreign workers, both highly skilled and less-skilled. This includes reforming existing programs and actively attracting talent from abroad, especially competing with countries like Germany. Flexible working arrangements, such as part-time employment and retaining older workers, are also vital to addressing the labor deficit and ensuring the sustainability of the Czech economy.<br><br>Low unemployment is plaguing the Czech economy, which is struggling despite a declining jobless rate. This situation is exacerbated by a declining working-age population due to demographic shifts, with more people retiring than entering the workforce. Experts stress the urgent need for the government to facilitate the employment of foreign workers, both skilled and unskilled, to fill labor shortages and boost economic growth. The current economic landscape is characterized by businesses being unable to operate at full capacity due to a lack of staff, resulting in substantial economic losses for the country. Furthermore, real wages are falling due to high inflation. To counter these challenges and enhance competitiveness, the Czech Republic must adopt more flexible employment policies and attract foreign talent, facing competition from countries like Germany.</p>

Experts from the law firm Moore Legal CZ discussed this, also warning about potential pitfalls such as the limited reliability of generative text models and the need for heightened caution when handling sensitive data. Moore Legal CZ is already testing AI for tasks like information retrieval during due diligence and text editing.<br><br>Generative language models are primarily being used in law firms. Jan Kubica, a partner at Moore Legal CZ, stated that AI is viewed as another tool for lawyers, supplementing existing resources like legal commentary and case law. While AI's current role focuses on more peripheral tasks such as summarizing time sheets or preparing marketing reports, it presents an opportunity for law firms to rethink their internal workflows.<br><br>However, experts urge caution regarding AI's potential risks in legal practice. Kubica emphasizes understanding how data is processed by AI providers, particularly concerning the distinction between client and non-client data, and the possibility of AI generating false information.<br><br>Moore Legal CZ is testing AI systems for retrieving relevant text from internal databases for responses and for quickly finding relevant passages during due diligence. AI can also support legal writing by suggesting text simplification or generating counterarguments, always under the lawyer's supervision and control.<br><br>AI is subject to numerous national and European regulations, including professional conduct rules. Kubica believes the current robust EU regulation of AI is the right direction.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full837" style="display:none;">The Czech M&A market is recovering after a slowdown, with investors focusing on company resilience following the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Concerns about a deeper recession have eased, leading to renewed investor appetite fueled by accumulated capital and high inflation. Experts at Moore Czech Republic anticipate a market revival in the second half of 2023 and early 2024.<br><br>A crucial factor for investment is the resilience and sustainability of business models. Investors prioritize companies that have proven their ability to weather crises and those with diversified activities, avoiding those overly reliant on single areas.<br><br>The first half of 2023 saw 61 transactions, fewer than the previous year. However, receding recession fears are expected to increase transaction volume in the latter half of the year. Noteworthy deals include Westly Group's acquisition of Woltair, highlighting the attractiveness of clean energy companies, and Carlyle Group's acquisition of Meopta - Optika. The improved energy market situation has also allayed investor fears.<br><br>Currently, energy-intensive businesses, automotive suppliers, and firms dependent on foreign supply chains face challenges. While energy prices have stabilized, industries reliant on Asian supplies remain at risk. There's still significant investor interest in the energy sector. A key factor for investors is the sustainability and resilience of potential acquisition targets.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full838" style="display:none;">According to Moore Global, companies leveraging disruptive technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), will thrive in manufacturing and distribution. Global AI investments in this sector, roughly $50 billion in 2020, are projected to double by 2024. Czech firms face ongoing supply chain disruptions exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.<br><br>Approximately 20% of AI spending is allocated to process automation, with AI-powered machines increasingly replacing repetitive tasks. While manufacturing and distribution have successfully implemented AI, significant potential remains for further integration. Disruptive innovations like cloud technology, digitalization, robotics, the Internet of Things, AI, and augmented/virtual reality are reshaping the global economy.<br><br>A survey reveals that 44% of Czech companies invested 5-20% of their annual budget in digital investments last year, compared to 27% in 2019. Firms recognize digital investment as vital for competitiveness and resilience during crises. A shortage of skilled workers hinders effective digital technology implementation, necessitating employee training and improved education. Augmented and virtual reality are becoming increasingly important in digitizing industry, accelerating processes, enabling remote solutions, and enhancing training. Supply chain issues persist, impacting Czech firms reliant on Russian and Ukrainian markets, with resolution unlikely in the near future.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full839" style="display:none;">Three out of four Czech employees favor a four-day work week, according to a recent survey commissioned by Moore Czech Republic. Nearly half of Czech employees would definitely agree with implementing a four-day work week, and another 28% would likely agree. This interest is higher than it was two years ago, with 67% of respondents expressing a positive view compared to 61% in a previous survey. In both surveys, 65% of employees stated they would dedicate more time to their work if the work week was shortened.<br><br>Around 30% of respondents believe a four-day week would be sufficient to fulfill company obligations without increased productivity, while almost 22% think it would work if employee performance improved. Younger employees are more inclined towards a shorter work week, with about 83% of those aged 18-26 being positive, compared to under 65% for those over 36. Men are generally more skeptical than women.<br><br>Currently, experiments with four-day work weeks are underway across Europe. While the Czech Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs isn't planning a widespread implementation, companies are trying less radical adjustments like flexible work arrangements or home office. Experts believe that adopting a four-day work week could attract employees, especially in the current labor shortage.</p>

For example, it can help in the recruitment process.<br><br>June 29, 2023<br><br>Dozens of percent of Czechs fear losing their jobs due to AI. Experts from the consulting group Moore Czech Republic are mitigating these concerns, predicting that the use of AI will lead to more efficient human work rather than its replacement. According to their estimates, AI will affect almost all industries, primarily administration and financial services. AI will also facilitate the recruitment process in companies. In practice, the recruitment team from Moore Advisory CZ also uses AI, which helps them fill lucrative job positions.<br><br>According to a survey by the Median agency, 31% of Czechs are worried about their jobs due to the rise of AI.<br><br>"AI will undoubtedly replace some job positions, but it will rather make work more efficient overall, and even create a number of new job positions. What is certain in any case is that the rise of AI will transform the structure of the labor market in the Czech Republic and affect almost all industries - initially, it will be administration or financial services," comments Miloslav Rut, partner at Moore Technology CZ, adding that the impact of AI will be felt earlier and more strongly in Western European countries and the USA than in the Czech Republic.<br><br>Twice the response thanks to AI<br><br>AI will also streamline the recruitment process in companies. This is how the Moore Advisory CZ recruitment team uses it.<br><br>"For example, we were filling a product marketing manager position for our client, a large IT company, and it occurred to us that artificial intelligence could help us with this. Thanks to ChatGTP, we created a job description and ultimately filled the position successfully," describes Lucie Krejčová, Recruitment Manager at Moore Advisory CZ. She further explains the use of AI in filling the position in numbers: "The average response rate to our messages on LinkedIn is between 35 and 45%. For this position, the response rate was significantly above average, as it was 70%. We were also able to choose from seven quality candidates, which is again above standard. For most other positions, we aim to offer two to three quality candidates."<br><br>AI seeks new employees<br><br>The scope for the application of AI is great in HR.<br><br>"Currently, artificial intelligence is most often used in sorting resumes. Automating resume screening saves overloaded HR professionals a lot of valuable minutes. Another possible use is in analyzing the applicant's assumptions and - as we have tried ourselves - also in communication with applicants. Last but not least, AI can also be helpful in onboarding and training," explains Lucie Krejčová.<br><br>According to experts, however, human contact will still be needed in HR.<br><br>"For us, artificial intelligence represents a significant streamlining of work, but I dare say that the human factor and soft skills will still play a primary role in our profession. We see artificial intelligence more as a good helper than a thief who will deprive recruiters of their jobs," says Lucie Krejčová from Moore Advisory CZ.<br><br>Artificial intelligence will continue to be used in consulting within Moore Advisory CZ. "Artificial intelligence helps us with the design of texts and procedures in various areas. This includes, for example, procedures for implementing certain measures or proposals for KPIs, which saves consultants time," says Martin Buranský from Moore Advisory CZ. "Although the use of artificial intelligence is an undeniable benefit, it is necessary to check the outputs, both formally and substantively. Sometimes AI is able to come up with real oddities," concludes Martin Buranský.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Experts at Moore Czech Republic predict that AI will enhance work efficiency rather than replace jobs, impacting sectors like administration and finance. A survey indicates 31% of Czechs fear job loss due to AI. AI is already being used to streamline recruitment, improving response rates and candidate quality. For instance, Moore Advisory CZ utilized ChatGPT to create a job description, resulting in a 70% response rate on LinkedIn and a pool of seven qualified candidates. AI is also used for resume screening, applicant analysis, communication, onboarding, and training. While AI aids in designing texts and procedures, human oversight remains essential to prevent errors. Experts believe human interaction and soft skills will still be crucial in HR, viewing AI as a helpful tool rather than a job threat.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full841" style="display:none;">Taxing non-financial benefits could strain wage growth and hinder recruitment efforts for Czech companies, according to experts at Moore Czech Republic. The proposed government consolidation package's limitation on tax advantages for these benefits could negatively impact the labor market and the economy, affecting both employers and employees. Employees often view benefits as part of their compensation, and eliminating them will likely create pressure for wage increases.<br><br>Furthermore, the removal of benefits could make it harder for companies to attract qualified workers in a tight labor market with a chronic shortage of skilled employees. Non-financial benefits are a tool for employers to make job positions more attractive, motivate employees, and build loyalty. The legislative change could also harm third parties, such as sports facilities and cultural event organizers, who benefit from revenue generated through these employee perks. Experts estimate that the planned changes could affect up to three out of four Czech employees. The benefit to the state budget is questionable and doesn't outweigh the potential negative consequences.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full842" style="display:none;">**Moore Advisory CZ: State Could Save Up to CZK 337 Million Annually by Adjusting Payments for Social Service Facilities**<br><br>A Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs analysis by Moore Advisory CZ suggests the state budget could save up to CZK 337 million annually by adjusting payment conditions for selected social service facilities. The study examined the possibility of clients in senior homes, facilities with special regimes, and homes for people with disabilities, or their relatives, contributing to care costs. It found that 52% of clients in these facilities have someone who could potentially contribute, but current willingness to contribute is only 27%.<br><br>The analysis, based on a survey of 1,000 clients, revealed that many clients have relatives who could partially cover the costs. In 40% of cases, the client has a descendant with a maintenance obligation. Proposed mandatory payments would include protective limits for both clients and those obliged to provide support, potentially capped at 20% of remaining income after living expenses. The average cost for basic services in residential facilities was almost CZK 14,500 per month per client as of October 2022. The analysis also considered implementing models similar to those in Germany and Austria, where children of social service clients are obligated to contribute to care based on their financial capacity. While the changes would involve increased personnel costs for financial testing, the net savings could reach CZK 337 million annually.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full843" style="display:none;">Moore Czech Republic acquired Střední škola Spektrum, a secondary school in Mladá Boleslav, reinforcing its commitment to education. This move, bolstering its Moore Academy division, aligns with the growing trend of employer-school collaborations to bridge the gap between education and practical skills. Moore actively supports education through direct activities, the KVASAR project, and partnerships with universities like Sting and the Czech University of Life Sciences.<br><br>The acquisition aims to improve the quality of potential employees amidst a shortage of skilled labor and increasing training times. Moore believes closer collaboration between schools and corporations is crucial for upskilling and reskilling, particularly in digital technologies. Střední škola Spektrum, with its focus on online learning and specialized courses, provides a solid foundation for Moore's expansion in secondary education. Moore also partners with higher education institutions, offering practical experience to students and supporting events like job fairs and conferences, emphasizing the importance of close ties between education and the workforce.

      <p class="full-content" id="full844" style="display:none;">**Key Trends in Finance: Digitalization, AI, and Sustainability**<br><br>Investor interest in fintech startups is declining, according to experts from Moore Global, tempering expectations of revolutionary changes in finance. Many fintech startups have failed to adequately monetize their ideas, losing their competitive edge. However, digitalization, including AI solutions, will play a crucial role in the financial sector's development. Moore Czech Republic experts believe that the level of digitalization in the Czech financial sector is insufficient. Sustainability is also playing an increasingly important role in the world of finance and is gaining traction in the Czech Republic.<br><br>Moore Global has observed increased merger and acquisition activity among fintech startups. Investor interest in the financial sector remains, but it is shifting towards more traditional services or underserved regions. Experts say the Czech Republic lags in technology adoption in the financial sector due to a conservative approach from banks and customers. AI solutions are being used for credit scoring, but the financial sector is sensitive to replacing human interaction. ESG principles are gaining traction in finance, with firms focusing on their environmental impact. Investment managers are building ESG portfolios, and banks are interested in sustainably financing infrastructure projects. ESG principles are becoming more prominent in the Czech financial sector.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full845" style="display:none;">The National Qualification System (NSK) helps individuals seeking better employment by providing state-supported, nationally recognized professional qualifications without formal schooling. A large-scale survey conducted in autumn 2021 and early 2023 as part of the UpSkilling project revealed varying levels of awareness and utilization across target groups: schools, the Labour Office, and employers.<br><br>Labour Office employees demonstrate the highest awareness (94%) and usage (79%) of NSK, primarily for retraining and professional qualification exams. Schools are aware of NSK (77%) and use it for developing educational programs, but active utilization is lower (22%). Employers exhibit the lowest awareness (35%) and usage (10%), though their knowledge and utilization significantly increased between survey rounds.<br><br>Workshops within the UpSkilling project contributed to this positive growth, especially among employers. While NSK usage has doubled, employers still lag behind schools and the Labour Office. Future plans indicate continued use of NSK by all groups for educational and retraining purposes. To maximize NSK's effectiveness, further focus is needed on employer engagement and utilization, particularly through targeted activities like workshops, to ensure all stakeholders benefit from the system.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full846" style="display:none;">Tourism rebounded from Covid last year and is expected to grow this year, with established brands leading the way. Experts at Moore Global anticipate continued expansion in 2023, particularly among large hotel chains adopting the franchise model, which could benefit smaller businesses. Moore Czech Republic predicts global trends like ESG, automation, and "bleisure" (business and leisure travel) will influence the domestic sector. Travel agencies also foresee expansion, reporting significantly higher advance sales.<br><br>While Covid severely impacted tourism, 2022 saw a return of customers, and 2023 promises further growth. Travelers will favor well-known brands, driving expansion for major hotel chains through franchising, offering smaller hotels opportunities to operate under trusted corporate banners. Czech tourism is recovering, with revenues reaching 118 billion crowns in 2022, a 51 billion crown increase year-on-year, but still below the 167 billion crown pre-Covid level in 2019. Adaptation to global trends will be crucial.<br><br>The "bleisure" model is gaining traction, potentially growing by 20% annually. Czech hotels can capitalize on this trend, as well as prioritize ESG principles to attract investment. Automation is also rising in the hospitality sector, and early adoption of technologies like AI will be vital for competitiveness. Travel agencies are anticipating a highly profitable year, with advance sales doubling compared to last year. Popular destinations include Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Spain, and Albania, with growing interest in sightseeing tours.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full847" style="display:none;">Whistleblowers save companies money and improve corporate culture. The announcement system needs to be built now.<br><br>Delays in transposing the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive into Czech law are problematic not only for the Czech Republic, which has been sued by the European Commission as a result, but also for businesses. According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, Czech companies face significant financial losses without an effective internal reporting system. The new legislation, the Whistleblower Protection Act, is intended to protect whistleblowers who report illegal activities within companies. Companies with more than fifty employees will be obligated to establish an internal reporting system, allowing employees to confidentially and anonymously report suspected wrongdoing.<br><br>Experts emphasize the need for companies to proactively create these systems, warning against last-minute panic similar to GDPR implementation. Furthermore, having a robust internal system against corruption can be considered a mitigating circumstance in legal proceedings against a company.<br><br>Financially, whistleblowing can prevent substantial losses. The EU estimates annual losses from the lack of whistleblower protection to be €5.8 to €9.6 billion in public procurement alone. In the Czech Republic, 40% of companies encountering economic crime lost at least CZK 1,200,000. Internal reporting systems aim to address this by making management aware of illegal employee activities.<br><br>Ultimately, fostering a culture that supports whistleblowers, removing the stigma associated with them, is crucial. Whistleblowers contribute to an atmosphere of openness and transparency, improving employee-management relations and reducing the risk of sanctions and customer rejection. Moore Czech Republic offers expertise in creating and managing these effective whistleblower protection systems.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full848" style="display:none;">Big data will enable the optimization of electricity production. Community power plants will be a new trend.<br><br>May 3, 2023<br><br>Experts from the consulting network Moore Global consider adherence to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) principles a condition for maintaining competitiveness in the energy industry. They also point out the possibility of using big data to analyze energy consumption and production to increase efficiency. According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, adapting to the new trend of community power plants will be important for the Czech energy market. These will enable both greater sustainability of the energy industry and more stable energy prices.<br><br>The shift towards renewable sources has been influenced by many factors, including technological advancements and government incentives.<br><br>"Investments in physical infrastructure aimed at reducing carbon emissions are obvious at first glance, but what happens behind the scenes can be equally important. Today, it is possible to collect and analyze vast amounts of information about energy usage. This data can be used to optimize the functioning of energy systems, leading to more efficient and cost-effective energy production and consumption,"<br><br>describes David Tomasi, global leader in energy, mining, and renewables at Moore Global.<br><br>Moore Czech Republic experts add that the Czech Republic can also benefit from optimizing electricity production using big data.<br><br>"For example, the Temelín nuclear power plant wants to save up to 4,000 megawatt-hours of emission-free electricity next year. It intends to achieve this by adjusting the operation of cooling tower pumps and will use big data for this purpose,"<br><br>adds Pavel Drobil, partner at Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>Return to the past<br><br>Energy supply disruptions that Europe has been experiencing since last year have resulted in increased interest in using non-renewable fossil fuels.<br><br>"One of the consequences of the energy crisis is that the emphasis on using energy from renewable sources is practically decreasing. The use of fossil fuels is growing again, and even states are more lenient towards it. We can see this, for example, in Germany, where the lifespan of thermal power plants is being extended,"<br><br>comments Pavel Drobil.<br><br>Czech Republic awaits community power plants<br><br>Experts from Moore Czech Republic believe that the energy market in the Czech Republic will fundamentally change after the adoption of legislation enabling the expansion of community power plants.<br><br>"Peer-to-peer energy sharing within virtual power plants will enable a more environmentally friendly approach and will also contribute to stabilizing energy prices. This type of power plant could cover up to 25% of the total domestic electricity consumption in the future,"<br><br>explains Miroslav Rut, partner at Moore Technology CZ.<br><br>Experts emphasize the importance of ESG principles for competitiveness in the energy sector and highlight the potential of big data to optimize energy production and consumption, leading to greater efficiency and cost savings. The Temelín nuclear power plant is cited as an example of a large entity utilizing big data for operational improvements. The European energy crisis has led to a resurgence in fossil fuel use, with countries extending the lifespans of thermal power plants. For the Czech Republic, a significant transformation in the energy market is anticipated with the introduction of community power plants, which will facilitate peer-to-peer energy sharing and virtual power plants. These community initiatives are expected to enhance environmental sustainability and stabilize energy prices, potentially meeting up to 25% of the country's electricity demand.</p>

      <h2>Cybersecurity Survey of Companies: One in Five Companies Faced an Attack. Only a Quarter Focus on Systematic Prevention</h2>
      <p class="date">06.01.2022</p>

      <p class="summary" id="summary885">**Cybersecurity Survey of Companies: One in Five Faced an Attack. Only a Quarter Focus on Systematic Prevention**<br><br>According to a survey, one in five companies faced a cyberattack, but only a quarter </p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full885" style="display:none;">**Cybersecurity Survey of Companies: One in Five Faced an Attack. Only a Quarter Focus on Systematic Prevention**<br><br>According to a survey, one in five companies faced a cyberattack, but only a quarter proactively address cybersecurity through audits and testing. Despite nearly 60% of companies being completely dependent on computers and internet access, and another third partially dependent, only half consider their security sufficient. Two-thirds recognize the need for increased cybersecurity efforts, but many address issues reactively rather than proactively.<br><br>Martin Listopad from Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the growing risk of attacks that can compromise information and paralyze operations. He stresses the importance of securing access to electronic data and protecting against unauthorized manipulation. The survey found that only a third of companies that experienced a cyberattack in the past three years detected and eliminated it early.<br><br>Although half of the companies address cybersecurity at the management level and acknowledge that stronger protection requires higher investment, proactive investment is generally lower than the potential costs of dealing with an attack. Experts warn that despite widespread awareness, companies often have a lukewarm approach to security, with only a quarter using audits and testing for prevention. Proactive cybersecurity measures can prevent up to 90% of potential attacks. Audits help analyze risks, identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and implement measures to manage situations that could paralyze business operations. Audits also ensure compliance with legal regulations to avoid penalties related to contractual relationships and data protection.</p>

      <h2>The number of cyberattacks has almost doubled. People working from home are the most vulnerable.</h2>
      <p class="date">21.12.2021</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary886">**Translation:**<br><br>The number of cyberattacks has almost doubled. People working from home are the most vulnerable.<br><br>According to cybersecurity experts from Doxologic, attackers are exploiting the COVI</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full886" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>The number of cyberattacks has almost doubled. People working from home are the most vulnerable.<br><br>According to cybersecurity experts from Doxologic, attackers are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic situation, which has moved a large portion of employees to work from home, making their devices more easily vulnerable.<br><br>Doxologic, part of the Moore Czech Republic group, reports that not only public institutions but also private companies are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks. A weak point is the inadequate security of technology when working from home. "Endpoints such as laptops are the gateway to companies and are also the most frequent target of attacks. Through them, attackers can access entire corporate systems," warns Doxologic Director Martin Listopad.<br><br>"Devices directly in the company are usually protected by advanced technologies for the entire organization. Users are hidden behind imaginary ramparts. Unfortunately, many companies have failed to react and protect users who are not currently behind this imaginary rampart," describes Martin Listopad.<br><br>The basis of security is prevention.<br><br>It is important to protect oneself regularly and purposefully and to educate employees.<br><br>"The security policies of organizations should include regular security audits, updates of application versions, regular changes of strong access passwords, and the building of a quality security infrastructure, protecting organizations both against attacks on themselves and through their employees working in the field or from home," reminds Martin Listopad.<br><br>A new trend is so-called triple extortion.<br><br>A common type of attack is ransomware attacks, in which attackers encrypt the data of the affected subject and demand a ransom for decryption. This is the so-called double extortion technique, which was most evident in the case of the attack on Colonial Pipeline.<br><br>"A novelty and an increasingly common phenomenon in 2021 is the technique of triple extortion," states Martin Listopad, adding: "In addition to stealing sensitive data, attackers also target the customers of organizations or their business partners, from whom they also demand a ransom."<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Cyberattacks have surged, particularly targeting employees working from home due to vulnerabilities in their devices and inadequate security measures implemented by companies. Private firms and public institutions alike are facing increased threats, with laptops serving as frequent entry points for attackers. Experts emphasize the importance of prevention through regular security audits, application updates, strong passwords, and robust security infrastructure to protect organizations and remote workers. A concerning trend is the rise of triple extortion, where attackers not only encrypt and steal data but also target customers and business partners, demanding ransoms from all involved. Companies must prioritize employee education and implement comprehensive security policies to mitigate these evolving cyber threats.</p>

      <h2>Czech Republic will not approve whistleblower legislation in time. Nevertheless, some entities must be prepared.</h2>
      <p class="date">04.12.2021</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary887">The Czech Republic will not meet the deadline to approve legislation protecting whistleblowers, who report illegal activities within organizations. Experts say stronger protection could encourage more</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full887" style="display:none;">The Czech Republic will not meet the deadline to approve legislation protecting whistleblowers, who report illegal activities within organizations. Experts say stronger protection could encourage more reporting, shielding individuals from retaliation. Despite the delay, some entities, especially those acting as the "state" like state institutions, local governments, and entities providing public services, may face immediate obligations from the EU Whistleblowing Directive starting December 17, 2021.<br><br>The upcoming legislation will impose duties on employers with at least 25 employees, municipalities with over 5,000 inhabitants, public procurers, and other selected entities, including implementing internal reporting systems and designating individuals to investigate reports. The aim is to create a safe environment, encouraging internal reporting over public disclosure. Retaliation against whistleblowers, like job termination or discrimination, is a concern. Some organizations are proactively preparing for the new rules.<br><br>Failure to comply with the new requirements can result in fines up to one million Czech crowns or 5% of annual turnover. The designated person in charge can be fined up to 100,000 crowns. Furthermore, companies risk reputational damage and potential disclosure of trade secrets if reports are not addressed properly. Whistleblowers are mainly employees reporting wrongdoing witnessed at work, but the law extends to self-employed individuals, members of legal entities' bodies, trainees, suppliers, and job applicants.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full888" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>Many organizations still haven't properly addressed GDPR compliance. The most common mistake is requiring unnecessary consent.<br><br>Despite the difficulty in quantifying them, experts at Moore Czech Republic, which manages personal data for nearly 300 organizations, warn that many face sanctions. The GDPR regulation has been accompanied by many concerns from the outset, causing unnecessary errors that increase the administrative burden.<br><br>Three years after its effective date, many uncertainties still surround GDPR. According to experts at Moore Czech Republic, data processing affects countless fields, and many entities still frequently make mistakes in complying with the legislation. Common errors include processing excessive data, unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and sending unsolicited commercial communications.<br><br>According to Petr Štětka, Manager at Moore Advisory, intentional breaches of personal data security are rare. However, even unintentional violations like data loss or accidental destruction can lead to sanctions, even if all other processes are correctly set up. By April 30, 2021, the Office for Personal Data Protection (ÚOOÚ) received 1065 notifications of serious breaches in personal data processing obligations. However, only 12 fines were issued, totaling over half a million Czech crowns, with the largest fine being 180,000 crowns.<br><br>Besides unintentional oversights, Moore Czech Republic points to gross violations like unmarked camera systems, insufficient information about personal data processing, and excessive consent requests. Many organizations require consent where it's unnecessary, adding administrative burden for themselves and clients. A typical example is human resources and consent for processing personal data for payroll and personnel purposes, where processing is already mandated by law.<br><br>Website and e-shop operators have made the most progress in personal data protection in recent years. However, many still aren't oriented in the current legislation, leading to errors. For example, a COVID-19 testing site used an outdated law in its privacy form, signaling a lack of proper GDPR implementation. Such shortcomings can be easily rectified by collaborating with GDPR experts.<br><br>Experts attribute the current situation partly to a lack of attention and communication from the state. GDPR was approved in April 2016 and came into effect in May 2018, giving ample time for awareness. The inadequate information campaign led to unnecessary panic among data processors and the public. The delayed approval of the Czech adaptation law nearly a year after GDPR's effective date added to the uncertainty. This uncertainty and fear-mongering led to an exaggerated perception that even simple actions like introductions would require consent.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Many organizations still struggle with GDPR compliance three years after its implementation, facing potential sanctions. Common errors include excessive data processing, unauthorized disclosure, unsolicited communication, and requiring unnecessary consent, often stemming from uncertainty and misinterpretation of the regulations. The Office for Personal Data Protection has received numerous breach notifications, but issued relatively few fines. While website and e-shop operators have made progress, many businesses still rely on outdated legal frameworks. Experts blame inadequate state communication, delayed adaptation law, and fear-mongering for the widespread confusion and panic. Organizations can easily improve GDPR compliance through cooperation with GDPR experts. Unnecessary bureaucracy has been the result of the misconception of GDPR regulations, causing a lot of confusion.</p>

      <h2>Government Investment in Research and Development Significantly Increased, Yet the Czech Republic Lags Behind the EU Average</h2>
      <p class="date">15.11.2021</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary889">Government investment in research and development (R&D) has significantly increased in the Czech Republic, but the country still lags behind the EU average. In 2020, the Czech Republic invested 128 eu</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full889" style="display:none;">Government investment in research and development (R&D) has significantly increased in the Czech Republic, but the country still lags behind the EU average. In 2020, the Czech Republic invested 128 euros per capita, falling short of the EU average. Experts at Moore Czech Republic emphasize the importance of maintaining this funding trend to transform the Czech economy into a high-value-added, advanced economy.<br><br>In 2020, total government R&D spending in the EU surpassed 100 million euros, a 22% increase compared to 2010. Czech government R&D spending has increased by 42.7 euros per capita in the last decade; despite this 50% growth, the Czech Republic ranks 15th among EU member states. Experts highlight that R&D investment is critical for the Czech Republic's economic transformation, particularly during the post-pandemic recovery. Government R&D investments also stimulate private investment.<br><br>Private R&D investment in the Czech Republic is also below average. Almost 60% of companies reduced their science and research budgets. The absence of incentives for businesses to invest is a major factor. Experts suggest adjusting the National Recovery Plan to support private sector investment and collaboration with universities, potentially through tax breaks, project funding, and other forms of cooperation. The Czech Republic is the leader in R&D investment among the Visegrad Four countries, but still behind compared to Scandinavian countries, Austria, and Germany.</p>

      <h2>A complete cancellation of EET doesn't make sense. Supporting at least voluntary registration is an option.</h2>
      <p class="date">01.11.2021</p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="summary" id="summary890">**Translation:**<br><br>Completely abolishing the Electronic Records of Sales (EET) doesn't make sense. Supporting at least voluntary registration is an option.<br><br>According to experts from Moore Czech Republ</p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full890" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>Completely abolishing the Electronic Records of Sales (EET) doesn't make sense. Supporting at least voluntary registration is an option.<br><br>According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, the state would voluntarily cut off a tool for easy allocation of subsidies based on recorded revenue and lose the ability to monitor the economy in various business sectors and regions. Given the significant investments made by businesses, the established public administration apparatus, progress in digitization, and other benefits of EET, it should be preserved, at least on a voluntary basis through a minor amendment to the law.<br><br>Political infighting has placed the forming government coalition in a difficult position. Abolishing EET would mean the future government is consciously giving up a tool that could help restart tax collection from small and medium-sized businesses and could be used as a platform for issuing electronic receipts.<br><br>Introducing EET in the 3rd and 4th waves would help modernize the POS systems of this group of entrepreneurs, including adding payment card acceptance. The support of POS system modernization and non-cash payment terminals is currently an initiative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Czech Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>If the new government doesn't want to force entrepreneurs to use EET, the system can be made voluntary. Honest entrepreneurs want to pay taxes and don't want to be forced into the grey economy by unfair competition. The state could reward them with easier access to incentives and subsidies or better conditions for investments in digitalization.<br><br>Re-starting revenue recording in a voluntary mode, coupled with a set of advantages and incentives for entrepreneurs, can be a positive signal, which the new government could declare both the effort to manage and improve the economy, and to solve the country's debt. Voluntary EET for the 3rd and 4th wave can be introduced almost immediately with a minor amendment to the EET law. The law is already drafted, and its implementation depends on the will of the future political representatives.<br><br>EET was introduced in the Czech Republic at the end of 2016 with the intention of better tax collection by registering cash payments, eliminating the grey economy and leveling the competitive playing field.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Experts argue against completely abolishing the Electronic Records of Sales (EET), suggesting a voluntary system. Abolishing EET would hinder tax collection, economic monitoring, and the modernization of payment systems, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. A voluntary EET (DEET) would allow honest entrepreneurs to comply while receiving benefits like easier access to subsidies and digitalization investments. This approach signals a positive change, promoting economic health and rewarding compliance. A simple amendment to the existing law could implement voluntary EET quickly, offering a less repressive and more supportive environment for businesses. This also furthers the digitalization of the economy and streamlines business-government communication. Introduced in 2016, EET aimed to improve tax collection and reduce the grey economy.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full891" style="display:none;">According to a MoorenTechnology study, while the Czech Republic has seen the largest increase in female ICT professionals in the EU over the past decade, it still ranks among the countries with the lowest representation of women in the field, at 11%. Across the EU, men dominate the ICT sector, accounting for 83% of the workforce, a 3% increase since 2010. Despite various initiatives promoting women in ICT in the Czech Republic, the gender imbalance persists. Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of female ICT students in the Czech Republic rose from 11.5% to 17%. Experts emphasize that increased female participation is crucial to address labor shortages in the well-compensated ICT sector and could help reduce the gender pay gap. Although the Czech Republic shows improvement, it still lags behind other EU nations, with Denmark leading with a 33% female representation in ICT.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full892" style="display:none;">Call-offs, reflecting current part needs, are haunting automotive subcontractors, potentially leading to existential crises within three months. Industrial production in the Czech Republic decreased in August, with the automotive sector falling by over 28%. Moore Czech Republic forecasts this may last 3-4 months before some subcontractors face significant problems, with normalization expected no sooner than late in the first half of next year.<br><br>Chip supply lead times have lengthened to 21 weeks, the longest since 2017. Experts estimate the chip crisis will cost automakers over 4 trillion Czech crowns in lost revenue. Order cancellations are impacting the entire supply chain which operates on a "just in time" principle. Subcontractors heavily reliant on the automotive sector face the most severe issues, prompting them to diversify their customer base. Shifting to other sectors is challenging financially, technically, and logistically. Some manufacturers are temporarily using employer-side obstacles to reduce costs, though this must be done carefully to avoid employee attrition in a competitive labor market. Possible solutions include delivering cars with temporarily unavailable non-essential features.</p>

A significant change is the requirement for beneficial owners of corporations to be natural persons. Complex ownership structures must trace the beneficial owner to the ultimate natural person. If this identification is impossible, individuals in top management, such as board members, will be registered as beneficial owners. The law also introduces an "automatic registration" for companies with simple ownership structures, especially when the beneficial owner is evident from the commercial register.<br><br>A beneficial owner is defined as any natural person who is the ultimate beneficiary or has ultimate control, either directly or indirectly. This includes individuals who could receive a substantial portion of the entity's profits or those who can exert decisive influence.<br><br>For corporations, this includes individuals entitled to over 25% of the profit, assets, or liquidation balance, or those holding a significant share of voting rights exceeding 25%. Failure to register can result in fines of up to 500,000 CZK for individuals, prohibition of profit distribution, or restriction of voting rights in the company's highest governing body. The new law is taken seriously and should be handled with urgency. A portion of the beneficial owner register will also be publicly accessible through the Ministry of Justice's website.</p>

Trained on over 20 billion smart meter measurements, it maps energy grid behavior, detects electricity theft (2.5 times more effectively than traditional methods), predicts water and gas pipeline failures, and helps manage the integration of electric vehicles and renewable energy sources.<br><br>VGA creates a 3D digital twin of the distribution network, displaying real-time data and analytical results in an understandable format. This allows for better understanding of the network's behavior as a whole, identifying problems and their impacts. The technology isn't limited to electricity; it works for water, gas, and heat distribution, analyzing data, predicting consumer behavior, and detecting anomalies. For water and gas networks, it can prevent failures by evaluating pressure.<br><br>Mycroft Mind, part of Moore Czech Republic, specializes in data collection, processing, and advanced analytics for technical networks using machine learning. They have worked with various clients, including energy distributors and manufacturers. VGA also considers weather conditions and seasonal changes in its analysis.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full908" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>Most Czechs would welcome a four-day work week. Companies also see benefits in it, but are not yet considering its implementation. Nearly four out of ten people currently work more than 40 hours a week. A survey conducted by Ipsos for Moore Czech Republic revealed that two-thirds of managers of small and medium-sized companies are also positive about the idea. However, one-fifth of managers believe that such a move would be detrimental to companies.<br><br>The proposed shortened work week would involve limiting work to four days, reducing working hours from 40 to 35. Sixty percent of Czechs would like this, even if it meant working more intensely during those four days. However, over a fifth would not welcome a shorter work week, preferring to spread their work over five days for a calmer pace.<br><br>Almost two-thirds of managers believe it would increase productivity and employee satisfaction. Conversely, over a fifth believe it would harm companies, reducing work output and performance. Only thirteen percent of managers are considering implementing a shortened work week in the next five years; a quarter reject the idea, and half are unsure. One-fifth believe all weekly work duties could be completed in four days without increased daily productivity. One-third believe it would only be possible with increased productivity. Sixteen percent of managers say even five days are not enough.<br><br>In Europe, a maximum 40-hour work week is most common. The longest working hours are in Liechtenstein and Switzerland (up to 50 hours), while the shortest are in France, Denmark, and Belgium (38 hours). A four-day work week cannot be implemented in every industry or for every position, especially where employees need to be readily available to customers.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>A survey in the Czech Republic reveals that a majority of Czechs and a significant portion of managers in small to medium-sized businesses are in favor of a four-day work week. Most Czechs surveyed, and a two-thirds of managers believed it would increase productivity and employee satisfaction. However, concerns exist regarding the feasibility of completing all tasks in a shorter timeframe, with some fearing reduced work output and performance.<br><br>While many are open to the idea, only a small percentage of companies are actively considering implementation in the near future. A significant portion of managers believes increased daily productivity would be necessary to make a four-day work week viable. Some believe that five days are needed to complete the work. The study also points out that implementing a four-day work week might not be suitable for all industries, especially those requiring constant employee availability. The 40-hour week remains the most common in Europe, with shorter and longer averages existing in specific countries.</p>

On the other hand, companies involved in technology development or industrial automation will be in a stronger position vis-à-vis investors. Generational change in family businesses, which began in our region approximately five years ago, may also increase the number of transactions.<br><br>According to the consulting company Moore Czech Republic, the pandemic favors large players in the market in terms of transaction activity, especially in gastronomy and tourism, i.e. in areas that have been most affected by anti-epidemic measures.<br><br>"Investors who have sufficient capital will be able to acquire these assets at lower prices, consolidate them and build larger units. We therefore expect transaction activity in these sectors to increase by a lower tens of percent this year compared to last year," says Petr Kymlička, partner at Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>The price of technology companies will increase<br><br>The past period, on the other hand, strengthened companies that deal with industrial automation, the development of technologies for complex remote work, or virtual and augmented reality. This makes it possible, for example, to introduce highly efficient remote repair and maintenance processes.<br><br>"It can be expected that companies from these fields will be in demand on the market and demand for them will increase. They will therefore be traded at higher prices than in the previous period. These companies are aware of the lack of human resources, which they are replacing with their technologies. The mentioned effect was exacerbated by the pandemic, especially in industrial enterprises, where a large part of foreign workers ceased to be available," explains Petr Kymlička.<br><br>According to Moore Czech Republic, there will also be an intensification of generational change in the ownership of family businesses in the coming years. This process began to appear more significantly among Czech companies in the last five years, and should gain momentum this year and next year.<br><br>"The current situation will strengthen the motivation of the current generation of owners to hand over companies to the younger generation. The latter, on the other hand, will show greater reluctance and fear of taking over companies on their own responsibility," adds Václav Škapa, partner of the company and expert in transaction consulting. For these reasons, according to him, the role of foreign strategic investors, whose aim is to strengthen their position in the region, could strengthen on the Czech market.<br><br>The second half of the year in the sign of growth<br><br>According to Moore Czech Republic, the growth of transaction activities will be reflected only in the second half of the year. There will also be a "restart" of transactions that were delayed or interrupted last year.<br><br>"Despite significant restrictions in 2020, we managed to complete twenty medium-sized transactions across various segments of the economy, especially in industry and technology. The number of active mandates increased by fifteen percent year-on-year," says Václav Škapa. A factor that could slow down mergers and acquisitions, on the other hand, are differences in price expectations.<br><br>"While sellers will tend to base their expectations on performance in times of growth, buyers will take into account risk factors in valuations that they did not take into account a year ago. Overall, however, we see 2021 as very promising from the point of view of transaction consulting," adds Petr Kymlička.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Moore Czech Republic anticipates increased transactional activity in sectors heavily impacted by the pandemic, such as gastronomy and tourism, as larger companies capitalize on distressed assets. Conversely, technology and industrial automation firms will command higher prices due to increased demand fueled by labor shortages and the need for remote solutions. A generational shift in family business ownership, already underway, is expected to accelerate, potentially driving more foreign strategic investment as younger generations express reluctance to take over. While differing price expectations between buyers and sellers may pose a hurdle, the overall outlook for transactional consulting in 2021 is positive, particularly in the latter half of the year, as delayed transactions resume and activity increases in industry and technology.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full911" style="display:none;">Asian economies are outpacing Europe in economic growth due to their faster recovery from the pandemic. China's economy, for example, rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in the last quarter of 2020, while the EU economy contracted by 6.4% in the same year. China's GDP grew by 2.3% in 2020, exceeding 100 trillion yuan. The EU economy, however, shrank by 6.4%, with Spain, Italy, and France experiencing the largest declines. The Czech Republic fared better with a 5.6% decrease.<br><br>Asian economies are benefiting from China's stable supply chain and are not hindered by the strict restrictions seen in Europe. Japan and South Korea are also experiencing economic growth. While Japan's GDP declined in the first half of 2020, it rebounded in the third and fourth quarters. South Korea also saw growth in the latter half of the year, nearly returning to pre-pandemic levels. China's import and export values increased by 1.6% year-on-year. However, the tourism sector is weakening across Asia. While China's PMI was lower than the EU's at the end of the year, retail sales increased, and unemployment stabilized, with 12 million new jobs created.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full914" style="display:none;">A pending amendment to the law could mandate data mailboxes for a broader range of legal entities and the self-employed, in addition to companies. If passed, the amendment would significantly expand the circle of legal entities and self-employed individuals who would automatically receive a data mailbox. In certain cases, even non-business citizens could be issued data mailboxes.<br><br>The amendment aims to simplify establishing data mailboxes for both individuals and legal entities. Currently, data mailboxes are automatically created only for legal entities registered in the commercial register (firms). The amendment would extend this to other legal entities "registered in the register of persons," such as foundations and associations, as well as self-employed individuals.<br><br>The amendment could also change the automatic creation of data mailboxes for ordinary citizens after they first use a qualified electronic identification method. The proposal also unifies the delivery of private and public law documents. Documents are considered delivered when the authorized person logs into the data mailbox, or after 10 days if they don't log in. The goal is to prevent obstructions in delivering private law documents. The amendment should contribute to greater security of electronic communication and the overall development of eGovernment.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full922" style="display:none;">In five years, the Czech esports community is projected to reach half a million people, while in Germany, esports is already recognized as a full-fledged sport. Esports is globally gaining prominence, attracting players, viewers, and sponsors. Viewership of esports events already surpasses traditional sports events. In the Czech Republic, roughly three million people are connected to esports, with an active core of 350,000 players and fans. This exceeds the number of registered members in the Czech Football Association.<br><br>If the Czech esports market follows global growth trends of 10-12% annually, it could reach 550,000-600,000 active participants in five years, with a market value potentially reaching 600 million Czech crowns by 2025, driven by technology, advertising and sponsorships. While traditional sports receive national support, esports currently doesn't, but has the potential to grow rapidly. Germany's recognition of esports clubs as non-profits provides a model for the Czech Republic to enhance its competitiveness.<br><br>The Czech Electronic Sport Association (CESA) is working to create a stable and ethical esports environment and advocating for state recognition of esports as a legitimate sport. Inclusion of esports in the Olympics is also considered as a potential path for further global development.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full923" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>The pandemic highlighted the need to prepare government officials for remote work. Equipment, security, and training will cost tens of billions. The pandemic accelerated the shift to online operations for many companies, prompting them to adopt mandatory or recommended "home office" policies. However, the transition to remote work for civil servants was often complicated or even impossible.<br><br>Changing operational models is easier in the private sector than in public administration. Companies can relatively easily replace or modify their IT systems and infrastructure or change their processes. In the public sector, such changes are more complex due to technical limitations, information security requirements, and the inability to react quickly to infrastructure adjustments.<br><br>Documents often cannot leave government buildings, and legislation for remote work is still not fully defined. While the public administration has been working on digitization for several years, the emergency situation revealed that offices are not fully prepared for remote work. The pandemic has accelerated plans to strengthen both cybersecurity and infrastructure to meet future needs.<br><br>Besides security enhancements, public administration workers need adequate equipment and training for remote access. The state had considered these measures previously, but cybersecurity was not a priority. Massively strengthening information and communication technologies in the public sector will require significant investments in technology and human resources. Failure to prioritize this area could lead to significant damage from cybercrime. The transition to a virtual office concept will take several years.<br><br>In addition to technology and remote work procedures, the state sphere lacks modern, single-purpose administrative applications for efficient automation of administrative processes. Modernizing and automating internal processes to enable full remote operation during similar disruptions will take several years, including legislative changes, supplier selection, and implementation.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the unpreparedness of the Czech public administration for remote work, unlike the private sector which adapted relatively easily. Civil servants faced challenges due to outdated IT infrastructure, security concerns, legislative gaps, and the inability to access physical documents. Addressing this requires significant investments, estimated at tens of billions, in cybersecurity, equipment, and training to enable secure and efficient remote access for government employees. Modernization also necessitates developing single-purpose administrative applications for process automation. ICT union stated that transitioning to a fully functional virtual office concept will be a multi-year endeavor, requiring legislative adjustments, vendor selection, and implementation. Prioritizing these improvements is crucial to prevent future disruptions and minimize potential damage from cybercrime, ensuring the public sector can operate effectively in emergencies.</p>
