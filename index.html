      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_0" style="display:none;">The Slovak Republic has amended its law on securities and investment services to align with the establishment of the European Single Access Point (ESAP). ESAP provides centralized access to publicly available information on financial services, capital markets, and sustainability. The amendment also includes mandatory reporting on crypto-assets for payment and investment purposes, related to the DAC8 Directive.<br><br>ESAP, operated by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), will increase administrative requirements for businesses and public administration to improve product and market transparency. Various entities involved in securities trading and capital market activities must submit specific information to ESAP, including descriptions of legal forms and organizational structures, takeover bid details, shareholder engagement policies, and covered bond information.<br><br>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) will also be required to disclose information about remedial measures, penalties, and forced administration of securities traders, starting after January 9, 2030.<br><br>Certain companies, such as banks, insurance companies, and listed companies exceeding specific size criteria, will be required to submit financial statements, audit reports, annual reports, sustainability reports, and assurance reports to ESAP through a specialized portal operated by the financial directorate. This differs from the current accounting register, where all accounting entities submit documents. The amendment incorporates ESAP obligations into the Commercial Code, the Banking Act, and the Accounting Act. Further details on the ESAP procedure are available on the European ESAP portal.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_0" style="display:none;">スロバキア共和国は、欧州単一アクセスポイント（ESAP）の創設に伴い、証券・投資サービス関連法を改正しました。ESAPは、金融サービスや資本市場、サステナビリティに関する公開情報に一元的にアクセスできるプラットフォームです。今回の法改正では、DAC8指令に基づき、決済や投資を目的とした暗号資産に関する報告も義務付けられました。<br><br>欧州証券市場監督局（ESMA）が運営するESAPの導入により、商品や市場の透明性を高めるため、企業や行政の事務負担が増加します。証券取引や資本市場に関わる事業体は、法人形態、組織構造、株式公開買付（TOB）の詳細、株主との対話方針、カバードボンド（担保付債券）に関する情報などをESAPへ提出する必要があります。<br><br>また、スロバキア国立銀行（NBS）は、2030年1月10日以降、証券会社に対する是正措置や罰則、強制管理といった情報を開示することが求められます。<br><br>銀行、保険会社、および一定規模を超える上場企業などは、財務局が運営する専用ポータルを通じて、財務諸表、監査報告書、年次報告書、サステナビリティ報告書などをESAPへ提出する義務を負います。これは、すべての企業が書類を提出する現行の会計登録制度とは異なります。ESAPに関するこれらの義務は、商法、銀行法、会計法にも盛り込まれています。手続きの詳細は、欧州ESAPのポータルサイトで確認できます。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_0" style="display:none;">斯洛伐克共和国已修订其《证券与投资服务法》，以响应欧盟“欧洲单一接入点”（ESAP）的建立。ESAP是一个集中平台，用于提供金融服务、资本市场及可持续发展相关的公开信息。此外，该修正案还依据欧盟《DAC8指令》，增加了对用于支付和投资目的的加密资产的强制性报告要求。<br><br>ESAP由欧洲证券和市场管理局（ESMA）运营，它的推行将提高产品与市场的透明度，但同时也会增加企业和公共管理部门的管理要求。各类从事证券交易和资本市场活动的主体，必须向ESAP提交特定信息，例如公司的法律形式和组织架构说明、收购要约详情、股东沟通政策以及资产担保债券等相关信息。<br><br>斯洛伐克国家银行（NBS）也须履行信息披露义务，自2030年1月9日起，需公布对证券交易商采取的纠正措施、处罚决定以及强制管理等信息。<br><br>此外，部分企业，如银行、保险公司以及超过特定规模的上市公司，未来需要通过财政总署运营的专门门户网站，向ESAP提交财务报表、审计报告、年度报告、可持续发展报告及鉴证报告。这与当前所有会计主体都向会计登记系统提交文件的做法有所不同。目前，ESAP的相关义务已被纳入斯洛伐克的《商法典》、《银行法》和《会计法》。关于ESAP操作流程的更多细节，可在其欧洲官方门户网站上查询。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_0" style="display:none;">슬로바키아 공화국이 유럽 단일 접근 지점(ESAP) 도입에 맞춰 증권 및 투자 서비스 관련 법을 개정했습니다.

ESAP 절차에 대한 자세한 내용은 유럽 ESAP 포털에서 확인할 수 있습니다.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_2" style="display:none;">The European Commission has updated its list of high-risk countries with strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes, known as the "grey" and "black" lists. EU entities subject to AML regulations must apply enhanced due diligence to transactions involving these countries. This system protects the EU's financial system.<br><br>The updated "grey list" sees the removal of the United Arab Emirates, Barbados, Gibraltar, Jamaica, Panama, the Philippines, Senegal, and Uganda, signaling the EU's recognition of their improved AML/CFT frameworks and regulatory controls. This delisting brings benefits such as reduced regulatory scrutiny, smoother cross-border operations, and sustained international financial competitiveness. Croatia, Mali, and Tanzania have also been removed from the monitoring list. The complete list of countries under increased surveillance is published by the FATF.<br><br>The "black list" includes North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar (Burma), countries with the most severe strategic deficiencies in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The FATF urges member states to apply enhanced due diligence and, in serious cases, countermeasures to protect the international financial system. The next assessment will be published after the plenary meeting in October 2025.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_2" style="display:none;">欧州委員会は、マネーロンダリングおよびテロ資金供与対策（AML/CFT）が不十分とされる高リスク国リスト（通称「グレーリスト」「ブラックリスト」）を更新しました。EU域内の金融機関などは、これらの国が関わる取引に対しては顧客管理を強化することが義務付けられており、この仕組みがEUの金融システムを保護しています。<br><br>今回の更新で「グレーリスト」からは、アラブ首長国連邦、バルバドス、ジブラルタル、ジャマイカ、パナマ、フィリピン、セネガル、ウガンダが除外されました。これは、各国の対策や規制が改善されたとEUが評価したことを意味します。リストから除外されることで、規制上の監視が緩和され、国際取引が円滑になるなど、国際金融市場での競争力を維持しやすくなるという利点があります。また、クロアチア、マリ、タンザニアも監視対象から外れました。なお、監視強化対象国の全リストはFATF（金融活動作業部会）が公表しています。<br><br>「ブラックリスト」には、北朝鮮、イラン、ミャンマーが含まれます。これらの国は、マネーロンダリング、テロ資金供与、大量破壊兵器の拡散防止対策が著しく欠如しているとされています。FATFは、国際金融システムを保護するため、加盟国に対して顧客管理の強化や、深刻な場合には対抗措置を講じるよう要請しています。次回の見直しは、2025年10月のFATF総会後に発表される予定です。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_2" style="display:none;">为了保护欧盟金融体系，欧盟委员会更新了其高风险国家名单，该名单列出了在反洗钱与反恐怖融资（AML/CFT）机制方面存在重大缺陷的国家，通常被称为“灰名单”和“黑名单”。根据规定，欧盟的金融机构及相关企业在与名单上的国家进行交易时，必须采取更严格的审查措施。<br><br>在更新后的“灰名单”中，阿联酋、巴巴多斯、直布罗陀、牙买加、巴拿马、菲律宾、塞内加尔和乌干达被移出。这表明欧盟认可了这些国家在完善反洗钱与反恐怖融资法律框架和监管方面取得的进步。被移出名单后，这些国家将面临更少的监管审查，其跨境业务的开展将更加顺畅，国际金融竞争力也得以巩固。此外，克罗地亚、马里和坦桑尼亚也已从监控名单中移除。完整的受加强监控国家名单由金融行动特别工作组（FATF）发布。<br><br>“黑名单”上的国家包括朝鲜、伊朗和缅甸，这些国家在打击洗钱、恐怖融资和防止大规模杀伤性武器扩散方面存在最严重的制度缺陷。金融行动特别工作组（FATF）敦促各成员国对这些国家采取更严格的审查，并在必要时实施反制措施，以保护国际金融体系。下一次评估结果将于2025年10月的全体会议后公布。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_2" style="display:none;">유럽연합 집행위원회(EC)는 자금세탁방지 및 테러자금조달금지(AML/CFT) 체제에 중요한 미비점이 있는 고위험 국가 명단, 즉 '그레이리스트'와 '블랙리스트'를 최근 업데이트했습니다.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_4" style="display:none;">In early June 2025, the Slovak Parliament approved a government bill amending the excise duty law on electricity, coal, and natural gas. The aim is to reduce administrative burdens for consumers during registration, adapt legislation to current trends, and promote electronic processes.<br><br>The amendment introduces new definitions like "electricity company," "electricity supplier," "gas company," and "gas supplier." It exempts from taxation electricity produced or consumed by an entity with a total installed capacity not exceeding 5 MWh, excluding electricity generated from coal, natural gas, or mineral oil.<br><br>The bill mandates registration for authorized consumers of tax-exempt electricity, coal, and natural gas. Applicants must provide details on usage, consumption volume, meter number, business license, and a declaration confirming the electricity's exclusive use for specified purposes. The Bratislava Customs Office must process applications within 30 days. Suppliers cannot provide tax-exempt electricity to authorized consumers without a permit, except for household end-users.<br><br>The law specifies conditions under which the right to use tax-exempt electricity ceases, including business registry deletion, bankruptcy, liquidation, repeated misuse, or failure to pay penalties. The definition and tax rates for natural gas are updated, differentiating rates based on usage: heating fuel (€1.32/MWh), motor fuel (€9.36/MWh), and other purposes (€1.32/MWh). The law takes effect on July 1, 2025.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The Slovak Parliament passed an amendment to the excise duty law on electricity, coal, and natural gas, effective July 1, 2025. This aims to simplify registration for consumers, modernize the legislation, and encourage digital processes within the energy sector. Key changes include new definitions for energy companies and suppliers, an electricity tax exemption for small producers (under 5 MWh), and mandatory registration for authorized consumers using tax-exempt energy. Applicants must provide usage details and ensure compliance. The Bratislava Customs Office is responsible for permit processing. The law outlines conditions for permit termination, such as business closure or misuse. Furthermore, the law updates the definition of natural gas and sets differentiated tax rates based on its usage as heating or motor fuel. This amendment seeks to streamline procedures, prevent misuse, and adapt to evolving energy practices.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_4" style="display:none;">2025年6月、スロバキア議会は電気・石炭・天然ガスに関する物品税法の改正案を可決しました。この新法は2025年7月1日から施行されます。<br><br>改正の目的は、消費者の登録手続きに関する行政負担を軽減し、法規制を現代の動向に適応させ、エネルギー分野の電子化を推進することです。<br><br>主な変更点として、「電力会社」や「ガス供給者」などの新たな用語が定義されます。また、総設備容量が5MWhを超えない事業者が生産・消費する電力は非課税となりますが、石炭や天然ガスなどを原料とする発電は対象外です。<br><br>非課税エネルギーを利用する認定消費者は、事前の登録が義務付けられます。申請者は、エネルギーの使用目的、消費量、事業許可証などの詳細を提出する必要があり、手続きはブラチスラヴァ税関が担当します。事業の廃止、破産、度重なる不正利用など、特定の条件下では非課税の承認が取り消される規定も盛り込まれました。<br><br>さらに、天然ガスの定義も更新され、暖房用燃料、自動車用燃料など、用途に応じて異なる税率が設定されます。この法改正は、手続きの合理化、不正利用の防止、そして変化するエネルギー事情への対応を目指すものです。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_4" style="display:none;">斯洛伐克议会于2025年6月初批准了一项能源消费税法修正案，该法案将于同年7月1日生效。此举旨在简化消费者注册流程，使法规适应行业发展趋势，并推广能源领域的电子化操作。<br><br>法案要点如下：<br><br>1.  **税收豁免与定义更新**：法案引入了“电力公司”、“燃气供应商”等新定义。对于总装机容量不超过5兆瓦时的实体，其生产或消耗的电力可免征消费税，但利用煤炭、天然气或矿物油发电的情况不在此列。<br><br>2.  **授权用户注册**：使用免税电力、煤炭和天然气的用户必须进行注册。申请人需提供能源用途、消耗量、电表号、营业执照等信息，并声明能源仅用于特定目的。除家庭终端用户外，供应商不得向未获许可的授权用户提供免税能源。审批工作由布拉迪斯拉发海关办公室在30天内完成。<br><br>3.  **许可终止条件**：法案明确，若用户出现企业注销、破产清算、滥用免税资格或未支付罚款等情况，其使用免税能源的权利将被终止。<br><br>4.  **天然气分类税率**：法案更新了天然气的定义，并根据用途设定了不同的税率：供暖燃料为每兆瓦时1.32欧元，车用燃料为每兆瓦时9.36欧元，其他用途为每兆瓦时1.32欧元。<br><br>总而言之，该修正案通过简化手续、防止滥用和适应行业变化，致力于优化斯洛伐克的能源税收管理。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_4" style="display:none;">2025년 6월 초, 슬로바키아 의회는 전기, 석탄, 천연가스에 대한 소비세법 개정안을 승인했습니다. 이번 개정안은 소비자의 등록 절차상 행정적 부담을 줄이고, 최신 동향에 맞춰 법률을 현대화하며, 전자 행정 절차를 활성화하는 것을 목표로 합니다.<br><br>개정안은 '전력 회사', '전력 공급자', '가스 회사', '가스 공급자'와 같은 용어를 새롭게 정의합니다. 또한 총 설비 용량 5MWh를 초과하지 않는 사업자가 생산하거나 소비하는 전력에 대해 세금을 면제하지만, 석탄, 천연가스, 광물유로 생산된 전력은 면세 대상에서 제외됩니다.<br><br>면세 대상 전기, 석탄, 천연가스를 사용하는 '승인된 소비자'는 의무적으로 등록해야 합니다. 신청자는 사용 용도, 소비량, 계량기 번호, 사업자 면허 등의 정보를 제공하고, 해당 전력이 지정된 목적으로만 사용된다는 서약서를 제출해야 합니다. 브라티슬라바 세관은 30일 이내에 신청을 처리해야 하며, 공급업체는 가정용 최종 사용자를 제외하고는 허가 없이 승인된 소비자에게 면세 전력을 공급할 수 없습니다.<br><br>이 법은 사업자 등록 말소, 파산, 청산, 반복적인 규정 위반, 과태료 미납 등의 경우 면세 전력 사용 권리가 소멸되는 조건들을 명시합니다. 천연가스에 대한 정의와 세율도 개정되어, 난방용 연료(MWh당 1.32유로), 차량용 연료(MWh당 9.36유로), 기타 목적(MWh당 1.32유로)으로 용도에 따라 세율을 차등 적용합니다. 이 법은 2025년 7월 1일부터 시행됩니다.<br><br>**요약:**<br><br>슬로바키아 의회가 전기, 석탄, 천연가스에 대한 소비세법 개정안을 통과시켰으며, 2025년 7월 1일부터 시행됩니다. 이 개정안은 소비자의 등록 절차를 간소화하고, 관련 법규를 현대화하며, 에너지 부문의 디지털화를 촉진하는 데 목적이 있습니다. 주요 변경 사항으로는 에너지 회사 및 공급자에 대한 새로운 정의 신설, 소규모 생산자(5MWh 미만)에 대한 전력세 면제, 면세 에너지를 사용하는 승인된 소비자에 대한 의무 등록 제도 도입 등이 있습니다. 신청자는 사용 내역을 상세히 제출하고 규정을 준수해야 하며, 허가 절차는 브라티슬라바 세관이 담당합니다. 또한, 사업 폐쇄나 규정 위반 등 허가 취소 조건도 명시하고 있습니다. 더불어 천연가스의 정의를 갱신하고 난방용 및 차량용 등 용도에 따라 세율을 차등 적용합니다. 이번 개정안은 관련 절차를 효율화하고 부정 사용을 방지하며, 변화하는 에너지 환경에 대응하기 위해 마련되었습니다.</p>

Modeled after similar schemes in research and development, it seeks to boost private resources in the sports sector.<br><br>The super deduction, detailed in new legislation, allows corporations and self-employed individuals with business income to deduct expenses related to sports activities, alongside existing sponsorship options. Key conditions include a positive tax base, documented expenses in accounting, and ineligibility for public benefit organizations also claiming tax relief as registered social enterprises.<br><br>The deduction is capped at 50% of expenses, up to €250,000 per tax period. Non-monetary contributions to sports organizations are considered tax-deductible, even if lacking direct connection to taxable income. The Financial Administration will publish lists of taxpayers utilizing the deduction and the sports organizations they support.<br><br>Eligible expenses must be separately accounted for and exclude those receiving public funding. Only non-monetary contributions, sports equipment and facilities, are covered. Concurrently, the bill modifies income tax exemptions for trainers, capping tax-free income at €300 per month from all employers. A corresponding deductible item for social insurance is also defined. Sports support expenses are tax-deductible only after payment and following sponsorship rules.<br><br>The amendment takes effect on January 1, 2026, impacting income from that period onward, including adjustments to payroll forms to accommodate the new income category for tax-exempt trainer earnings.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_5" style="display:none;">スロバキア議会は5月下旬、スポーツ分野への民間投資を促進するため、「スーパー控除」と呼ばれる特別な税制優遇措置を導入する法案を可決しました。この制度は、研究開発分野で導入されている同様の仕組みを参考にしており、スポーツ界へより多くの民間資金を呼び込むことを目指しています。<br><br>この新しい法律のもと、法人および個人事業主は、既存のスポンサー制度とは別に、スポーツ活動に関連する費用を経費として計上できるようになります。適用には、事業が黒字であること、費用が会計帳簿に記録されていることなどの条件があります。ただし、すでに他の税制優遇を受けている一部の公益法人は対象外です。<br><br>控除額には上限があり、支出した費用の50％、または年間最大25万ユーロ（約4200万円）のいずれか低い方となります。また、スポーツ団体への物品や施設といった現物での寄付も、事業の収益に直接結びつかなくても経費として認められます。なお、財務当局は、この制度を利用する企業と、支援を受けるスポーツ団体のリストを公表する予定です。<br><br>対象となる費用は、他の経費とは分けて経理処理する必要があり、国や自治体などから補助金を受けた費用は対象外です。また、控除の対象はスポーツ用品や施設などの現物寄付に限られます。<br><br>この法案には関連する改正も含まれており、スポーツトレーナーの所得税非課税枠が、複数の勤務先からの収入を合算して月額300ユーロ（約5万円）を上限に見直されます。スポーツ支援に関する費用は、実際に支払いが行われ、規定の要件を満たした後に経費として認められます。<br><br>この新しい法律は2026年1月1日から施行され、同日以降の所得に適用されます。これに伴い、トレーナーの非課税所得に対応するため、給与関連の書類様式も変更される予定です。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_5" style="display:none;">五月下旬，斯洛伐克议会批准了一项旨在鼓励私营资本投资体育事业的新法案，推出了一项针对体育投资的“超额税前扣除”政策。该政策借鉴了科研领域的类似激励机制，旨在为体育部门吸引更多社会资源。<br><br>根据新法案，企业和从事商业活动的个体经营者，除了现有的赞助方式外，还可以将支持体育活动的相关费用在税前进行扣除。申请此项优惠需满足几个关键条件：企业必须处于盈利状态，相关支出须有正规的会计记录，并且已经作为注册社会企业享受税收减免的公益组织不能重复申请。<br><br>可扣除的金额上限为实际支出的50%，每个纳税周期最高不超过25万欧元。向体育组织提供的非货币形式的捐助，即使与企业的应税收入没有直接关联，也被视为可税前扣除的费用。税务部门将公布使用此项优惠的纳税人名单及其支持的体育组织。<br><br>符合条件的费用必须独立核算，且不得是已获得公共资金支持的项目。该政策仅涵盖体育器材和设施等实物捐助。<br><br>此外，法案还调整了教练员的个人所得税政策，规定其每月从所有雇主处获得的免税收入上限为300欧元，并明确了相应的社会保险扣除项目。企业对体育事业的支持费用，必须在实际支付并符合相关赞助规定后，才能进行税前扣除。<br><br>该修正案将于2026年1月1日正式生效，适用于该日期后产生的收入。届时，薪资系统也将进行相应调整，以增加教练员免税收入这一新的收入类别。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_5" style="display:none;">지난 5월 말, 슬로바키아 의회는 민간 부문의 스포츠 투자를 활성화하기 위해 '스포츠 투자 특별 세액공제' 법안을 통과시켰습니다. 이 제도는 연구개발(R&D) 분야의 유사한 세금 혜택 제도를 본떠 스포츠 부문에 대한 민간 재원 유입을 확대하는 것을 목표로 합니다.<br><br>새 법안에 따르면, 법인 및 사업 소득이 있는 개인은 기존의 후원 제도와 더불어 스포츠 활동 관련 비용을 추가로 공제받을 수 있습니다. 주요 조건으로는 과세 대상 소득이 있어야 하고, 관련 비용이 회계 장부에 명확히 기록되어야 합니다. 단, 사회적 기업으로 등록되어 이미 세금 감면 혜택을 받는 공익 단체는 중복 적용이 불가능해 대상에서 제외됩니다.<br><br>공제 한도는 지출 비용의 50%이며, 과세 기간당 최대 25만 유로입니다. 스포츠 단체에 대한 현물 기부 역시 과세 소득과 직접적인 관련이 없더라도 세금 공제 대상으로 인정됩니다. 재무 당국은 이 제도를 활용하는 납세자와 이들이 후원하는 스포츠 단체의 명단을 공개할 예정입니다.<br><br>공제 대상 비용은 별도로 회계 처리해야 하며, 정부 지원금을 받은 비용은 제외됩니다. 공제 혜택은 스포츠 장비 및 시설과 같은 현물 기부에만 한정됩니다. 한편, 이번 법안 개정으로 스포츠 지도자의 소득세 비과세 한도도 변경됩니다. 모든 소득원을 합산하여 월 300유로까지만 비과세 혜택이 적용되며, 이에 맞춰 사회 보험료 공제 항목도 신설됩니다. 스포츠 후원 비용은 실제 지출이 완료된 후, 기존 후원 규정에 따라 세금 공제를 받을 수 있습니다.<br><br>이 개정안은 2026년 1월 1일부터 시행되며, 해당 시점 이후에 발생하는 소득부터 적용됩니다. 또한, 지도자의 비과세 소득 항목이 새로 추가됨에 따라 급여 명세서 양식도 함께 변경될 예정입니다.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_7" style="display:none;">The Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) has adopted the DAC9 directive, an EU initiative aimed at enhancing administrative cooperation in tax matters. This directive establishes a framework for exchanging information on the minimum effective taxation of corporate income among EU member states, marking a significant advancement from the initial proposal of October 28, 2024. DAC9 aims to improve tax cooperation and ensure compliance for multinational and large domestic groups, aligning with the G20/OECD's Pillar II framework.<br><br>A key feature is the implementation of a standardized Globe Information Return (GIR) form, expected to be released in January 2025, facilitating the automatic exchange of tax-related information. It also aims to prevent tax base erosion and profit shifting, enforce minimum taxation for multinationals, and ensure adherence to Pillar II rules. The directive streamlines reporting for large corporations and improves information exchange between tax authorities. DAC9 confirms the international move toward a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits for large multinational and domestic groups with annual revenues of at least EUR 750 million.<br><br>The GIR form is designed to report necessary tax information for ensuring the proper functioning of the minimum corporate income tax rate system and includes a TTIR (Supplementary Tax Information Return) format. The TTIR enables tax administrations to assess risks and accurately evaluate tax liabilities. Multinational companies can file a centralized TTIR for the entire group through the ultimate parent entity or a designated filing entity. Member states must transpose the directive into national law by December 31, 2025, with the directive taking effect on January 1, 2026, and the first information exchange occurring by June 30, 2026.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_7" style="display:none;">EUの経済財政理事会は、税務分野での国際協力を強化するため、新たな指令「DAC9」を採択しました。これは、G20/OECDが主導する国際課税ルール「第2の柱（Pillar II）」に沿った取り組みです。<br><br>この指令は、年間売上高7億5,000万ユーロ以上の多国籍企業や国内の大企業グループを対象とし、その利益に対して最低15%の実効税率を確実に適用することを目的としています。これにより、企業による過度な節税策（税源浸食や利益移転）を防ぎ、税負担の公平性を高めます。<br><br>その実現のため、2025年1月には「グローバル情報報告書（GIR）」という統一書式が導入される予定です。この報告書には、税務当局が課税リスクや納税額を正確に評価するための補足情報も含まれます。企業はこの書式を使ってグループ全体の税務情報を一括で申告でき、EU加盟国の税務当局間で情報が自動的に交換されるようになります。これにより、大企業の報告義務が簡素化されるとともに、当局間の連携が強化されます。<br><br>加盟国は2025年12月31日までにこの指令を国内法に取り入れる必要があり、2026年1月1日から施行されます。最初の情報交換は2026年6月30日までに行われる計画です。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_7" style="display:none;">欧盟经济与金融事务理事会（ECOFIN）已正式采纳DAC9指令。这项新规旨在加强欧盟成员国之间在税务管理方面的合作，为交换企业所得最低有效税率的相关信息建立了统一框架，相较于2024年10月28日的初步提案，这是一项重大进展。DAC9旨在加强税务合作，确保跨国公司及大型本土企业集团遵守税法，并与G20及经合组织（OECD）的“第二支柱”全球最低税规则相协调。<br><br>该指令的一大核心是推行标准化的“全球信息申报表（GIR）”，预计将于2025年1月发布，用以实现税务信息的自动交换。其目标在于防止税基侵蚀和利润转移，对跨国公司强制执行最低税负，并确保其遵守“第二支柱”规则。这项指令简化了大型企业的税务申报流程，并促进了各国税务机关间的信息共享。DAC9明确，年收入超过7.5亿欧元的大型跨国及本土企业集团，其利润需缴纳至少15%的有效税率，这与全球税收改革的趋势保持一致。<br><br>全球信息申报表（GIR）用于报告必要信息，以确保最低企业所得税制度的有效运作，其中包含一份补充性的税务信息申报表（TTIR）。税务部门可利用此补充申报表进行风险评估并准确计算税额。跨国公司可由其最终母公司或指定的申报实体，为整个集团统一提交一份集中的补充申报表。各成员国需在2025年12月31日前将该指令转化为本国法律。该指令将于2026年1月1日生效，首次信息交换需在2026年6月30日前完成。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_7" style="display:none;">유럽연합(EU) 경제재무이사회(ECOFIN)가 조세 분야 행정 협력 강화를 위한 새로운 지침(DAC9)을 채택했습니다. 이 지침은 G20/OECD의 '필라 2' 체계에 따라 다국적 기업 및 대규모 국내 기업 그룹에 대한 최저 유효 법인세율 관련 정보를 회원국 간에 교환하기 위한 제도입니다. 이를 통해 조세 협력을 강화하고 기업들의 규정 준수를 보장하는 것을 목표로 합니다.<br><br>DAC9 지침은 연 매출 7억 5,000만 유로 이상의 대규모 기업 그룹에 대해 15%의 최저 유효세율을 적용하는 국제적 흐름을 공식화했으며, 세원 잠식과 소득 이전을 방지하고 다국적 기업에 대한 최저한세 적용을 강제합니다.<br><br>핵심 내용은 2025년 1월 공개 예정인 표준 '글로벌 정보 보고서(GIR)' 양식의 도입으로, 이를 통해 대기업의 보고 절차를 간소화하고 과세 당국 간 정보 교환을 개선합니다. GIR 보고서에는 최저 법인세율 제도의 원활한 운영에 필요한 세무 정보가 담기며, 과세 당국이 조세 회피 위험을 평가하고 납세액을 정확히 산정할 수 있도록 돕는 '보충 세무 정보 보고서(TTIR)' 형식이 포함됩니다. 다국적 기업은 최종 모기업이나 지정된 법인을 통해 그룹 전체의 TTIR을 통합 제출할 수 있습니다.<br><br>EU 회원국은 2025년 12월 31일까지 이 지침을 국내법으로 제정해야 하며, 2026년 1월 1일부터 시행됩니다. 첫 정보 교환은 2026년 6월 30일까지 이루어질 예정입니다.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_8" style="display:none;">The Slovak Ministry of Environment is developing an Authorisation Management Module for the CBAM registry. Official applications can be submitted from March 31, 2025. Importers of goods from third countries subject to carbon border adjustment face increased legislative adjustments affecting customs processes. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) applies to specific goods entering the EU from third countries, including cement, electricity, fertilizers, iron, steel, and hydrogen, as well as materials needed for their production. It targets direct emissions from production processes and indirect emissions from electricity used during production. Exemptions include goods valued under 150 EUR and goods in travelers' personal luggage not exceeding this value.<br><br>Importers or their indirect customs representatives must apply for CBAM-approved declarant status, valid across the EU. The EU recommends early application due to a potentially lengthy approval process (up to 180 days).

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_11" style="display:none;">In early April, President Trump announced extensive tariffs on imports to the US, including a 10% base tariff on nearly all imports, a 20% tariff on EU imports (temporarily reduced to 10% until July 9, 2025), a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, and specific tariffs on Japan, South Korea, and India.

A 25% tariff could reduce the Eurozone’s GDP by 1% in 2025.

The EU is open to negotiations for zero tariffs on industrial products and is preparing retaliatory measures worth €21 billion.<br><br>The automotive, pharmaceutical, consumer goods, and film industries face significant challenges. The 100% tariff on foreign films may weaken international collaboration and disrupt capital flow. EU companies are encouraged to diversify export markets, relocate production, utilize EU trade agreements, optimize supply chains, and use customs warehouses. Consulting firms can provide support in navigating these challenges.<br><br>The US has reached its first trade agreement post-tariff implementation with the UK, focusing on strengthening collaboration in the agricultural and food industries. The agreement aims to facilitate the import of UK autos, steel, and aluminum, and the export of US beef.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_11" style="display:none;">4月初旬、トランプ大統領は米国への輸入品に対し広範な追加関税を発表しました。ほぼ全ての輸入品に10%の基本関税を課すほか、EUからの輸入品には20%（2025年7月9日までは暫定的に10%）、中国からには145%の関税を適用し、日本、韓国、インドにも個別の関税を課します。これらの措置は、国際緊急経済権限法（IEEPA）に基づき、議会の承認を経ずに発動されました。<br><br>2025年4月から5月にかけて、自動車部品に25%、外国映画に100%という追加関税も導入されました。これらの関税は、世界的な供給網の混乱や消費者物価の上昇への懸念を招いています。オランダは2025年のGDPが0.4%減少すると予測しており、EUは緊張緩和のため、500億ユーロ相当の米国製品の購入を提案しています。<br><br>この貿易戦争はEU経済、特にドイツに深刻な影響を与えています。25%の関税が課された場合、2025年のユーロ圏のGDPは1%減少する可能性があります。メルセデス・ベンツやユニリーバなどの企業は消費者心理の冷え込みや供給網の問題を報告しており、ステランティスやボルボ・カーズのように業績見通しを撤回する企業も出ています。特に、自動車産業や鉄鋼業が盛んなスロバキア、ハンガリー、チェコなどの中欧諸国は大きな打撃を受けています。<br><br>EUは、インド、英国、オーストラリアなどとの貿易協定交渉を進め、貿易関係の多角化を図っています。また、事態の悪化に備え「トランプ・タスクフォース」を設置したほか、半導体や再生可能エネルギーといった戦略的分野への投資も強化しています。EUは工業製品への関税をゼロにする交渉に前向きな姿勢を示す一方、210億ユーロ規模の報復措置も準備しています。<br><br>自動車、医薬品、消費財、映画などの業界は、大きな課題に直面しています。特に、外国映画への100%の関税は、国際的な協力関係を損ない、資本の流れを阻害する恐れがあります。EU企業に対しては、輸出先の多角化、生産拠点の移転、EUの貿易協定の活用、供給網の最適化、保税倉庫の利用などが推奨されており、専門のコンサルティング会社がこれらの課題解決を支援しています。<br><br>一方、米国は関税導入後、最初の貿易協定を英国と締結しました。この協定は、農業・食品分野での協力を強化するもので、英国製の自動車、鉄鋼、アルミニウムの輸入を円滑にし、米国産牛肉の輸出を促進することを目指しています。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_11" style="display:none;">四月初，特朗普总统宣布对美国进口商品实施大规模关税。具体措施包括：对几乎所有进口商品征收10%的基础关税；对欧盟进口商品征收20%的关税（2025年7月9日前暂定为10%）；对中国进口商品征收高达145%的关税；并对日本、韩国和印度征收特定关税。这些措施是依据《国际紧急经济权力法》实施的，从而绕过了国会审批。<br><br>此外，2025年4月和5月还将新增关税，包括对汽车零部件征收25%的关税，以及对外国电影征收100%的关税。这些措施引发了外界对全球供应链中断和消费品价格上涨的担忧。荷兰预计其2025年国内生产总值（GDP）将因此下降0.4%。为缓解紧张局势，欧盟已提议购买价值500亿欧元的美国产品。<br><br>这场贸易战对欧盟经济造成了显著冲击，尤其是德国。据估计，25%的关税可能导致2025年欧元区GDP下降1%。梅赛德斯-奔驰、联合利华等公司表示，消费者信心受挫，供应链出现问题；而Stellantis集团和沃尔沃汽车等公司则撤回了其财务预期。斯洛伐克、匈牙利、捷克等以汽车和钢铁产业为支柱的中欧国家也受到了严重影响。<br><br>为应对挑战，欧盟正积极实现贸易关系多元化，与印度、英国、澳大利亚等国进行贸易协定谈判，并成立了“特朗普工作组”以应对潜在的局势升级。同时，欧盟也在加大对半导体、可再生能源等战略性产业的投资。欧盟对就工业品零关税进行谈判持开放态度，并准备了价值210亿欧元的反制措施。<br><br>汽车、制药、消费品和电影等行业正面临严峻挑战。其中，对外国电影征收100%的关税可能削弱国际合作并扰乱资本流动。为此，欧盟鼓励企业采取多元化出口市场、转移生产基地、利用现有贸易协定、优化供应链以及使用海关保税仓等策略。专业的咨询公司能为企业应对这些挑战提供支持。<br><br>关税政策实施后，美国已与英国达成了首个贸易协议。该协议重点加强了两国在农业和食品领域的合作，旨在为英国的汽车、钢铁和铝制品进口以及美国的牛肉出口提供便利。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_11" style="display:none;">4월 초, 트럼프 대통령은 국제긴급경제권한법(IEEPA)에 따라 의회 승인 없이 미국 수입품에 대한 대규모 관세 부과를 발표했습니다. 거의 모든 수입품에 10%의 기본 관세를 부과하고, EU 수입품에는 20%(2025년 7월 9일까지 10%로 한시적 인하), 중국산 제품에는 145%의 관세를 적용하며, 일본, 한국, 인도에도 특정 관세를 부과하는 내용입니다.<br><br>2025년 4월과 5월에는 자동차 부품에 25%, 외국 영화에 100%의 추가 관세가 도입되었습니다. 이러한 조치로 글로벌 공급망이 교란되고 소비자 물가가 상승할 것이라는 우려가 커지고 있습니다. 네덜란드는 2025년 GDP가 0.4% 감소할 것으로 전망했으며, 유럽연합(EU)은 갈등 완화를 위해 500억 유로 규모의 미국 제품 구매를 제안했습니다.<br><br>이번 무역 전쟁은 EU 경제, 특히 독일에 상당한 타격을 주고 있습니다. 25%의 관세가 부과될 경우 2025년 유로존의 GDP가 1% 감소할 수 있습니다. 메르세데스-벤츠와 유니레버 같은 기업들은 소비자 신뢰 하락과 공급망 문제를 겪고 있으며, 스텔란티스와 볼보 같은 일부 기업은 실적 전망을 철회했습니다. 특히 자동차 및 철강 산업 비중이 큰 슬로바키아, 헝가리, 체코 등 중부 유럽 국가들이 큰 영향을 받고 있습니다.<br><br>EU는 인도, 영국, 호주 등과 무역 협정을 추진하며 교역 관계를 다각화하고 있으며, 상황 악화에 대비해 '트럼프 태스크포스(TF)'를 구성했습니다. 또한, 반도체와 재생에너지 등 전략 산업에 대한 투자도 확대하고 있습니다. EU는 공산품에 대한 무관세 협상에 열린 입장을 보이면서도, 210억 유로 규모의 보복 조치를 준비하고 있습니다.<br><br>자동차, 제약, 소비재, 영화 산업 등은 심각한 도전에 직면했습니다. 특히 외국 영화에 대한 100% 관세는 국제적 협력을 약화시키고 자본 흐름을 방해할 수 있습니다. 이에 EU 기업들은 수출 시장 다변화, 생산 기지 이전, EU 무역 협정 활용, 공급망 최적화, 보세창고 이용 등의 대응 방안을 모색하고 있습니다. 전문 컨설팅 기관이 이러한 과제를 해결하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있습니다.<br><br>한편, 미국은 관세 부과 이후 첫 무역 협정을 영국과 체결했습니다. 이 협정은 농업 및 식품 산업의 협력을 강화하고, 영국산 자동차, 철강, 알루미늄의 수입과 미국산 소고기의 수출을 용이하게 하는 것을 목표로 합니다.</p>

This applies to vehicle purchases, leases, and operating costs. Exceptions exist for vehicles exclusively used for business purposes like resale, rental, passenger transport, driving schools, and replacement vehicles, provided private use is negligible. This limitation is set to last from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2028, with a possible extension.<br><br>A new VAT return form will also be implemented on July 1, 2025, to accommodate changes related to VAT obligations for taxpayers submitting customs declarations for imported goods subject to self-assessment, specifically when goods are released for free circulation or placed under temporary use with partial import duty exemption. The new form separates sections for tax liability and tax deduction, including specific lines for different VAT rates and categories, such as domestic goods and services, intra-community acquisitions, and imported goods. The Financial Administration will publish the new form by the end of June 2025.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_12" style="display:none;">スロバキア財務省は、事業と私用の両方で利用される自家用車に関する付加価値税（VAT）の控除、および輸入品に関する法改正に伴うVAT申告書の様式変更について発表しました。<br><br>2025年7月1日より、事業と私用の両方で利用される乗用車（カテゴリM1、L1e、L3e）に関するVAT控除に新たな規定が適用されます。実際の事業利用と私的利用の割合にかかわらず、VAT控除額が一律で50%に制限されます。この制限は、車両の購入、リース、および維持・運営費用が対象となります。ただし、私的利用がごくわずかである場合に限り、転売、レンタル、旅客輸送、自動車教習所、代車など、事業専用で利用される車両は例外となります。この措置は2025年7月1日から2028年6月30日までの時限的なもので、延長される可能性もあります。<br><br>また、2025年7月1日より、新たなVAT申告書の様式が導入されます。これは、輸入貨物に関するVATの自己申告（リバースチャージ方式）を行う納税者のための法改正に伴う変更です。新しい申告書では、納税額を計算する欄と控除額を計算する欄が明確に分けられ、国内の物品・サービス、EU域内からの購入、輸入品といったカテゴリ別、および異なる税率ごとに専用の記入欄が設けられます。この新しい申告書様式は、財務局より2025年6月末までに公表される予定です。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_12" style="display:none;">斯洛伐克财政部宣布了两项增值税政策调整，涉及公私混用车辆的税费抵扣以及因进口商品法规变更而更新的增值税申报表。<br><br>自2025年7月1日起，对于公私混用的个人乘用车及部分摩托车，其相关的增值税抵扣将被统一限制为50%。无论实际的公私使用比例如何，这项规定都将适用于车辆的购买、租赁及日常运营开销。不过，若车辆完全用于商业经营（如用于转售、出租、载客服务、驾校教学或作为替换车辆），且私人用途可忽略不计，则不受此限制。该限制政策的有效期为2025年7月1日至2028年6月30日，并可能延期。<br><br>此外，为配合进口货物增值税法规的变动，新的增值税申报表也将于2025年7月1日启用。新表格主要针对需要自行申报进口货物增值税的纳税人，特别是当货物获准自由流通或在部分减免关税下临时入境时。新申报表将应纳税额与可抵扣税额分开，并为不同税率和类别（如国内商品与服务、欧盟内部采购、进口货物等）设置了专门的栏目，使申报更加清晰。斯洛伐克财政管理局将在2025年6月底前公布新表格的最终样式。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_12" style="display:none;">슬로바키아 재무부는 업무 및 개인 용도로 함께 사용하는 개인용 차량의 부가가치세(VAT) 공제 관련 변경 사항과 수입 상품에 대한 법률 개정에 따른 부가세 신고서 양식 개편안을 발표했습니다.<br><br>2025년 7월 1일부터, 업무와 개인 용도로 함께 사용하는 개인용 승용차(M1, L1e, L3e 유형)에 대한 부가세 매입세액 공제가 실제 사용 비율과 관계없이 일괄적으로 50%로 제한됩니다. 이 규정은 차량 구매, 리스 및 관련 유지비에 모두 적용됩니다. 다만, 재판매, 렌탈, 여객 운송, 운전 교습, 대차 서비스 등 사업 목적으로만 독점적으로 사용하고 개인적 사용이 미미한 경우는 예외로 인정됩니다. 이 제한 조치는 2025년 7월 1일부터 2028년 6월 30일까지 시행되며, 추후 연장될 수 있습니다.<br><br>또한 2025년 7월 1일부터 새로운 부가세 신고서 양식이 도입됩니다. 이는 자진신고납부 대상 수입품에 대해 세관 신고를 하는 납세자의 부가세 의무 변경 사항을 반영하기 위함으로, 특히 자유 유통 목적으로 통관되거나 부분 관세 면제 하에 일시 사용되는 물품이 해당됩니다. 새로운 신고서는 납부세액과 공제세액 항목이 분리되며, 국내 재화 및 용역, EU 역내 취득, 수입 상품 등 다양한 부가세율 및 항목별로 기재란이 구체화됩니다. 재무 관리국은 2025년 6월 말까지 새로운 신고서 양식을 공시할 예정입니다.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_14" style="display:none;">Effective from 2025, the withholding tax rate on profit distributions to Slovak resident individuals will change. This affects income paid in the 2025 tax period, which will be distributed in 2026 or later. The primary change is a decrease in the tax rate from 10% to 7%. This rate is determined solely by the year the profit distribution pertains to, impacting companies distributing profits from corporations or cooperatives.<br><br>The tax base is the gross profit distribution without expense deductions. The distributing entity is the tax payer, responsible for withholding and remitting the tax to the administrator by the 15th of the following month, using account number 500267/8180. They must also submit notification form OZNA4311v21 electronically. If the profit is distributed in installments, a separate notification is required for each month. Correct withholding and remittance exempts the profit distribution from further tax liability for the recipient, who doesn't need to declare this in their tax return. However, the company bears responsibility for accuracy.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_15" style="display:none;">The approved consolidation package introduces changes to the allocation of a portion of paid income tax, effective January 1, 2025, impacting tax returns filed for 2024. The goal is to streamline the process, enhance transparency, and reduce the administrative burden on recipients of the 2% share. A significant impact is on citizens who previously used this share as monetary compensation for parental pension provided by their working children.<br><br>The allocation of this tax share for parental pensions will be managed by the Social Insurance Agency, using data from the Financial Directorate based on declarations or tax returns. The first payment under this new system will occur in 2026, based on data from 2025. Individuals can allocate 2% of their paid income tax (minus any tax bonus), provided the recipient (parent) is a beneficiary of old-age pension, disability pension received at retirement age, or similar benefits. The tax share can be allocated to one or both parents, with equal distribution. Legal entities cannot allocate their tax share as parental pension.<br><br>The Social Insurance Agency will assess eligibility for the original parental pension according to regulations in effect until December 31, 2024, in connection with old-age pension eligibility. The law change does not affect taxpayers' right to allocate their tax share to both parents (pensioners) and the non-profit sector. Individuals can allocate 2% each to their mother and father, and an additional 2% or 3% to non-profits, potentially allocating a total of 7% of their paid tax share, with a minimum tax amount of 3 EUR for each allocation. If the share is below 3 EUR, no refund will be provided.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_15" style="display:none;">2025年1月1日より、納付済み所得税の一部を分配する制度が変更され、2024年分の確定申告から適用されます。この改正は、手続きの簡素化、透明性の向上、および2%分の分配金を受け取る側の事務負担軽減を目的としています。特に、これまでこの制度を、働く子供からの「親への年金上乗せ」として利用していた方々に大きな影響が及びます。<br><br>今後、親への年金上乗せを目的とした税金の分配は、社会保険機関が税務当局の申告データに基づいて管理します。この新制度に基づく最初の支払いは、2025年のデータに基づき2026年に行われます。個人は、納付した所得税（税額控除後）の2%を、老齢年金や退職年齢で受給する障害年金などを受給している親に分配することができます。分配は片親または両親（均等割）に対して可能ですが、法人がこの制度を利用することはできません。<br><br>なお、従来の制度に基づく親への年金上乗せの受給資格については、社会保険機関が2024年12月31日までの規定に沿って審査します。今回の法改正後も、納税者が自身の両親（年金受給者）と非営利団体の両方に税金を分配する権利は維持されます。個人は、母親と父親にそれぞれ2%ずつ、さらに非営利団体に2%（または3%）を寄付することが可能で、最大で納付税額の7%を分配できる場合があります。ただし、それぞれの分配先への寄付額は最低3ユーロ必要で、これに満たない場合は分配は行われません。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_15" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_15" style="display:none;"></p>

These rates are dependent on the length of the business trip. Employers must provide meal arrangements in advance, meaning new meal vouchers or electronic card recharges must be issued before this date. The rates are increasing as follows: for trips of 5-12 hours, the allowance rises from €8.30 to €8.80; for 12-18 hours, from €12.30 to €13.10; and for trips exceeding 18 hours, from €18.40 to €19.50. The maximum employer contribution to meals will be €4.84 (55% of €8.80), and the minimum meal voucher value will be €6.60 (75% of €8.80). The financial contribution to meals will be between €3.63 and €4.84. Employers will need to adjust travel expense calculations, update internal regulations, and inform employees about the changes. Payroll systems must be updated to reflect the new rates. This adjustment aims to better cover employee expenses during business trips due to the rising cost of living. Proper implementation is crucial for compliance with legislation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_20" style="display:none;">スロバキア労働・社会・家族省は、2025年4月1日より、従業員の出張時における食事手当の支給額を改定することを発表しました。<br><br>この改定は出張の時間に応じて適用され、支給額は以下の通り引き上げられます。<br>• 5時間～12時間の出張：8.80ユーロ（現行8.30ユーロ）<br>• 12時間～18時間の出張：13.10ユーロ（現行12.30ユーロ）<br>• 18時間を超える出張：19.50ユーロ（現行18.40ユーロ）<br><br>この改定に伴い、食事手当に関する規定も変更されます。<br>• 雇用主の最大補助額：4.84ユーロ（新基準額8.80ユーロの55%）<br>• 食事券の最低額面：6.60ユーロ（新基準額8.80ユーロの75%）<br>• 現金での食事補助額：3.63ユーロから4.84ユーロの範囲<br><br>雇用主は、施行日である2025年4月1日までに、新しい食事券の発行や電子カードへのチャージなど、食事手当の支給準備を完了させる必要があります。また、旅費精算や給与計算システムの更新、社内規定の改定、従業員への変更内容の周知といった対応が求められます。<br><br>今回の改定は、物価上昇に対応し、出張中の従業員の経済的負担を適切に補うことを目的としています。法令を遵守するため、各企業はこれらの変更を確実に実施することが重要です。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_20" style="display:none;">自2025年4月1日起，斯洛伐克将上调员工出差的餐费补贴标准。新标准根据出差时长分为三档：<br><br>•   出差5至12小时：补贴从8.30欧元上调至8.80欧元。<br>•   出差12至18小时：补贴从12.30欧元上调至13.10欧元。<br>•   出差超过18小时：补贴从18.40欧元上调至19.50欧元。<br><br>基于新的标准，最低餐券面值将为6.60欧元（8.80欧元的75%），而雇主承担的餐费部分最高为4.84欧元（8.80欧元的55%），实际补助金额将在3.63至4.84欧元之间。<br><br>为应对此项变更，公司需要提前做好准备，包括在新规生效前发放新的餐券或为电子餐卡充值。同时，公司应相应调整差旅费用核算方法，更新内部规章制度和薪资系统，并及时将相关变化告知全体员工。<br><br>此次调整旨在应对持续上涨的生活成本，更好地保障出差员工的权益。为确保合法合规，准确执行新标准至关重要。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_20" style="display:none;">슬로바키아 노동사회복지부는 2025년 4월 1일부터 적용될 새로운 직원 출장 식대 규정을 발표했습니다.<br><br>이에 따라 출장 시간에 따라 식대 지원금이 다음과 같이 인상됩니다.<br>• 5~12시간 출장: 8.80유로 (기존 8.30유로)<br>• 12~18시간 출장: 13.10유로 (기존 12.30유로)<br>• 18시간 초과 출장: 19.50유로 (기존 18.40유로)<br><br>고용주의 식대 최대 지원금은 4.84유로(8.80유로의 55%)이며, 최소 식권 가액은 6.60유로(8.80유로의 75%)로 설정됩니다.<br><br>고용주는 시행일 이전에 인상된 금액이 적용된 새로운 식권이나 충전식 식사 카드를 직원에게 지급해야 합니다. 또한, 출장비 정산 기준과 사내 규정을 개정하고, 변경 사항을 직원에게 공지해야 하며, 급여 시스템에도 인상된 수당을 반영해야 합니다.<br><br>이번 인상 조치는 물가 상승에 따라 출장 중인 직원의 실질적인 경비 부담을 줄이기 위해 마련되었으며, 관련 법규 준수를 위해 각 사업장은 변경된 내용을 정확히 적용해야 합니다.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_22" style="display:none;">In March 2025, the European Commission introduced the OMNIBUS I proposal to simplify sustainability and ESG reporting. The changes aim to reduce the number of companies subject to CSRD by approximately 80%, significantly decreasing administrative burdens while maintaining the EU's commitment to sustainability. The Commission estimates savings of €6.3 billion in annual administrative costs and the mobilization of €50 billion in public and private investment to support policy priorities.<br><br>OMNIBUS is a set of legislative amendments covering environmental regulations and sustainability disclosure requirements, promoting transparency and accountability. Key points include mandating detailed environmental and social activity reporting, harmonizing ESG disclosure rules for easier performance comparison, and extending reporting obligations to larger SMEs. These changes affect firms trading in the European market, making sustainability compliance essential for competitiveness.<br><br>Key elements of OMNIBUS I include simplified disclosure rules through standardized ESG reporting guidelines, reporting obligations for firms with over 250 employees or €40 million turnover, stricter compliance control and penalties, and a focus on ecological factors. Businesses face advantages like better transparency, improved image, and access to new markets, but also challenges such as increased compliance costs and complex adaptation to new norms. SMEs face challenges in adapting, data collection, and limited administrative capacities.<br><br>The OMNIBUS proposal simplifies the management and transparency of sustainability, requiring EU firms to prepare for new regulations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_22" style="display:none;">2025年3月、欧州委員会は、サステナビリティ（持続可能性）およびESG報告の簡素化を目的とした「オムニバスI」法案を導入しました。この変更は、CSRD（企業持続可能性報告指令）の対象企業を約80%削減することを目指しており、EUのサステナビリティへの取り組みを維持しつつ、企業の管理負担を大幅に軽減します。欧州委員会は、これにより年間63億ユーロの管理コストが削減され、政策の優先事項を支援するために500億ユーロの官民投資が動員されると見込んでいます。<br><br>オムニバス法案は、環境規制やサステナビリティ情報開示要件を包括的に改正するもので、透明性と説明責任の向上を目的としています。主な内容として、環境・社会活動に関する詳細な報告の義務化、企業間の比較を容易にするためのESG情報開示ルールの統一、そして、より規模の大きい中小企業への報告義務の拡大などが挙げられます。これらの変更は欧州市場で取引を行う企業に影響を与え、競争力を維持するためにはサステナビリティへの対応が不可欠となります。<br><br>オムニバスIの主な要素には、標準化されたESG報告ガイドラインによる情報開示ルールの簡素化、従業員250人超または売上高4,000万ユーロ超の企業への報告義務、より厳格なコンプライアンス管理と罰則、そして環境要因の重視が含まれます。企業にとっては、透明性の向上や企業イメージの改善、新規市場へのアクセスといった利点がある一方、コンプライアンス費用の増加や新基準への複雑な適応といった課題も生じます。特に中小企業は、新制度への適応、データ収集、限られた管理能力といった点で課題に直面します。<br><br>このオムニバス法案は、サステナビリティに関する管理と透明性を簡素化するものであり、EU域内の企業は新たな規制への準備が求められます。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_22" style="display:none;">2025年3月，欧盟委员会推出名为“OMNIBUS I”的一揽子提案，旨在简化可持续发展与ESG（环境、社会与公司治理）的报告流程。这些变更预计将使需要遵循《企业可持续发展报告指令》（CSRD）的公司数量减少约80%，从而在维持欧盟对可持续发展承诺的同时，大幅减轻企业的行政负担。委员会估计，此举每年可节省63亿欧元的行政成本，并能动员500亿欧元的公共及私人投资以支持相关政策。<br><br>OMNIBUS是一套涵盖环境法规和可持续发展信息披露要求的综合性立法修正案，旨在提升透明度与问责制。其要点包括：强制企业报告详细的环境与社会活动信息；统一ESG信息的披露规则，以便于各公司之间的绩效比较；以及将报告义务扩大至规模较大的中小型企业。这些变化将影响在欧洲市场运营的公司，因此，遵守可持续发展相关的规定对于保持企业竞争力至关重要。<br><br>OMNIBUS I提案的关键内容包括：通过标准化的ESG报告准则，简化信息披露规则；为员工超过250人或年营业额超过4000万欧元的公司设定报告义务；实施更严格的合规监管与处罚措施；并重点关注生态环境因素。对企业而言，这项提案带来了提升透明度、改善品牌形象、进入新市场等机遇，但同时也面临合规成本增加、适应新规过程复杂等挑战。特别是中小型企业，在适应新规、收集数据以及行政能力方面可能面临更大的困难。<br><br>总而言之，OMNIBUS提案旨在简化可持续发展事务的管理并提高其透明度，欧盟境内的企业需为此做好准备，以应对新的法规要求。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_22" style="display:none;">2025년 3월, 유럽연합(EU) 집행위원회는 지속가능성 및 ESG 정보 공개를 간소화하기 위한 ‘옴니버스 I(OMNIBUS I)’ 법안을 발표했습니다. 이 법안은 기업 지속가능성 보고지침(CSRD)의 적용 대상 기업 수를 약 80% 줄여 행정적 부담을 크게 낮추는 동시에, 지속가능성에 대한 EU의 기조를 유지하는 것을 목표로 합니다. EU 집행위원회는 이를 통해 연간 63억 유로의 행정 비용을 절감하고, 주요 정책을 지원하기 위해 500억 유로 규모의 공공 및 민간 투자를 유치할 수 있을 것으로 전망합니다.<br><br>옴니버스는 환경 규제와 지속가능성 정보 공개 의무를 포괄하는 일괄 개정 법안으로, 투명성과 책임성 강화를 목적으로 합니다. 주요 내용으로는 ▲상세한 환경·사회 활동 보고 의무화 ▲기업 간 성과 비교를 용이하게 하기 위한 ESG 정보 공개 기준 통일 ▲대규모 중소기업까지 보고 의무 확대 등이 있습니다. 이 변화는 EU 시장에서 활동하는 기업들에게 큰 영향을 미치므로, 지속가능성 규제 준수는 기업 경쟁력의 필수 요소가 될 것입니다.<br><br>옴니버스 I 법안의 핵심 요소는 다음과 같습니다. 첫째, 표준화된 ESG 보고 가이드라인을 통해 정보 공개 규칙을 간소화합니다. 둘째, 직원 수 250명 이상 또는 매출 4천만 유로 이상의 기업에 보고 의무를 부과합니다. 셋째, 규제 준수 여부에 대한 감독을 강화하고 위반 시 처벌 규정을 둡니다. 넷째, 환경적 요인을 중점적으로 관리합니다. 기업은 투명성 향상, 이미지 제고, 신규 시장 진출 기회 확보 등의 긍정적 효과를 기대할 수 있지만, 규제 준수 비용 증가나 새로운 기준에 적응해야 하는 어려움에 직면할 수도 있습니다. 특히 중소기업은 변화에 적응하고 데이터를 수집하는 데 어려움을 겪거나 행정 역량에 한계가 있을 수 있습니다.<br><br>결론적으로 옴니버스 법안은 지속가능성 관리와 투명성을 간소화하는 중요한 변화이며, EU 내 기업들은 새로운 규제에 대한 철저한 대비가 필요합니다.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_29" style="display:none;">The Slovak government has adopted an amendment to the building law, necessitating adjustments to several laws related to business and tax obligations for individuals and legal entities in Slovakia. Key changes include amendments to the Trades Licensing Act, the Law on Warehouse Receipts, the Income Tax Act, and the Law on Local Taxes.<br><br>The Trades Licensing Act now excludes authorized urban planners, control engineers, and construction supervisors from being considered trades. Using technical equipment at stalls or portable devices no longer requires a construction permit. Trade licenses for documentation and project work on simple constructions obtained before April 1, 2025, remain valid until March 31, 2029. The act also updates the list of trades and requirements for construction trades.<br><br>The Law on Warehouse Receipts mandates that warehouse keepers notify the ministry within 15 days of any changes affecting their license to operate a public warehouse. The calculation period no longer starts from the issuing date of the warehouse permit.<br><br>The Income Tax Act redefines "buildings and other structures" that are not considered buildings for depreciation purposes, specifically addressing small structures on forest lands. It also defines the depreciation of building complexes, where each structure within the complex is depreciated separately. A transitional provision states that for buildings with proceedings initiated and completed by March 31, 2025, the original regulations apply.<br><br>The Law on Local Taxes modifies the definition of a building plot for property tax calculation. It defines a building plot as one specified in a valid building permit until the occupancy permit is issued. It also specifies what is not considered a building plot. Tax obligations arising before December 31, 2025, will still follow the regulations effective until March 31, 2025. Valid building permits and occupancy permits under previous regulations are now considered decisions on construction projects and occupancy certificates, respectively.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_29" style="display:none;">スロバキア政府は建築法を改正し、それに伴い、国内の個人や法人の事業活動や税金に関する複数の法律も変更されました。<br><br>主な変更点は以下の通りです。<br><br>**事業ライセンスについて**<br>公認の都市計画家、検査技師、建設監督といった専門職は、事業ライセンス（営業許可）の取得が不要になります。また、屋台や移動販売車などで機材を使う際に、建築許可は必要なくなります。2025年4月1日より前に取得した簡易な建物の設計などに関する事業ライセンスは、2029年3月31日まで引き続き有効です。建設関連事業の対象範囲や要件も更新されました。<br><br>**倉庫業について**<br>倉庫業者は、営業許可に関わる変更があった場合、15日以内に管轄省庁へ届け出る義務が課されます。また、許可に関連する期間の計算方法も見直されました。<br><br>**所得税について**<br>税金の計算（減価償却）において、建物として扱われない建造物の定義が新しくなり、特に森林内にある小屋などが対象として明記されました。複数の建物からなる複合施設の場合、それぞれの建物を個別に減価償却するルールが定められました。なお、2025年3月末までに手続きが完了した建物については、これまでのルールが適用されます。<br><br>**地方税（固定資産税など）について**<br>固定資産税の計算基準となる「建築用地」の定義が変わります。今後は、建築許可が下りてから、建物が完成して使用許可が出るまでの間の土地が「建築用地」と見なされます。一方で、建築用地に該当しないケースも明確化されました。2025年末までに発生する納税義務については、2025年3月末までの旧ルールが適用されます。また、これまでの「建築許可」や「使用許可」は、法改正後は新しい制度上の名称に読み替えられます。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_29" style="display:none;">斯洛伐克政府通过了《建筑法》修正案，并相应调整了多项与个人及企业商业和税务相关的法规。主要修订内容涉及《贸易许可法》、《仓单法》、《所得税法》和《地方税法》。<br><br>根据新的《贸易许可法》，城市规划师、工程监理等专业人士不再被视为传统“行业”。在摊位或移动设备上使用技术设备不再需要申请施工许可。对于简单建筑工程，在2025年4月1日前获得的从业许可，有效期可延长至2029年3月31日。法案还更新了相关行业的名录和从业资质要求。<br><br>《仓单法》规定，公共仓库经营者的运营许可信息若发生任何变动，必须在15天内通知主管部门。相关期限的计算起点也不再是许可证的签发日期。<br><br>《所得税法》重新界定了在计算折旧时不被视为“建筑物”的资产类别，特别是林地上的小型构筑物。对于综合建筑群，其中每个单体建筑的折旧将独立计算。新规设有过渡期：在2025年3月31日前已启动并完成相关审批程序的建筑，仍适用旧的折旧规定。<br><br>《地方税法》修改了用于计算房产税的“建筑地块”的定义，指在获得最终入住许可前、已由有效建筑许可证指定的土地，并明确了不属于建筑地块的范围。2025年12月31日前产生的纳税义务，将继续沿用截至2025年3月31日有效的旧法规。同时，以往法规下的“建筑许可证”和“入住许可证”在新规中被分别视为“建筑项目批文”和“入住证明”。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_29" style="display:none;">슬로바키아 정부가 건축법을 개정함에 따라, 개인 및 법인의 사업 활동과 납세 의무 관련 법규들도 함께 변경됩니다. 주요 변경 내용은 사업면허법, 창고증권법, 소득세법, 지방세법에 관한 것입니다.<br><br>사업면허법 개정으로 공인 도시계획가, 감리 기술자, 건설 감리사와 같은 직업은 이제 사업면허가 필요한 업종에서 제외됩니다. 또한, 가판대나 이동식 장비에 기술 장비를 사용할 때 더 이상 건축 허가가 필요하지 않게 됩니다. 2025년 4월 1일 이전에 취득한 단순 건축물의 서류 및 설계 작업 관련 사업 면허는 2029년 3월 31일까지 유효합니다. 이 외에도 건설 관련 업종 목록과 자격 요건이 업데이트되었습니다.<br><br>창고증권법에 따라, 공공 창고 운영자는 운영 허가에 영향을 미치는 변경 사항이 발생할 경우 15일 이내에 관련 부처에 신고해야 합니다. 신고 기간을 계산할 때 더는 창고 허가서 발급일을 기준으로 하지 않습니다.<br><br>소득세법에서는 감가상각 대상에서 제외되는 건물의 정의가 바뀌었으며, 특히 산림지에 있는 소규모 구조물이 이에 해당합니다. 복합 건물의 경우, 각 건물을 개별적으로 감가상각하도록 정의되었습니다. 2025년 3월 31일까지 관련 절차가 시작되고 완료된 건물에 대해서는 기존 규정이 그대로 적용됩니다.<br><br>지방세법에서는 재산세 계산의 기준이 되는 건축 부지의 정의가 변경됩니다. 이제 건축 부지란, 유효한 건축 허가를 받은 후 사용 승인을 받기 전까지의 토지를 의미하며, 건축 부지로 간주되지 않는 경우도 구체적으로 명시되었습니다. 2025년 12월 31일 이전에 발생한 납세 의무는 2025년 3월 31일까지 유효한 기존 규정을 따릅니다. 기존 법에 따라 발급된 건축 허가와 사용 승인은 각각 새로운 법의 '건설 프로젝트 결정서'와 '사용 증명서'로 간주됩니다.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_30" style="display:none;">Slovakia has amended its law on the minimum tax level, also known as the equalization tax, to address several contentious areas in the initial transposition. The amendment, which modifies Act No. 507/2023, clarifies definitions, supplements rules for calculating excluded income based on economic substance, and introduces simplified calculations for insignificant entities (state and non-profit entities).<br><br>Key changes include adjustments to definitions of "included tax of a basic entity," "qualified imputation tax," "unqualified refundable imputation tax," and "marketable minimum price." The definition of "parent entity" has also been refined, distinguishing between "non-excluded main parent entity," "intermediate parent entity," and "partially owned parent entity." The amendment further elaborates on rules for income inclusion, under-taxed profits, and domestic equalization taxes.<br><br>The new law significantly alters the calculation of eligible income or loss, allowing for the inclusion of profits or losses determined according to acceptable financial standards if the basic entity's financial statements are prepared accordingly, information is reliable, and permanent differences exceed EUR 1,000,000. It also provides guidance on the treatment of currency gains and adjustments to included taxes. Tax credits are addressed, and rules for excluding income based on economic substance have been expanded to cover tangible asset rentals, dependent activities, and income from tangible assets. Hybrid measures aimed at preventing tax avoidance are introduced, and exceptions for simplified calculations are outlined for entities meeting specific criteria. The effective dates for determining eligible income or loss and applying deferred tax assets have been postponed to January 1, 2025.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_30" style="display:none;">スロバキアは、最低税率（調整税）に関する法令を改正しました。この改正は、当初の法制度化において問題となっていた複数の点を解消することを目的としています。改正法（法律第507/2023号を修正）では、各種定義の明確化、経済的実体に基づく除外所得の計算ルールの補足、および特定の事業体（国や非営利団体など）を対象とした計算の簡素化が導入されました。<br><br>主な変更点として、「構成事業体の対象租税」「適格インピュテーション税」といった専門用語の定義が調整されました。また、「親会社」の定義も、「非除外最終親会社」「中間親会社」「部分所有親会社」に区別されるなど、より具体的に見直されています。さらに、所得の合算、軽課税所得、国内調整税に関するルールも詳細化されました。<br><br>今回の改正では、対象となる所得や損失の計算方法が大幅に変更されます。具体的には、企業の財務諸表が国際的に認められた会計基準に準拠しており、その情報に信頼性があり、かつ会計上の永久差異が100万ユーロを超える場合には、当該会計基準に基づいた利益や損失を計算に含めることが可能になります。その他、為替差損益の取り扱いや、対象租税の調整に関する指針も示されました。税額控除にも言及されているほか、経済的実体に基づく所得除外のルールは、有形資産の賃貸や、それに付随する活動、有形資産から生じる所得も対象となるよう拡充されています。<br><br>また、租税回避を防止するためのハイブリッド措置が導入され、特定の要件を満たす事業者向けに、計算を簡素化できる例外規定も設けられました。なお、対象所得・損失の算定や繰延税金資産の適用に関する規定の施行日は、2025年1月1日に延期されています。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_30" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_30" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_31" style="display:none;">Several legal amendments concerning counter-terrorism financing, asylum, and health insurance were enacted in late 2024 in Slovakia.<br><br>Amendments to the law against money laundering focus on strengthening the legal framework against illegal financial flows, improving prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, and enhancing international cooperation. Key changes include stricter requirements for businesses, especially financial institutions, in identifying clients and monitoring suspicious transactions, with increased attention to cryptocurrency transactions, trusts, partnerships, individuals from high-risk countries, life insurance beneficiaries, ultimate beneficial owners, and clients of pan-European pension products. New rules impose obligations on cryptocurrency platforms for thorough checks and transparency. Penalties for illegal activities are increased, and international cooperation is emphasized.<br><br>Amendments to the law on the residence of foreigners and asylum aim to streamline temporary refuge status and asylum policy in line with EU standards. They focus on optimizing administrative procedures, improving conditions for asylum seekers, and strengthening their rights. Key changes include adjusted conditions for long-term residence, new conditions for work and study stays, increased monitoring of foreigners' residence, and simplified procedures for third-country nationals, introducing electronic application submissions for residence-related matters, with the caveat that biometric data must already be on file. The asylum law amendments focus on streamlining asylum proceedings, increasing protection for asylum seekers' rights, improving processes for repeated asylum applications, and introducing new rules for children and families.<br><br>Finally, changes to health insurance stipulate public health insurance will cease under specific conditions (no general practitioner, no healthcare provided/claimed/communicated within 5 years, no change in provider within 5 years), and that state will pay for health insurance in cases where a person is engaged in community service. It also amended the law on health insurance companies, for which economically eligible costs are defined, and the term technical reserve is replaced by the term cost of insurance benefits.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_31" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_31" style="display:none;">2024年底，斯洛伐克颁布了涉及反恐融资、庇护及健康保险领域的多项法律修正案。<br><br>在反洗钱方面，修正案旨在加强打击非法资金流动的法律框架，改进对洗钱和恐怖主义融资的预防措施，并深化国际合作。主要变化包括：对企业（特别是金融机构）在客户身份识别和可疑交易监控方面提出了更严格的要求，并特别加强了对加密货币交易、信托基金、合伙企业、高风险国家个人、人寿保险受益人、最终受益人及泛欧养老金产品客户的审查。新规要求加密货币平台履行更严格的核查和透明度义务，同时加大了对违法行为的处罚力度，并强调了国际合作的重要性。<br><br>在外籍人士居留与庇护方面，修正案旨在根据欧盟标准，优化临时庇护身份和难民政策。其重点在于简化行政流程，改善寻求庇护者的生活条件并保障其权利。主要变化包括：调整了长期居留、工作和学习的条件，加强了对外国人的居留监控，并简化了第三国公民的申请程序。新法案引入了在线提交居留相关申请的功能，但前提是申请人的生物识别信息数据必须已有存档。庇护法的修订则致力于简化审批流程，更好地保护申请人权利，完善重复申请的处理机制，并为儿童和家庭制定了新规。<br><br>最后，在健康保险方面，法案规定在特定情况下（如五年内没有指定的家庭医生、未曾使用或申报医疗服务、未更换过保险公司），公共健康保险将被终止。同时，国家将为从事社区服务的人员支付健康保险费用。此外，法案还修订了与健康保险公司相关的法律，界定了“经济合格成本”的范围，并用“保险赔付成本”一词取代了“技术准备金”这一术语。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_31" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_32" style="display:none;">Several legislative changes are set to impact the business environment in Slovakia, effective primarily from January 1, 2025.<br><br>Amendments to the VAT Act include new conditions for mandatory VAT registration, such as supplying buildings or building parts, supplying goods via electronic interfaces to non-taxable individuals within the EU, and acquiring goods from other member states with an established permanent establishment in Slovakia. The basis for VAT calculation is also redefined. It will be based on the purchase price of the goods or the cost of the service at the time of supply.

For example, improper use of the cash register now carries a fine of €500-€15,000.<br><br>Amendments to the Business Act prohibit legal entities with unscrupulous beneficial owners from engaging in real estate brokerage and accounting services. Companies must adjust legal relationships with final beneficiaries by April 15, 2025. The act also reduces administrative burdens by allowing state institutions to electronically exchange information already provided by entrepreneurs.<br><br>The Customs Act increases fines for customs offenses.<br><br>Finally, there are amendments to the Act on the Implementation of International Sanctions, detailing the responsibilities of state administration employees. The Act on Financial Administration is also amended, granting financial authorities the right to control cash transfers across borders shared with other member states exceeding €10,000, and to seize the entire amount if information is withheld. Fines for failing to declare cash transfers above this limit will also apply.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_32" style="display:none;">2025年1月1日より、スロバキアの事業環境に影響を与える、以下の重要な法改正が施行されます。<br><br>**付加価値税（VAT）法の改正**<br>新たにVATの納税義務者となる条件が追加されます。具体的には、建物の売買、オンラインでのEU域内個人への商品販売、スロバキア国内に事業拠点を持つ場合の他国からの商品仕入れなどが対象となります。VATの計算基準も見直され、今後は商品やサービスの提供時点での仕入れ価格やコストが基準となります。また、投資用資産のVAT調整期間は、約3,320ユーロを超える動産は5年、建物は20年と定められます。<br><br>**電子レジスター法の改正**<br>違反時の罰則が大幅に強化され、例えばレジの不適切な使用には500〜15,000ユーロの罰金が科されるようになります。<br><br>**事業法の改正**<br>実質的支配者（会社の最終的な所有者）に問題があると判断された法人は、不動産仲介業や会計サービス業を営むことができなくなります。各企業は、2025年4月15日までに実質的支配者に関する情報を整備し、法的な関係を明確にする必要があります。また、事業者が一度提出した情報を各行政機関が電子的に共有できるようになり、手続きの負担が軽減されます。<br><br>**関税法の改正**<br>関税関連の違反に対する罰金が引き上げられます。<br><br>**その他の改正**<br>国際制裁の実施に関する法律も改正され、行政職員の責任範囲がより明確になります。また、財務行政法も改正され、EU加盟国との国境を越える1万ユーロ超の現金の持ち運びについて、財務当局が管理する権限を持つようになります。情報の提供を拒んだ場合、その全額が没収される可能性があり、この金額を超える現金の持ち運びを申告しなかった場合にも罰金が科されます。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_32" style="display:none;">斯洛伐克多项新法规将于2025年1月1日起生效，对当地的商业环境将产生重要影响。<br><br>增值税法修正案：<br>强制注册增值税增加了新的条件，包括：销售建筑或其部分；通过电商平台向欧盟境内的个人消费者销售商品；以及在斯洛伐克设有常设机构并从其他欧盟成员国采购商品。增值税的计税基础也发生变化，将以商品供应时的采购价或服务成本为准。投资资产的增值税抵扣调整期也做出明确规定：价值超过3,319.39欧元的可动产为5年，建筑及相关构筑物为20年。<br><br>电子收银机法案：<br>大幅提高了违规罚款金额。例如，不当使用收银机的罚款将从500欧元起，最高可达15,000欧元。<br><br>商业法案修正案：<br>禁止由存在不良记录的最终受益人所控制的公司从事房地产中介和会计服务。相关公司须在2025年4月15日前完成与最终受益人法律关系的调整。此外，为减轻企业行政负担，政府机构之间将可以电子化共享企业已提交的信息。<br><br>海关法：<br>提高了对海关违规行为的罚款力度。<br><br>其他法案修订：<br>关于执行国际制裁的法案明确了政府雇员的相关职责。财务管理法案修正后，授权金融管理部门监管在与其他欧盟成员国边境超过1万欧元的现金转移。若当事人隐瞒信息，监管部门有权没收全部款项，未按规定申报也将面临罚款。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_32" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_33" style="display:none;">Extensive discussions regarding the content and interpretation of the new financial transaction tax led to pressure on lawmakers and the need for revisions to the law. Before Law No. 279/2024 Coll. on the financial transaction tax took effect, an amendment was approved in late November 2024.<br><br>The amendment clarifies definitions, specifying that cash deposits to payment accounts, issuing payment instruments, money transfers, and payment initiation services are not financial transactions. It also refines the definition of a transaction account, limiting it to accounts used by entrepreneurs, and clarifies who is considered a taxpayer, including payment service users with a registered office or business establishment in Slovakia.<br><br>The amendment expands the list of exempt entities to include organizations like Matica slovenská, the Slovak Academy of Sciences, civic associations, churches, and regional tourism organizations. These entities must notify the tax collector (payment service provider) that they are not taxpayers. The definition of the tax payer also includes payment service users and providers without a local organizational unit.<br><br>The range of tax-exempt transactions is also broadened to encompass activities related to crypto-assets, payment operations performed by postal companies, automated balance compensation within consolidated groups, transactions involving funds under bankruptcy or execution proceedings, auction deposits, payments by state funds, payments of administrative and court fees, transactions by public universities and transactions of supervised financial market actors conducted on behalf of their clients. Furthermore, transactions for healthcare insurance, medicine, prepayments, and sanctions are also exempted.<br><br>Finally, the calculation of the tax base for re-invoiced costs is specified, and the tax rate of 0.4% (max. 40 EUR) applies to financial transactions debited from the taxpayer's account, financial transactions that relate to the domestic activities of the taxpayer and which another person invoiced to him and the amount of the re-invoiced costs related to the implementation of a financial transaction, which relates to the domestic activity of the taxpayer. The amendments take effect on January 1, 2025.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_33" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_33" style="display:none;">围绕一项新的金融交易税法案，其内容与解释引发了广泛讨论，给立法者带来了压力，并促使法案进行修订。在该法案（第 279/2024 Coll. 号）正式生效前，一项修正案已于2024年11月下旬获批。<br><br>此次修正案首先澄清了关键定义，明确指出向支付账户存入现金、发行支付工具、转账及支付发起服务均不属于金融交易。同时，法案将“交易账户”的范围限定为企业经营者使用的账户，并明确了纳税人身份，涵盖了在斯洛伐克有注册地或营业机构的支付服务用户，以及没有本地分支机构的支付服务用户和提供商。<br><br>修正案扩大了免税实体的范围，新增了斯洛伐克文化协会（Matica slovenská）、斯洛伐克科学院、公民协会、教会以及地区旅游组织等。这些机构需主动告知其支付服务提供商（即代收税款方）其免税资格。<br><br>免税交易的类型也得到扩展，涵盖了加密资产相关活动、邮政公司处理的支付业务、企业集团内部的自动轧差结算、涉及破产或强制执行程序中资金的交易、拍卖保证金、国家基金的付款、行政及司法规费的缴纳、公立大学的交易、受监管的金融机构代客户进行的交易，以及用于医疗保险、药品、预付款和制裁的款项。<br><br>最后，修正案明确了“转开票成本”的计税基础，并规定0.4%的税率（单笔上限40欧元）适用于从纳税人账户扣款的金融交易、与纳税人国内业务相关且由第三方开票的金融交易，以及由此类交易产生的转开票成本。<br><br>所有修正条款将于2025年1月1日正式生效。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_33" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_35" style="display:none;">The European Parliament adopted the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) to combat deforestation, forest degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. This regulation aims to control the import, export, and marketing of specific products linked to environmental damage.<br><br>The EUDR applies to all EU companies involved in importing or exporting designated products. Non-compliance results in a ban on trading these products. The regulation focuses on commodities like cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soy, and wood, and products derived from them. The specific list is in Annex I of the regulation.<br><br>The EUDR places obligations on economic operators (importers, exporters, domestic producers) and traders. They are prohibited from placing or making available on the market commodities and products that caused deforestation or forest degradation, are not compliant with the laws of the country of production, and are not covered by a due diligence statement. Economic operators must exercise due diligence, issue a due diligence statement, communicate within the supply chain, and large companies must publish annual due diligence reports.<br><br>Due diligence involves gathering information, assessing risks (considering factors like country risk level, deforestation rates, and supply chain complexity), and implementing risk mitigation measures. Wood products with a valid FLEGT license are deemed compliant.<br><br>Small and medium-sized enterprises have lighter obligations, only needing to collect information on suppliers and customers. A representative can be appointed for microenterprises. Failure to comply can result in penalties, including fines of up to 4% of the company's annual EU turnover.<br><br>The EUDR came into force on June 29, 2023, and will be applied from December 2024, but there is a proposition to postpone the date to December 2025 for large companies and June 2026 for microenterprises and small businesses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_35" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_35" style="display:none;">欧洲议会通过了《欧盟零毁林法案》（EUDR），旨在通过管控特定商品的贸易来遏制全球森林砍伐和退化，并减少温室气体排放。<br><br>该法案规定，任何在欧盟市场进口、出口或销售特定商品的公司都必须遵守。这些商品主要包括牛、可可、咖啡、棕榈油、橡胶、大豆、木材及其衍生品（如皮革、巧克力、家具等）。不符合规定的商品将被禁止在欧盟市场交易。<br><br>法案要求相关企业（包括进口商、出口商和贸易商）承担尽职调查的义务，确保其产品满足三个核心条件：未导致森林砍伐或退化、符合生产国的法律法规、并且附有完整的尽职调查声明。<br><br>尽职调查流程包括收集产品来源信息、评估供应链中的毁林风险（例如，考虑原产国的风险等级和毁林情况），并采取措施降低风险。企业必须出具尽职调查声明，大型企业还需每年发布报告。此外，持有特定合规许可证（如FLEGT）的木材产品可被视为符合要求。<br><br>中小企业的合规义务相对简化，而微型企业可以指定授权代表来处理相关事务。违规企业将面临严厉处罚，罚款最高可达其在欧盟年营业额的4%。<br><br>该法案于2023年6月生效，原计划从2024年12月起全面实施。目前有提案建议将大型企业的实施日期推迟至2025年12月，中小微企业则推迟至2026年6月。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_35" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_38" style="display:none;">The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation introduces a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-asset markets across the EU. In Slovakia, Law No. 248/2024 implements MiCA, effective November 1, 2024, addressing crypto-asset custody, advisory services, information obligations, supervision by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS), sanctions, activity restrictions, and blocking online interfaces. The NBS will oversee compliance from June 30, 2024, focusing on licensed entities, although non-supervised entities can operate until June 30, 2026.<br><br>MiCA distinguishes between electronic money tokens (EMTs), asset-referenced tokens (ARTs), and other crypto-assets. Banks or electronic money institutions can offer EMTs from June 30, 2024, after notifying the NBS and submitting a whitepaper. Banks or NBS-licensed entities can offer ARTs from the same date. Other crypto-assets can be offered by legal entities submitting a whitepaper to the NBS from December 30, 2024.<br><br>Amendments to income tax and accounting laws, effective January 1, 2025, address crypto-asset taxation. Issues remain regarding the uniform treatment of diverse crypto-assets. Electronic money tokens are now treated as standard currencies for accounting valuation. Taxable income for individuals from crypto-asset exchanges is subject to 19% or 25% income tax and 15% health insurance contribution. Corporations must record crypto-assets as intangible assets, with taxable income calculated as the difference between purchase and sale prices. Investing in crypto-assets via securities like ETFs may provide income tax exemptions for individuals. Since 2024, detailed reporting of crypto transactions is mandatory.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_38" style="display:none;">暗号資産市場規制（MiCA）は、EU全域の暗号資産市場に統一的な規制の枠組みを導入するものです。スロバキアでは、法律第248/2024号によりMiCAが導入され、2024年11月1日から施行されます。この法律は、暗号資産の保管や助言サービス、情報開示義務、スロバキア国立銀行（NBS）による監督、制裁措置、活動制限、オンラインサービスのブロックといった項目を定めています。NBSは2024年6月30日から法令遵守の監督を開始し、当初は認可を受けた事業者が対象ですが、未登録の事業者も2026年6月30日までは事業を継続できます。<br><br>MiCAでは、暗号資産を「電子マネートークン（EMT）」、「資産参照トークン（ART）」、「その他の暗号資産」の3種類に分類しています。銀行や電子マネー機関は、2024年6月30日以降、NBSへの届出とホワイトペーパー（事業計画書）の提出を行えば、EMTを提供できます。ARTについては、銀行やNBSから認可を受けた事業者が同日から提供可能です。その他の暗号資産は、法人が2024年12月30日以降にNBSへホワイトペーパーを提出すれば提供できるようになります。<br><br>2025年1月1日から施行される所得税法と会計法の改正により、暗号資産に関する税制が整備されます。ただし、多種多様な暗号資産をどのように一律に扱うかという課題は残されています。会計上、電子マネートークンは法定通貨と同様に扱われます。個人が暗号資産の取引で得た利益には、19%または25%の所得税と15%の健康保険料が課されます。法人の場合、暗号資産は無形資産として計上され、売買差益が課税対象となります。ETF（上場投資信託）のような証券を通じて暗号資産に投資する場合、個人の所得税が免除される可能性があります。2024年からは、暗号資産取引に関する詳細な報告が義務付けられています。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_38" style="display:none;">欧盟的《加密资产市场法规》(MiCA) 为整个地区的加密资产市场建立了一套统一的监管框架。斯洛伐克通过第 248/2024 号法案来实施 MiCA 法规，该法案将于2024年11月1日生效。新法规涵盖了加密资产的托管、咨询服务、信息披露义务、斯洛伐克国家银行 (NBS) 的监管职责、制裁措施、业务活动限制以及对非法在线平台的封锁。斯洛伐克国家银行将从2024年6月30日起开始监督市场合规情况，监管重点是持牌机构。不过，对于尚未获得许可的现有机构，法规给予了宽限期，允许其运营至2026年6月30日。<br><br>MiCA 法规将加密资产分为三类：电子货币代币 (EMT)、资产参考代币 (ART) 以及其他类型的加密资产。从2024年6月30日起，银行或电子货币机构在向国家银行报备并提交白皮书后，即可发行电子货币代币。同日起，银行或获得国家银行许可的机构也可以发行资产参考代币。从2024年12月30日起，任何法人实体在向国家银行提交白皮书后，便可提供其他类型的加密资产。<br><br>自2025年1月1日起生效的所得税和会计法修正案，对加密资产的税务处理做出了规定，但如何统一处理种类繁多的加密资产仍是待解决的问题。在会计处理上，电子货币代币已被视同标准货币进行估值。个人通过加密资产交易获得的收益，需缴纳19%或25%的所得税以及15%的健康保险费。企业则必须将持有的加密资产记为无形资产，其应税收入按买卖差价计算。对于个人投资者，通过交易所交易基金 (ETF) 等证券形式投资加密资产，可能享受所得税豁免。此外，自2024年起，所有加密货币交易都必须进行详细的强制性申报。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_38" style="display:none;">유럽연합(EU)의 암호자산 시장 규제(MiCA)는 EU 전역에 걸쳐 통일된 암호자산 규제 체계를 도입하는 것을 목표로 합니다. 슬로바키아에서는 2024년 11월 1일부터 관련 법률(제248/2024호)이 시행됨에 따라 MiCA 규정이 본격적으로 적용됩니다. 이 법은 암호자산의 보관, 자문 서비스, 정보 제공 의무, 슬로바키아 국립은행(NBS)의 감독 권한, 제재, 사업 활동 제한, 불법 온라인 사이트 차단 등의 내용을 포함합니다. NBS는 2024년 6월 30일부터 인가받은 기업을 중심으로 규제 준수 여부를 감독하며, 기존 사업자는 2026년 6월 30일까지 유예 기간을 적용받아 사업을 계속할 수 있습니다.<br><br>MiCA 규정은 암호자산을 전자화폐 토큰(EMT), 자산준거 토큰(ART), 그리고 그 외 기타 암호자산으로 구분합니다. 2024년 6월 30일부터 은행이나 전자화폐 기관은 NBS에 신고하고 관련 백서를 제출하면 전자화폐 토큰을 발행할 수 있습니다. 자산준거 토큰 역시 같은 날부터 은행이나 NBS의 인가를 받은 기관이 발행할 수 있습니다. 그 외 다른 암호자산은 2024년 12월 30일부터 법인이 NBS에 백서를 제출한 후 시장에 제공할 수 있게 됩니다.<br><br>2025년 1월 1일부터는 암호자산 과세에 대한 소득세법 및 회계법 개정안도 시행됩니다. 다만, 다양한 종류의 암호자산을 동일하게 취급하는 문제에 대해서는 여전히 과제가 남아있습니다. 회계상 전자화폐 토큰은 이제 일반 화폐와 동일하게 평가됩니다. 개인의 경우, 암호자산 거래로 발생한 소득에 대해 19% 또는 25%의 소득세와 15%의 건강보험료가 부과됩니다. 법인은 암호자산을 무형자산으로 기록해야 하며, 과세 소득은 매매 차익으로 계산됩니다. ETF와 같은 증권을 통해 암호자산에 투자할 경우, 개인은 소득세 비과세 혜택을 받을 수도 있습니다. 2024년부터는 모든 암호자산 거래 내역을 상세히 신고해야 합니다.</p>

EU member states are expected to transpose the directive into national law by July 26, 2026, with phased implementation based on company size and turnover.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_40" style="display:none;">欧州議会は、企業の持続可能性デュー・ディリジェンス（CSDD）に関する指令を採択しました。これは、EU域内で活動する企業に対し、事業が社会や環境に与える影響への責任を求めるものです。企業は、自社の事業活動およびサプライチェーン全体における人権侵害や環境破壊、ガバナンス上の問題といった負の影響を特定し、防止・是正する義務を負います。<br><br>この指令の対象となるのは、従業員1,000人超かつ全世界での売上高が4億5,000万ユーロ超のEU企業、およびEU域内での売上高が4億5,000万ユーロ超のEU域外企業です。また、特定の基準を満たすフランチャイズ契約やライセンス契約を締結している企業も含まれます。<br><br>対象企業には、デュー・ディリジェンスを企業方針に組み込み、事業が与える影響を評価し、負の影響を防止・軽減するための措置を講じることが義務付けられます。さらに、被害の救済措置、ステークホルダーとの対話、苦情処理制度の設置、デュー・ディリジェンスの実効性の監視、そして取り組みに関する情報公開も必要です。子会社は、親会社と連携し、デュー・ディリジェンス方針を遵守して適切な対策を実施する必要があります。<br><br>課題としては、管理体制の構築、社内規定の整備、データの正確性の確保、役員報酬とサステナビリティ目標との連動などが挙げられます。一方、メリットとしては、持続可能な経済の実現、リスク評価の高度化、評判リスクの低減、資金調達の円滑化などが期待されます。EU加盟国は、2026年7月26日までに本指令を国内法化し、その後、企業の規模や売上高に応じて段階的に適用が開始される見込みです。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_40" style="display:none;">欧洲议会通过了《企业可持续发展尽职调查指令》（CSDD），旨在要求在欧盟运营的企业对其社会和环境影响承担责任。企业必须识别、预防并减轻其自身运营及供应链中可能对人权、环境及善治产生的负面影响。<br><br>该指令的适用范围包括：员工超过1000人、全球营业额超4.5亿欧元的欧盟公司；在欧盟境内营业额超4.5亿欧元的非欧盟公司；以及符合特定标准的特许经营或授权模式下的公司。<br><br>企业需将尽职调查融入公司政策，具体措施包括：评估潜在风险、采取措施预防和减轻负面影响、提供补救方案、与利益相关方进行沟通、建立申诉渠道、监督尽职调查的成效，并向公众披露相关信息。子公司也需与母公司合作，共同遵守并执行尽职调查的相关政策与措施。<br><br>企业在实施过程中面临的挑战包括建立有效的内部控制体系、调整管理制度、确保数据的准确性，以及将高管薪酬与可持续发展目标挂钩。而该指令带来的益处则在于推动可持续经济发展、提升企业的风险管理能力、降低声誉受损的风险，并有助于拓宽融资渠道。<br><br>欧盟各成员国需在2026年7月26日前将该指令转化为本国法律，并根据企业的规模和营业额分阶段推行。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_40" style="display:none;">유럽 의회는 EU 내 기업이 사회와 환경에 미치는 영향에 책임을 지도록 하는 '기업 지속가능성 실사 지침(CSDD)'을 채택했습니다. 기업은 자사의 운영 및 공급망 전반에서 인권, 환경, 지배구조에 미치는 부정적 영향을 파악하고 해결해야 합니다.<br><br>이 지침은 직원 1,000명 및 전 세계 매출 4억 5천만 유로를 초과하는 EU 기업과 EU 내 매출이 4억 5천만 유로를 넘는 역외 기업에 적용됩니다. 특정 요건을 충족하는 프랜차이즈 또는 라이선스 계약을 맺은 기업도 포함됩니다.<br><br>기업은 실사 의무를 정책에 통합하고, 부정적 영향을 평가·예방·완화하며, 피해 구제를 보장하고, 이해관계자와 소통하며 고충처리 절차를 마련해야 합니다. 또한 실사 과정의 효과를 지속적으로 점검하고 그 결과를 대외에 공개해야 합니다. 자회사는 모회사와 협력하여 실사 정책을 준수하고 관련 조치를 이행해야 합니다.<br><br>지침 이행을 위해서는 내부 통제 시스템 구축, 관련 규정 정비, 데이터 정확성 확보, 경영진 성과 보상을 지속가능성 목표와 연계하는 등의 과제가 있습니다. 반면, 지침 준수를 통해 지속가능한 경제를 구축하고 기업의 리스크 관리 능력을 개선하며, 평판 위험을 줄이고 자금 조달 기회를 확대하는 긍정적 효과도 기대됩니다. EU 회원국들은 2026년 7월 26일까지 이 지침을 자국법에 반영해야 하며, 이후 기업 규모와 매출에 따라 단계적으로 시행됩니다.</p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_41" style="display:none;">The Slovak government has approved amendments to excise duties and introduced a new tax on sweetened beverages, effective January 1, 2025. This tax targets businesses making the first supply of sweetened non-alcoholic drinks containing added sugar or sweeteners in Slovakia. Affected beverages include packaged sweetened non-alcoholic drinks (flavored mineral waters, juices, colas, sweetened non-alcoholic beer, iced coffees, teas), packaged concentrates (syrups, instant and powdered drinks), and energy drinks with over 150mg of caffeine per liter. Exemptions exist for sweetened drinks in medicine form, nutritional supplements, infant formula, and food for specific medical purposes. Tax rates vary: €0.15/liter for packaged drinks, €0.30/liter for high-caffeine drinks, and €1.05/liter or €4.30/kg for concentrates (€2.10/liter or €8.60/kg for high-caffeine concentrates). A rule addresses pre-tax stockpiling for entities audited by auditors, requiring monitoring of acquired sweetened beverage quantities from July to December 2024.<br><br>The excise duty law on tobacco products has also been amended, expanding the range of taxable products to include raw tobacco, smokeless tobacco products, related products, nicotine products and pouches, heated tobacco, and smokeless alternatives (e-cigarettes). These products will require mandatory control markings. Smokeless tobacco products are defined, and their tax base is determined by the quantity of filling in kilograms (for inhalable products) or grams (for non-inhalable products). Specific regulations govern the distribution of smokeless tobacco, requiring permits in certain situations. "Related tobacco products" now encompass e-cigarette refills, nicotine pouches, and other nicotine products. Their sale below the tax amount is prohibited, and they must be marked with "ITV" before sale. Excise duty rates for tobacco products have increased significantly, effective November 1, 2024, with further changes planned for February 2025 and January 2026. However, these future changes may be reconsidered depending on the need for continued fiscal consolidation. The government anticipates expanding excise duties to new tobacco products in the future.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_41" style="display:none;">スロバキア政府は、2025年1月1日より、物品税の改正を承認し、新たに加糖飲料税を導入します。この税は、砂糖や甘味料を加えた非アルコール飲料をスロバキア国内で最初に出荷する事業者が課税対象となります。対象となるのは、容器入りの加糖飲料（フレーバーウォーター、ジュース、コーラ、甘味料入りノンアルコールビール、アイスコーヒー、紅茶など）、濃縮タイプの飲料（シロップ、粉末飲料など）、およびカフェイン含有量が1リットルあたり150mgを超えるエナジードリンクです。医薬品、栄養補助食品、乳児用ミルク、特別医療目的食品は課税対象外となります。税率は、容器入り飲料が1リットルあたり0.15ユーロ、高カフェイン飲料が0.30ユーロ、濃縮タイプは液体で1.05ユーロ/リットル、粉末で4.30ユーロ/kg（高カフェインの場合はそれぞれ2.10ユーロ、8.60ユーロ）となります。また、新税導入前の駆け込み購入を防ぐため、監査を受ける企業を対象に、2024年7月から12月までの加糖飲料の仕入れ量を監視する規定も設けられます。<br><br>たばこ製品に関する物品税法も改正され、課税対象が拡大されます。新たに対象となるのは、生たばこ、無煙たばこ製品、関連製品、ニコチン製品およびニコチンパウチ、加熱式たばこ、電子たばこなどの無煙代替品です。これらの製品には管理用の表示が義務付けられます。無煙たばこ製品の定義が明確化され、税額は内容物の重量（吸引用はキログラム単位、非吸引用はグラム単位）に基づいて決定されます。また、特定の状況下では、無煙たばこの流通に許可が必要となります。「関連たばこ製品」には、電子たばこのリキッド、ニコチンパウチ、その他のニコチン製品が含まれるようになります。これらの製品は税額を下回る価格での販売が禁止され、販売前に「ITV」という印を表示する必要があります。たばこ製品の物品税率は2024年11月1日に大幅に引き上げられ、さらに2025年2月と2026年1月にも変更が予定されています。ただし、これらの将来の税率変更は、今後の財政健全化の必要性に応じて見直される可能性があります。政府は、将来的にはさらに新しいたばこ製品へ物品税を拡大することも見込んでいます。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_41" style="display:none;">斯洛伐克政府已批准消费税修正案，并新增含糖饮料税，将于2025年1月1日起生效。这项新税主要针对在斯洛伐克境内首次供应含有添加糖或甜味剂的非酒精饮料的商家。<br><br>受影响的饮料类别包括：包装好的含糖非酒精饮料（如风味矿泉水、果汁、可乐、无醇甜啤酒、冰咖啡、茶等）、包装好的浓缩品（如糖浆、速溶和粉末饮料），以及每升咖啡因含量超过150毫克的能量饮料。药品形式的含糖饮料、营养补充剂、婴儿配方奶粉以及特殊医疗用途食品可豁免此税。税率设定如下：包装饮料为每升0.15欧元，高咖啡因饮料为每升0.30欧元；浓缩品为每升1.05欧元或每公斤4.30欧元（高咖啡因浓缩品则为每升2.10欧元或每公斤8.60欧元）。为防止在新税生效前囤积，法案规定，接受审计的实体需监控其在2024年7月至12月期间采购的含糖饮料数量。<br><br>此外，烟草制品消费税法也进行了修订，扩大了征税范围，将生烟草、无烟烟草制品及其相关产品、尼古丁产品及尼古丁袋、加热烟草以及电子烟等无烟替代品均纳入其中。这些产品将强制要求贴上管控标识。法案对无烟烟草制品进行了定义，其计税基础按重量（吸入式产品按公斤，非吸入式产品按克）计算。法案还对无烟烟草的分销做出了具体规定，特定情况下需获得许可。<br><br>“烟草相关产品”的范围现已扩大，包括电子烟补充液、尼古丁袋及其他尼古丁产品。这些产品禁止以低于税额的价格销售，且销售前必须贴上“ITV”标识。烟草制品的消费税率自2024年11月1日起已大幅提高，并计划在2025年2月和2026年1月进一步调整。不过，未来的税率调整将视持续财政整顿的需求而定。政府预计未来还会将新型烟草产品纳入消费税征收范围。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_41" style="display:none;">슬로바키아 정부가 소비세법 개정안을 승인함에 따라 2025년 1월 1일부터 가당음료에 대한 새로운 세금, 이른바 '설탕세'가 도입됩니다. 이 세금은 슬로바키아 내에서 설탕이나 인공 감미료가 첨가된 비알코올 음료를 처음으로 제조하거나 유통하는 사업자에게 부과됩니다.<br><br>과세 대상은 가향 광천수, 주스, 콜라, 가당 무알코올 맥주, 아이스 커피, 아이스티 등 포장된 가당 비알코올 음료와 시럽, 분말 형태의 농축액, 그리고 리터당 카페인 함량이 150mg을 초과하는 에너지 드링크 등입니다. 다만, 의약품 형태의 음료, 영양 보충제, 영유아용 조제분유 및 특수 의료용 식품은 과세 대상에서 제외됩니다.<br><br>세율은 일반 포장 음료는 리터당 0.15유로, 고카페인 음료는 리터당 0.30유로이며, 농축액의 경우 리터당 1.05유로 또는 kg당 4.30유로가 부과됩니다. 고카페인 농축액은 세율이 리터당 2.10유로 또는 kg당 8.60유로로 더 높습니다. 또한, 세금 부과 전 음료 사재기를 방지하기 위해 외부 감사를 받는 기업은 2024년 7월부터 12월까지의 가당음료 매입량을 의무적으로 관리해야 합니다.<br><br>한편, 담배 제품에 대한 소비세법도 개정되어 과세 대상이 대폭 확대되었습니다. 기존 담배 제품 외에 생담뱃잎, 무연 담배, 니코틴 파우치, 궐련형 전자담배 및 액상형 전자담배 등 니코틴을 함유한 대체 제품들이 모두 과세 대상에 포함되며, 이들 제품에는 납세필증 부착이 의무화됩니다.<br><br>특히 전자담배 액상, 니코틴 파우치 등 '유사 담배 제품'은 세액보다 낮은 가격으로 판매하는 것이 금지되며, 판매 전 'ITV'라는 표기를 부착해야 합니다. 담배 제품에 대한 소비세율은 2024년 11월 1일부터 인상되며, 2025년 2월과 2026년 1월에 추가 인상이 예정되어 있습니다. 다만, 향후 세율 조정은 정부의 재정 건전화 필요성에 따라 재검토될 수 있습니다. 정부는 앞으로도 새로운 형태의 담배 제품에 소비세를 계속 확대해 나갈 방침입니다.</p>

Taxable transactions include transfers from a business account, card payments, and re-invoiced costs related to business activities in Slovakia. Exempt transactions include receipts of funds, tax and social security payments, reversed payments, securities management, government bond purchases, foreign exchange operations, and intra-bank transfers.<br><br>The tax rate is 0.4% (max €40) for cashless transfers and 0.8% for cash withdrawals, plus €2 per card payment, and 0.4% for re-invoiced costs with a minimum tax of €0.01. The tax period is monthly, with the first payment due in April 2025. Banks calculate and remit the tax monthly, submitting reports to the tax authority. Businesses must use a dedicated transaction account and can request clarification on tax calculations within 12 months. The transaction tax is tax-deductible for businesses. Starting in 2025 businesses that are required to use a cash register will also be required to accept cashless payments.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_45" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_45" style="display:none;">斯洛伐克将于2025年起征收一项新的金融交易税，旨在增加国家预算收入。具体内容如下：<br><br>**征税对象**<br>*   适用于斯洛伐克境内的所有商业实体，无论规模或类型，包括公司、银行、医疗机构、金融服务商、宗教组织及个体经营者。<br>*   社会保险机构、国家预算组织、地方政府以及普通公民的非商业交易不在此税收范围。<br>*   税款由银行等金融服务提供商负责代扣代缴。<br><br>**征税范围**<br>*   **应税交易：** 从商业账户发起的转账、银行卡支付、直接借记、信贷操作、汇款，以及与在斯洛伐克商业活动相关的转开票据成本等支付服务。<br>*   **免税交易：** 资金收款、缴纳税款和社保、交易冲正、证券管理、购买政府债券、外汇操作以及同一银行内的账户互转。<br><br>**税率标准**<br>*   **无现金转账：** 0.4%，单笔最高40欧元。<br>*   **现金提取：** 0.8%。<br>*   **银行卡支付：** 每笔固定支付2欧元。<br>*   **转开票据成本：** 0.4%，最低税额0.01欧元。<br><br>**征管及其他规定**<br>*   **生效时间：** 2025年起，首次付款期限为2025年4月。<br>*   **纳税周期：** 按月申报。银行负责每月计算、代扣并向税务机关申报缴纳。<br>*   **企业责任：** 企业须使用专用交易账户进行商业活动。企业可在12个月内对税款计算申请澄清。该交易税可作为企业所得税的税前扣除项。<br>*   **配套政策：** 自2025年起，按规定必须使用收银机的商家，也必须接受无现金支付方式。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_45" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_47" style="display:none;">The Slovak Parliament has enacted changes to the Labor Code, impacting employee benefits and subcontractor liability. Effective January 1, 2025, employees can transfer recreation contribution rights (formerly known as recreation vouchers) to their parents, including a parent's spouse, even if the employee doesn't accompany them. This aims to boost domestic tourism and aid parents with lower incomes. Employers should update internal regulations accordingly, considering GDPR when verifying family status.<br><br>Furthermore, a new amendment, effective August 1, 2024, addresses subcontractor liability to ensure employees receive proper wages. This change, primarily concerning construction work, allows employees of subcontractors to claim unpaid wages up to the minimum wage from the main service provider if their direct employer fails to pay. The claim must be made in writing within six months of the wage due date. The service provider has 30 days to pay upon receiving the claim. The service provider can refuse payment if they can demonstrate they exercised due diligence in selecting the subcontractor and had no reason to foresee wage non-payment, considering factors like the agreed price, overlapping management, lack of illegal employment violations, and financial stability of the subcontractor. Each case will be assessed individually.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_47" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_47" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_47" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_53" style="display:none;">The Slovak Financial Directorate has published information regarding the exemption of income from the sale of shares and business shares according to § 13c of the Income Tax Act. This provision can be applied, under certain conditions, to selected legal entities or permanent establishments of taxpayers with limited tax liability located in Slovakia.<br><br>The exemption applies to the sale of shares by shareholders of joint-stock companies (including similar rights for shareholders of simple joint-stock companies) and business shares of partners in limited liability companies or limited partners in limited partnerships (including similar foreign companies), and tax residents of legal entities and permanent establishments of foreign legal entities in Slovakia. Only income from the sale of shares or business shares owned by a tax resident or a permanent establishment in Slovakia is exempt. Membership rights in cooperatives and business shares in foreign companies when a taxpayer moves abroad are specifically excluded from the exemption.<br><br>To qualify for the exemption, several tests must be met concurrently: a time test (income from the sale must be realized at least 24 months after acquiring a minimum share), a minimum shareholding test (holding at least 10% of the share capital), and a functions and risks test (performing essential functions, managing risks, and having the necessary resources). The exemption does not apply to securities dealers, sellers in liquidation, the sale of treasury shares or sales during restructuring.<br><br>The day of acquisition of the direct share is crucial and varies depending on whether it involves cash or non-cash contributions, purchase, donation, inheritance, business combinations, company transformations, or relocation of the company's registered office to Slovakia. Costs related to the acquisition of shares or business shares are not considered tax-deductible expenses in the tax period of the sale, but this is adjusted in the tax return.<br><br>The information doesn’t fully address the practical implications for holding companies, particularly regarding the functions and risks test, where holding companies often only receive passive income and delegate operational activities and risks to subsidiaries. This can make it difficult for holding companies to qualify for the exemption. Common reasons for the tax administrator rejecting the exemption for holding companies include a lack of defined business risk, extensive material and personnel support, proof of tax residency, and consideration of specific functions and risks appropriate to a holding structure.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_53" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_53" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_53" style="display:none;"></p>

For temporary residence permits for employment, employers must request confirmation of a vacant position 20 days after reporting it. The labor office will decide on granting permission within 15 working days. Applicants have 90 days to apply for residency and can start working immediately upon submitting a complete application. The residency decision time is reduced from 90 to 60 days, and electronic document submission is now allowed.<br><br>Changing the purpose of residence from employment to entrepreneurship is only possible after 12 months. Students must complete their studies before applying for a change of purpose, otherwise it will not be allowed. National visa applications can be submitted at relevant institutions or external service providers. Visas for residency applications will include information about the type of residence and the employer. National visas for business purposes are no longer obtainable.<br><br>The requirements for the EU Blue Card are eased, lowering the required salary to 1.2 times the average salary or the average salary for recent graduates. The minimum contract length is reduced to six months. ICT managers can substitute education with skills certificates, and regulated professions require qualification recognition. Blue Card holders can now engage in business or be unemployed for six months after holding the card for over two years.<br><br>Further changes include requirements for renewing temporary business residence permits, defining reasons for denying entry or stay, increased police powers to detain foreigners, and the implementation of ETIAS in mid-2025. Knowledge of Slovak at the A2 level will be required for long-term residency from July 15, 2025.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_58" style="display:none;">The Slovak Financial Administration has updated its guidelines regarding the process of granting deferrals for tax payments or payment in installments, including the calculation of interest on the deferred amount. These guidelines apply to all types of tax payments, including penalties and tax arrears, but not to tax prepayments.<br><br>To be eligible for a tax deferral or installment plan (excluding highly reliable taxpayers), the taxpayer must demonstrate that paying the tax would endanger their ability to meet their family support obligations, their income has decreased making payment difficult, payment would lead to insolvency, or there are other serious reasons preventing payment. The tax administrator can grant deferrals or installment plans for up to two years, meaning a rejected applicant must wait two years before reapplying.<br><br>The process requires submitting a complete application electronically, proposing an installment plan based on the taxpayer's financial situation, and paying an administrative fee (either €7 or €14 depending on the form of submission). The tax administrator may also require collateral for the debt. Deferrals are granted for a maximum of 24 months from the original due date.<br><br>Interest is calculated on the deferred amount at a rate based on the National Bank of Slovakia's reference rate (currently 4.11%) plus 1%, but if the reference rate is 3% or lower, a fixed rate of 3% applies. The interest is calculated daily for the actual deferral period and is payable within 15 days of the decision becoming final.

This addresses double taxation relief and combats tax abuse.<br><br>Currently, EU member states tax dividends and bond interest paid to foreign investors, while their countries of residence also tax these incomes.

Member states will automate the issuance of these certificates within 14 days of application.<br><br>The directive allows member states to use either a relief-at-source system, applying the appropriate tax rate at payment, or a quick refund system, guaranteeing tax overpayment refunds within a set timeframe. These accelerated procedures are mandatory for publicly traded share dividends. However, member states can maintain existing procedures if they provide a comprehensive relief-at-source system for publicly traded share dividends and their market capitalization share is below 1.5%.<br><br>Standardized reporting obligations are established for financial intermediaries, facilitating the detection of potential tax fraud. A national register of certified financial intermediaries will be created and linked to a European portal. Intermediaries must report transaction information to tax authorities, subject to national penalties for non-compliance.<br><br>The directive's transposition deadline is December 31, 2028, with national rules applying from January 1, 2030.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_60" style="display:none;">In late May 2024, the EU Council adopted a package of new Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules stemming from Directive (EU) 2015/849. This shifts private sector rules to a new regulation, while a directive addresses the organization of national AML authorities. The harmonized Directive 2024/1640 protects the EU financial system and promotes security and economic growth. Directive 2024/1620 establishes a supervisory authority for AML activities.<br><br>The new regulation aims to harmonize AML rules across the EU, preventing exploitation of differing national standards. It adapts to technological innovations like virtual currencies, global terrorism, and criminal ingenuity. The rules will apply three years after their July 10, 2024, effective date, allowing member states time for transposition.<br><br>The regulation sets requirements for credit and financial institutions, and designated non-financial businesses like cryptocurrency providers, luxury goods dealers, and potentially professional football clubs and agents. Cryptocurrency providers must conduct customer verification and report suspicious transactions. Dealers in precious metals, gems, luxury cars, and artwork also face verification and reporting obligations.<br><br>The regulation clarifies beneficial ownership, focusing on those who truly control or benefit from a legal entity, setting a 25% ownership threshold. It addresses multi-layered ownership structures and data protection. Cash payments will be capped at €10,000 EU-wide, with member states able to set lower limits. Enhanced due diligence is required for transactions involving high-risk third countries.<br><br>A new EU Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA) will directly and indirectly supervise high-risk financial sector entities. AMLA will oversee risky institutions, support the non-financial sector, coordinate financial intelligence units, and impose penalties. It will impose fines for breaches of AML rules, with penalties based on the benefit gained from the breach or a percentage of annual turnover. AMLA will be located in Frankfurt, Germany, with institutional operations beginning in mid-2025. A Slovakian law is being amended to transpose the Directive, expected to take effect in December 2024.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_60" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_60" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_60" style="display:none;"></p>

Effective June 1, 2024, the amendment aligns with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), ensuring consistent reporting and external auditing of sustainability information.<br><br>Subsidiaries with foreign parent companies must now prepare reports on the sustainability impacts of their business strategies. These reports, part of the annual report, must include auditor verification and disclose both short-term and long-term plans to mitigate global warming and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Key information is categorized into environmental (climate mitigation, adaptation, resources), social and human rights (equal opportunities, working conditions), and administrative factors (governance, ethics).<br><br>The first reporting period begins after January 1, 2024, for banks, insurers, and securities issuers, and after January 1, 2025, for other entities meeting at least two of these criteria: total assets exceeding €25 million, net turnover exceeding €50 million, or an average of over 250 employees. Simplified rules will apply to other companies in the future. Exemptions apply to subsidiaries included in consolidated sustainability reports compliant with CSRD and ESRS, even if the parent company is outside the EU. Recent EU directives adjusting company size criteria may narrow the scope of CSRD reporting. The assessment of companies into specific size groups will first be applied for the accounting period ending December 31, 2023.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_61" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_61" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_61" style="display:none;"></p>

It also introduces changes regarding self-assessment for VAT on imports by Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs).<br><br>Under the amendment, VAT payers can self-assess import VAT if they are established in Slovakia or another EU member state, have a VAT ID, hold AEO status, and use the imported goods exclusively for domestic economic activities. If a foreign VAT payer uses indirect representation for imports via centralized customs clearance, the declarant must also have AEO status.<br><br>Eligible VAT payers must self-calculate import VAT and file a VAT return in the tax period when the tax liability arises, with the relevant tax office as the administrator. They can deduct the VAT according to general VAT deduction rules, resulting in a neutral financial impact. Failure to meet the conditions results in a penalty of 1.3% of the VAT amount that would have been levied by customs.<br><br>If the conditions for self-assessment are not met, standard customs procedures apply. The VAT payer must submit an import declaration electronically to the customs office, which will notify the VAT amount due. Payment is due within 10 days. Failure to submit the declaration triggers a 10-day warning; non-compliance leads to fines ranging from €1,000 to €10,000, depending on the delay. Foreign entities without activated electronic mailboxes must appoint a delivery representative with one.<br><br>These changes apply to imports where the tax liability arises from January 1, 2025.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_63" style="display:none;">The Slovak government has approved amendments to the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act No. 222/2004 Z. z., effective gradually from 2024 to 2026. These changes stem from public finance consolidation measures, the Act No. 530/2023 Z. z. on the Transformation of Commercial Companies and Cooperatives, and the transposition of Council Directive (EU) 2020/285 regarding special arrangements for small businesses.<br><br>In 2024, the VAT rate on restaurant and catering services is clarified: the reduced 10% rate applies to non-alcoholic beverages, while alcoholic beverages exceeding 0.5% alcohol content are subject to the standard 20% rate. New rules regarding the transformation of commercial companies and cooperatives affect VAT payer status, requiring notification to the tax office within ten days of becoming a payer due to asset transfers. These rules also apply to foreign entities under certain conditions. Exceptions exist for transfers not considered supply of goods/services, such as the sale of a business. Selected payment service providers must provide records upon tax office request. Conditions for VAT reduction for registered social enterprises are simplified. Exemptions for services supplied to members are restricted to specific organizations.<br><br>From 2025, changes include a new VAT payer threshold of EUR 50,000 per calendar year, with exceptions for specific circumstances. Rules are specified for foreign entities and their permanent establishments. The application process and consequences of delayed registration are modified. New definitions related to small businesses are introduced, affecting VAT exemptions. These definitions cover annual turnover in Slovakia and the EU. Special rules apply to domestic and foreign small businesses. The definition of supply of goods during leasing and the place of supply for certain services are also amended. Documentary requirements for VAT deductions are relaxed and the limit for e-cash documents and tanking automats that can serve as invoices decreases to 400 EUR.<br><br>In 2026, self-assessment for goods imported after December 31, 2024, with tax liability after June 30, 2025, will be applicable to VAT payers established in Slovakia with an approved economic operator status. Starting January 1, 2026, self-assessment will extend to all VAT payers using centralized customs procedures with an approved economic operator status.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_63" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_63" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_63" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_64" style="display:none;">**Changes in Virtual Currency Taxation and Minimum Wage in Slovakia (2024)**<br><br>Effective January 1, 2024, Slovak tax law changes the treatment of virtual currencies. A virtual currency is defined as a digital store of value not issued or guaranteed by a central bank, not necessarily tied to legal tender, and accepted as a means of payment. The law also defines stablecoins and staking.<br><br>Crucially, exchanging one virtual currency for another is no longer considered a taxable sale; only exchanges for stablecoins trigger taxation. Profits from virtual currency sales within one year of acquisition or exchanges for stablecoins are taxed at 19% or 25%, depending on income level. Sales after one year are taxed at a special 7% rate. Income from mining or staking is taxed upon the sale of the acquired currency. A €2,400 exemption applies to income from exchanging virtual currency for goods or services.<br><br>The minimum monthly wage in Slovakia rises to €750 on January 1, 2024, impacting standard work hours. Consequently, minimum wage levels for different job complexity tiers increase, as do supplements for weekend, night, and holiday work. Weekend work supplement is €2.155, night work is €1.724, and work on Sundays is €4.31 per hour.<br><br>Meal allowance rates also increased, with a minimum meal voucher value of €5.85 and a maximum of €7.80. Employer contributions also see a rise.<br><br>Finally, a new law on corporate transformations, effective March 1, 2024, introduces new terminology for mergers and divisions. A key change is the introduction of "spin-offs," allowing partial asset transfers without dissolving the original company. Cross-border mergers and divisions are also addressed, with effectiveness determined by the relevant EU member state's laws.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_64" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_64" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_64" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_65" style="display:none;">**Introduction**<br><br>The globally integrated economy necessitates addressing the taxation of multinational corporations earning income across various countries. International organizations are advocating for a unified approach to ensure equal treatment under tax laws across all nations. This involves establishing a collectively agreed-upon fair tax rate, irrespective of the multinational group involved, which participating countries would respect.<br><br>Slovakia has adopted this common approach by transposing Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523, which aims to guarantee a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups within the EU, into its tax legislation.<br><br>The directive utilizes OECD Model Rules and accompanying documents for its methodological framework, aiming to ensure companies pay a fair share of taxes, whether part of a domestic group within one country or a multinational group across several.<br><br>These rules involve determining fair taxation for multinational groups or large domestic enterprises, allowing participating countries to opt for either mandatory provisions, covering income inclusion and undertaxed profits, or voluntary provisions, incorporating a top-up tax into national law. These rules align with international reporting standards that require country-by-country reporting for cumulative revenues exceeding EUR 750 million. As Slovakia hosts mainly subsidiaries of international groups rather than domestic parent companies, it has implemented a voluntary provision transposing a global top-up tax.<br><br>Slovakia has enacted Law No. 507/2023 on the Top-Up Tax to ensure a minimum taxation level for entities within its territory belonging to multinational or large domestic groups. This law covers payment and collection of the top-up tax within Slovakia, affecting groups with consolidated revenues of at least EUR 750 million in at least two of the four accounting periods immediately preceding the analysed accounting period, plus joint ventures and entities affiliated with joint ventures.<br><br>The domestic top-up tax rate aligns with the global minimum taxation level of 15%.<br><br>Entities covered by the law must determine if their effective tax rate is at least 15%. The effective tax rate is calculated as the ratio of included taxes (including deferred tax, withholding tax, or special levies) to profit/loss in a jurisdiction, adjusted for specific items. If multiple entities from the same group are in Slovakia, the effective tax rate is calculated jointly for all. If the effective rate is below 15%, a top-up tax is calculated and paid.<br><br>A company whose effective tax rate falls below 15% must notify the relevant tax office electronically, providing information to determine the top-up tax by 15 months after the end of the tax period. This deadline is extended for transitional years. If the main parent entity in another country applies mandatory provisions and settles the top-up tax there, Slovak entities must notify the tax office of the country's details where taxation occurred.<br><br>If a Slovakia company is the main parent to a group, it is responsible for ensuring the global top-up tax is assessed and paid globally.<br><br>The entity tasked with taxation in Slovakia must file a tax return within 15 months of the designated tax period's end and pay the top-up tax. Tax returns are filed electronically.<br><br>Penalties range from EUR 1,500 to EUR 50,000 for non-compliance with notification requirements.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_65" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_65" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_65" style="display:none;"></p>

This change aims to discourage tax subjects from moving abroad. Simultaneously, the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic is reviewing the inclusion of contractual penalties and similar payments in the VAT base, emphasizing that amounts paid under contractual terms related to goods or services should be considered part of the taxable base, regardless of their designation. Interest on late payments and compensation for damaged goods are exceptions. Furthermore, the VAT treatment of financial contributions from landlords to tenants, such as "free rent" periods or "fit-out" contributions, requires careful assessment to determine if they constitute taxable supplies. Finally, a new law on the transformation of commercial companies and cooperatives, effective June 28, 2023, transposes EU Directive 2019/2121, introducing new terminology and procedures for cross-border conversions, mergers, divisions, and changes of legal form, aiming to streamline company mobility and enhance protection for stakeholders.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_74" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_74" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_74" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_78" style="display:none;">**Income Tax Act**<br><br>The Income Tax Act (§ 33) allows taxpayers with taxable income under § 5 or § 6, sections 1 and 2 to claim a tax bonus for each dependent child living in their household. As of January 1, 2023, the bonus increases to €50 monthly for children over 15 and €100 monthly for children under 15, except when the child receives a subsidy for meal support.<br><br>A temporary change increases the bonus to €50 for dependents over 18 and €140 for those under 18, valid from January 2023 to December 2024, excluding cases with meal support subsidies. The bonus is capped based on a percentage of the income tax base: 20% for one child, up to 55% for six or more.<br><br>The Act introduces a "safe harbor" for transfer pricing by defining a significant controlled transaction as one exceeding €10,000, reducing administrative burden. The financial administration will use the median of independent comparable values. Related party definitions are also updated, including close relatives. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines are incorporated into Slovak law. Bilateral and multilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) can be issued for over five tax periods if agreed. Taxpayers can submit transfer pricing documentation in any foreign language, with a 15-day Slovak translation upon request. Rules for determining the tax base of a permanent establishment of a Slovak non-resident are revised to align with OECD standards. The act also includes changes related to interest expense limitations, preventative restructuring, insurance pricing, registration adjustments, and the taxation of corporate bond yields.<br><br>**VAT Act**<br><br>The VAT Act (§ 53b) requires customers (debtors) to correct deducted VAT if they haven't paid for goods or services 100 days after the due date. Debtors can re-deduct the corrected VAT upon payment. This applies only to cases where the supplier pays the tax (§ 69, section 1), not reverse charge situations. The Act introduces a presumption for the latest possible delivery date of correction documents.<br><br>For irrecoverable debts (§25a), a debt is deemed irrecoverable if unpaid 150 days after the due date, meeting conditions based on value (above or below €1,000 including VAT). Rules regarding low-value debts (under €300) are removed.<br><br>The Act removes mandatory VAT registration for entities with a turnover of €49,790 solely from exempt activities (§ 37-39). These entities can request deregistration. A reduced VAT rate of 10% applies from January 1 to March 31, 2023, to certain gastronomy, sports services, and passenger transport via cable cars and ski lifts.<br><br>**Accounting Act**<br><br>The Accounting Act (§ 21) requires final parent companies with consolidated revenues exceeding €750 million in each of the two previous accounting periods to prepare a report with income tax information. A standalone accounting unit should do the same if its revenues exceeded €750,000,000. These reports must be filed in the commercial registry, excluding entities exclusively tax resident in Slovakia or those publishing annual reports according to the Banking Act. Auditors must include information regarding the income tax report according to (§ 21a or § 21b) in the auditor's report. Also, the auditor´s report is required for legal entities which has received over 35.000 eur of tax payment shares.<br><br>**Act on International Assistance and Cooperation in Tax Administration**<br><br>DAC7 mandates digital platforms like Airbnb and Uber to report customer information to the financial administration, starting in January 2023, without being prompted. Reporting occurs annually, with the first report due by January 31, 2024, for the 2023 period.<br><br>**Commercial Code**<br><br>Amendments to the Commercial Code alter the effective date of transferring a majority share in a company, eliminating legal distinctions between majority and minority share transfers. The registry entry now confirms an existing legal state. The requirement to provide tax administrator consent for transferring majority shares if either transferor or transferee appears on the tax debtor list is removed.<br><br>**Minimum Wage Act**<br><br>The minimum wage, effective January 1, 2023, is set at €700 per month or €4.023 per hour.<br><br>**Travel Expense Act**<br><br>As of January 1, 2023, meal allowance rates for business trips increase to €6.80 (5-12 hours), €10.10 (12-18 hours), and €15.30 (over 18 hours).

Accompanying this is an updated Guideline from the Ministry of Finance, defining the content and scope of transfer pricing documentation.<br><br>Key changes include a new definition of a "significant controlled transaction," set at €10,000, aiming to reduce administrative burden for low-value transactions. The tax authorities will use the median of independent comparable values if pricing is inconsistent with the arm's length principle, although taxpayers can argue for adjustments within the independent range. The definition of related parties is expanded to include close relatives and their shareholdings, aggregating to at least 25%.<br><br>The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines are now formally incorporated into Slovak law, bolstering legal certainty. Bilateral and multilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) can now extend beyond five tax periods, subject to agreement between treaty states. Taxpayers can submit transfer pricing documentation in any foreign language, with tax authorities retaining the right to request Slovak translations within 15 days.<br><br>The amendment also adjusts the determination of taxable income for permanent establishments of non-residents in Slovakia, aligning with OECD principles, particularly regarding expenses demonstrably incurred. Foreign taxpayers can assess the tax base as the difference between income and expenses attributable to the permanent establishment, not solely on a cash basis.<br><br>The updated Guideline incorporates the concept of "significant controlled transactions," reducing the number of taxpayers required to prepare transfer pricing documentation, especially in simplified form. Documentation is not required for insignificant transactions (under €10,000) if the taxpayer doesn't report a tax loss, doesn't apply a tax loss deduction, or applies a 15% tax rate. Full tax return filings suffice for documentation in these cases. Increased documentation requirements persist for those claiming tax relief, transacting with related parties in non-cooperative states, or seeking APAs. The guideline is applicable for tax periods starting after December 31, 2022.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_80" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_80" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_80" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_81" style="display:none;">According to the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic, the amendment aims to "strengthen and support a favorable environment for the development of social entrepreneurship." It also introduces a definition of family businesses, emphasizing the preservation of family ties, values, and traditions.<br><br>The amendment to the Act on Social Economy and Social Enterprises introduces the first legislative definition of a family business in Slovakia: a business company, cooperative, or natural person – entrepreneur, provided it meets specific legal conditions, particularly the existence of ties between several family members and the business.<br><br>The law specifies three types of family businesses: Registered Family Business, Recorded Family Business and Family Farm.<br><br>A Recorded Family Business is entitled to use the designation "family business" or the abbreviation "r. p." in writing and can apply to have the designation "family business" entered in the Commercial Register.<br><br>A Registered Family Business is obliged to use at least 12% of its profit after tax to strengthen its internal and external relations within one year from the date of approval of the financial statements showing a positive result for the accounting period, primarily for education, pension provision, recreation, healthcare, and social assistance for family members and employees. They are required to use the designation "registered family business" or the abbreviation "r. r. p." in writing, also to register the designation “registered family business” into the Commercial Register. Failure to fulfill these obligations may result in fines.<br><br>While the effort to define family business concepts is positive, the amended law lacks specific forms of support for family businesses, attempting to align them with social enterprises. While preserving family ties is important, family businesses are primarily about profit. The amendment is perceived as more "family" than "business." Family businesses need assistance in succession planning, inheritance law reform, tax benefits, preferential employment conditions for family members, and easier access to financing. Defining family businesses in other laws, such as those concerning income tax and commercial and civil codes, is considered more important.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_81" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_81" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_81" style="display:none;"></p>

Digital platforms are defined as any software or electronic interface connecting sellers and buyers, including those facilitating sales, rentals, or service provisions.<br><br>The reporting requirements apply to both platform operators established and not established in Slovakia, with specific criteria defining each.

The first reporting period is the 2023 calendar year, with information due by January 31, 2024. Exceptions exist for operators who have already reported information through another platform. Operators must also notify authorities of their chosen reporting member state and register if not established in any member state.<br><br>The law outlines verification procedures for collecting information on sellers and imposes penalties for non-compliance. Fines range from €3,000 for failing to report, €5,000 for failing to register, and up to €10,000 for non-compliance with information reporting and verification procedures. Repeated offenses after warnings can result in further penalties. Platform operators must assess their obligations and prepare for compliance to avoid sanctions, potentially implementing processes in advance.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_87" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_87" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_87" style="display:none;"></p>

This may also impact your transfer pricing.<br><br>Companies experienced fluctuations in revenues and cash flows during the pandemic and faced forced closures. Conversely, some segments and companies significantly strengthened. Many countries intervened and provided subsidies to domestic firms to protect local economies and maintain jobs.

The Financial Administration expects that the analysis of the data will allow it to more effectively combat tax evasion and possible tax fraud. The data obtained will also be used to assess the need for legislative and non-legislative changes in the area of transfer pricing and their possible impacts.<br><br>ÚVHS is one of the institutions of the Financial Administration, which was established in 2019 by transforming the Tax Office for Selected Tax Subjects. Its remit includes: banks or branches of foreign banks, insurance and reinsurance companies and branches of foreign insurance and reinsurance companies, securities dealers, pension management companies or supplementary pension companies, payment institutions, entities with the status of approved economic entity, taxpayers who have achieved an annual turnover of EUR 40 million or more for each of two consecutive tax periods.<br><br>This growing trend can also be observed based on statistical data on tax audits from the Financial Administration Open Data portal. In 2021, a total of 46 tax audits focused on transfer pricing in international taxation were completed, of which more than 75% ended with a finding (35). The total amount of the finding (in EUR) in 2021 exceeded EUR 46 million, which represents an average finding of more than EUR 1.3 million per completed tax audit.<br><br>--<br><br>If you have more questions or need advice in the area of transfer pricing, please contact us at any time.

The OECD issued guidance addressing how the pandemic affects transfer pricing, particularly concerning data comparability and government support. Companies should update comparability analyses, quantify the pandemic's impact, and analyze state aid effects on operations and transfer pricing. Updating functional and risk profiles and considering loss allocation within groups is essential, especially when facing significant losses or new risks. Slovakian Financial Administration increases scrutiny on transfer pricing, focusing on potential tax evasion. They are surveying taxpayers regarding transactions with related parties. Audits related to transfer pricing are on the rise, with substantial tax findings. Businesses should seek expert advice, with offered services include transfer pricing methodology setup, documentation, comparability analysis, and representation during tax audits.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_89" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_89" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_89" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_90" style="display:none;">Employing family members is a key aspect of generational transitions in family businesses, often influenced by emotions. While having relatives on the payroll can be beneficial with a well-defined system and strong family relationships, it can also be a burden. It's crucial to differentiate between family and work relationships, as they operate on different principles. Treating a family member's misconduct differently than an employee's is essential.<br><br>Founders must avoid letting familial devotion overshadow rational business decisions, such as prematurely granting high positions to inexperienced relatives. For the business's sake, founders must detach from family ties while remaining open to changes brought by the new generation.<br><br>Recent legislative changes offer some flexibility in employing relatives. From a tax perspective, the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic issued guidelines stipulating that dependent activity is not generally considered a controlled transaction, regardless of whether it is performed by an employee, partner, or executive.<br><br>Also, relatives assisting in a family business without an employment contract may not pose a problem. Since 2020, relatives of the sole shareholder of a limited liability company are not considered illegal workers if they are pension insured, pensioners, or students under 26.

A new section, § 17k, addresses this.<br><br>Until 2023, Slovakia had an exception, limiting interest expense restrictions under § 21a to related parties only. The new § 17k applies to all interest expenses, including bank interest. If net interest expenses exceed €3,000,000, the tax base increases by the amount exceeding 30% of the tax base plus net interest expenses and depreciation (EBITDA). Net interest expenses are the difference between deductible interest expenses and taxable interest income.<br><br>Unlike § 21a, capitalized interest is included. § 21a clarifies that it doesn't apply to capitalized interest. A new paragraph stipulates that low capitalization rules (§ 21a) don't apply if the taxpayer increases the tax base under § 17k, prioritizing § 17k.<br><br>The rules apply to loan agreements concluded after December 31, 2023, including amendments to pre-existing agreements. § 21a applies only to interest paid to dependent person, irrespective of interest costs amount and calculates with account EBITDA, not including capitalized interest. § 17k applies to interest costs connected with all debts, regardless the creditor and the tax EBITDA is the calculation base, but includes capitalized interest. It´s applicable only above 3,000,000 EUR. § 17k allows to apply unused interest costs in next 5 tax periods.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_91" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_91" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_91" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_92" style="display:none;">The amendment to the Income Tax Act addresses preventive restructuring as per Act No. 111/2022, enabling debtors facing insolvency to proactively implement restructuring measures. This involves creating a plan that may include debt forgiveness. The amendment allows creditors to recognize the forgiven debt as a tax-deductible expense when a preventive restructuring plan is court-approved, provided general conditions are met. Debtors will proceed with standard debt write-off procedures.<br><br>Furthermore, the amendment allows for the inclusion of provisions for receivables from debtors in preventive restructuring proceedings as tax-deductible expenses, similar to standard restructuring. Full provision can be made up to the receivable's nominal value if it was included in taxable income.<br><br>The amendment also adapts to new international accounting standards for the insurance industry, specifically IFRS 17, which replaces IFRS 4. IFRS 17 changes how insurance contract liabilities are reported. Instead of technical reserves, insurers will report liabilities based on discounted cash flow. These costs will be tax-deductible in accordance with accounting practices. Adjustments to the tax base resulting from implementing IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 will be included in the tax base evenly, starting no earlier than January 1, 2023.<br><br>Finally, the amendment adjusts the tax bonus for dependent children following the July 1, 2022 change, allowing for a higher deduction by factoring in the income of both eligible individuals. This aggregation of income will first be applicable for the 2023 tax year. The law also modifies the income tax registration process for specific taxpayer types. Taxpayers will be registered ex officio based on data from public registers and a notice published by the Financial Directorate, starting January 1, 2023.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_92" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_92" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_92" style="display:none;"></p>

While fostering a family-like atmosphere for all employees is beneficial, external hires require similar oversight as in non-family businesses.

The law takes effect in two stages: January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024. Several amendments to the definition of related parties, transfer pricing rules, and the assessment of permanent establishments are introduced, effective from January 1, 2023.<br><br>The definition of related parties is expanded to include cases where close relatives' shares are combined to reach a 25% threshold for economic interconnection. The definition of economic connection is reformulated, specifically addressing relationships between permanent establishments and their founders. The definition of a controlled transaction is adjusted, excluding dependent activities where income falls under § 5 of the Income Tax Act, regardless of whether it's performed by an employee of a related party or a company executive.<br><br>Foreign taxpayers operating in Slovakia through a permanent establishment can now determine the tax base based on the difference between revenues and expenses attributable to the permanent establishment, as determined from the foreign taxpayer's accounting records. The definition of a significant controlled transaction is refined, excluding legal relationships where neither related party achieves taxable income or tax expense exceeding €10,000 (except for loans exceeding €10,000). The law grants the right to a corresponding adjustment of the tax base when a primary adjustment is made in a Slovak legal entity and the counterparty is a Slovak permanent establishment of a non-resident. The determination of the tax base for permanent establishments is aligned with OECD guidelines. The law also adds a reference to OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and clarifies the tax administrator's procedures when prices used in transactions with related parties don't adhere to the arm's length principle. Finally, the documentation can first be submitted in a foreign language, before translating to state language, based on tax authorities decision.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_94" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_94" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_94" style="display:none;"></p>

Selling a business as an individual can incur up to 25% tax plus health insurance contributions, while selling through a legal entity can potentially result in zero taxation under specific conditions. Although gift and inheritance taxes are currently absent, donation contracts and wills cannot impose conditions on recipients.<br><br>Consider a founder whose children inherit equal shares of the company. If the son wants to sell his share and the daughter wishes to continue the business, the son can sell to a foreign investor if the daughter lacks funds to buy him out. Eventually, the daughter might also sell due to disagreements, leading to the demise of the family business and inefficient taxation.<br><br>Family holdings, typically structured as limited liability or joint-stock companies, are the most recognized method for asset consolidation. These companies hold and manage assets and equity in subsidiary companies. Limited liability companies offer the advantage of restricting share transfers and inheritance, alongside lower operating costs. Joint-stock companies allow for unlimited shareholders, shareholder anonymity, and limited liability. For large estates, trusts or private foundations in the Czech Republic can further safeguard assets by separating ownership from the family, reducing risks associated with tax increases or the introduction of wealth taxes. These structures maintain assets as a whole and allow for stipulated rules for their use.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_95" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_95" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_95" style="display:none;"></p>

During this transitional period, the calculation used whichever method (old or new) was more beneficial for the taxpayer.<br><br>Full entitlement to the tax bonus (either €70 or €40) depends on meeting a specific income threshold, calculated as a percentage of the taxpayer's tax base, depending on the number of dependent children.<br><br>Further changes are planned for January 1, 2023, increasing the bonus to €100 for children under 15 and €50 for those aged 15-25. The comparison with the old calculation method will be abolished.<br><br>A draft amendment to the Income Tax Act aims to address situations where taxpayers have too low an income to claim the bonus. They may be allowed to file a tax return (even employees normally eligible for annual settlement) and include the income of another eligible person who jointly supports the child in the household to calculate the bonus. However, these proposed changes are subject to revision.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_97" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_97" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_97" style="display:none;"></p>

Law No. 215/2019 Coll. of 18.6.2019 on guaranteed electronic invoicing and the central economic system has already been approved for this purpose.<br><br>The system's implementation is taking place in several phases. From January 1, 2022, all entities conducting business transactions with public administration bodies (B2G, G2G) are required to record these transactions. From January 1, 2023, all entities will be required to record their business transactions with other businesses (B2B, G2B) and with their customers/end consumers (B2C, G2C).<br><br>The law regulating the submission of invoice data from taxable entities to other businesses or end consumers is still in preparation at the MFSR.<br><br>Preparatory work is currently underway for the second and third phases, according to the following schedule: a public test operation of the IS EFA prototype and OpenAPI for guaranteed electronic invoicing was launched in June 2022, and the full operation of guaranteed electronic invoicing (B2B, B2C, G2B and G2C) is scheduled to start in January 2023. The public testing aims to involve the public in testing the system, gather feedback during development, prepare for upcoming changes, identify shortcomings, and implement improvements before the system's full launch.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_98" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_98" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_98" style="display:none;"></p>

This was stated in a press release by the audit and advisory company Moore BDR. The amount of the finding during inspections in companies has increased by more than half on average. The probability of finding a violation of tax legislation, along with penalties, is growing at a record pace. "When we compare the current three-year period 2018, 2019 and 2020 with the period from 10 years ago, the number of tax audits decreased by approximately 40%, but the amount of findings from tax audits increased by almost 60% over the same period," the company warned. This is a statistic based on data from the Financial Administration.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The number of tax audits has significantly decreased in recent years, with a 40% drop compared to a decade ago. However, the efficiency of the financial administration has improved, leading to a notable increase in the average amount found during company audits. Specifically, the amount of detected violations and associated penalties has risen by approximately 60% over the same period. These statistics, derived from the Financial Administration's data, indicate a higher probability of businesses being found in violation of tax laws, despite the reduced number of audits. This trend underscores the increased effectiveness of current audit processes.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_102" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_102" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_102" style="display:none;"></p>

These amendments offer significant tax relief to companies engaged in these activities.<br><br>Key tax optimization tools include:<br><br>1.  **Patent Box:** A tax regime for legal entities allowing a 50% tax exemption on income from licensing fees for patents, utility models, and software resulting from the company's R&D in Slovakia. A similar exemption applies to 50% of income from product sales utilizing patents or utility models developed by the taxpayer in Slovakia.<br><br>2.  **Super Deduction for R&D Expenses:** Allows companies and the self-employed to deduct R&D expenses from their tax base, in addition to the initial deduction. From 2015 up to 2021, the deduction was 200% of the R&D expenses. In 2022, however, the percentage decreased to 100%.<br><br>3.  **Investment Deduction:** A temporary incentive allowing additional deduction of investment expenses from tax depreciation, ranging from 15% to 55%, depending on the investment amount and targeting productive investments tied to Industry 4.0. This applies to investments in manufacturing and logistics systems (tangible and intangible assets), requiring a minimum investment of €1 million exceeding seven times the average investment over the past three years (2019-2021) and an investment plan covering the period of 2022 to 2025. It applies to legal entities and self-employed persons operating for more than three years.<br><br>Expertise in preparing documentation and adherence to legal requirements are essential when applying these regimes.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_104" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_104" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_104" style="display:none;"></p>

While the younger generation brings fresh perspectives, their entry also presents challenges.<br><br>The solution lies in consolidating the family business's assets. This requires understanding the business's overall situation, including risks, opportunities, structure, liquidity, and financial indicators like cash flow and return on investment. Consolidation ensures a clearly defined structure that maximizes asset efficiency, benefiting relationships with creditors and facilitating intergenerational transfer and inheritance. This consolidation should ideally be done by the original founder who intuitively understands the business and can provide guidance for future generations.<br><br>Proper asset consolidation reduces risks associated with the founder's established influence, which successors need to build anew. A well-consolidated estate provides a solid foundation for them, allowing them to navigate and utilize assets effectively. It also simplifies property rights, reducing potential conflicts arising from multiple heirs. Without consolidation, the "family tree" of ownership relationships can become increasingly complex, hindering decision-making and efficiency across generations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_105" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_105" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_105" style="display:none;"></p>

The inclusion of subsequent generations introduces diverse perspectives, potentially jeopardizing the business if not handled carefully. This transition is a critical, often irreversible operation where inadequate preparation can lead to failure and the gradual erosion of the family's wealth.<br><br>The key solution lies in family asset consolidation, aimed at preventing the fragmentation of strategic assets among future generations while ensuring adequate support for close family members. Assets should remain firmly within the immediate family, avoiding dispersal among different branches, former partners, or individuals outside the core family. Asset consolidation is paramount in safeguarding the family business during generational shifts.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_106" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_106" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_106" style="display:none;"></p>

To eliminate this phenomenon, several initiatives have emerged, including the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) and the related European Union (EU) directives ATAD and ATAD II. These initiatives primarily target companies using aggressive tax structures, but the rules they introduce also affect legitimate holding structures.

These measures aim to counter aggressive tax avoidance but also impact legitimate holding structures. An article by Martin Kiňo in Trend weekly explores current tax trends affecting holding structures. The globalized economy enables companies to exploit tax loopholes through strategies like headquarters relocation, leading to initiatives like BEPS and EU's ATAD directives. While targeting aggressive tax schemes, these regulations also affect compliant holding companies. The article featured discusses these trends and their implications.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_108" style="display:none;">The article discusses new Slovak tax regulations concerning transparent entities like general partnerships and limited partnerships controlled by foreign individuals, effective January 1, 2022. These regulations implement ATAD 2, introducing rules for reverse hybrid entities to tax income allocated to foreign partners if it isn't taxed elsewhere. A "transparent entity" is defined as a partnership where income is taxed at the partner level. A "reverse hybrid entity" is considered transparent in its country of origin but non-transparent by its foreign owner's country, creating a risk of double non-taxation. If foreign partners own 50% or more of a transparent entity, their income will be taxed at the corporate income tax rate of 21% in Slovakia if not taxable elsewhere. A new reporting requirement mandates foreign partners meeting the 50% threshold to declare the company's hybrid status. This applies retroactively to existing entities, requiring notification by January 31, 2022. While the rules primarily target foreign partners, limited partners should still verify the ultimate beneficiary for profit distributions to avoid potential withholding taxes, which can be as high as 35% if the beneficiary is not proven. This is particularly relevant due to ongoing discussions regarding the definition of the "ultimate beneficiary". The complexities necessitate consultation with tax advisors when using transparent entities.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_108" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_108" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_108" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_111" style="display:none;">Tax audits are generally unpleasant for businesses, representing a significant government intervention. However, financial administration statistics show increasing efficiency in tax audits. Compared to a decade ago, the number of tax audits has halved, while the detected discrepancies and resulting fines have increased, indicating more effective audits but greater challenges for taxpayers. VAT remains the primary focus, but tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing other taxes, such as corporate and individual income tax.<br><br>Data from 2018-2020 reveals a higher probability of findings during audits. Taxpayers lacking proper documentation and professional representation are at a disadvantage. The dynamic nature of tax, accounting, and auditing legislation makes it nearly impossible for businesses to manage these areas alongside their core activities. Statistics highlight a high percentage of audits related to employment income tax also resulting in findings.

Key changes include new reporting obligations for VAT payers, specifically concerning bank accounts used for business, which must be reported to the Financial Directorate. These accounts will be publicly accessible to minimize the risk of liability for unpaid VAT. Existing VAT payers had to report their accounts by November 30, 2021, while newly registered payers must do so immediately. Failure to comply results in fines and delays in VAT refunds.<br><br>The amendment also expands liability for unpaid VAT, creating a presumption that customers knew or should have known if a supplier would not pay VAT, especially if payment was made to an unreported bank account. To avoid liability, customers can verify the supplier's bank account against the Financial Directorate's list or use "split payment," where the VAT portion of the invoice is paid directly to the tax authority. Registration cards are eliminated from January 1, 2022, and OSS scheme rules clarified.

Over 200 attendees, including family business owners, experts, partners, and media representatives from Slovakia and abroad, participated in the one-day event. Six expert speakers shared their experiences on topics such as managing family businesses, marketing, and, crucially, succession planning.<br><br>The congress featured an online video interview with Zengoro Hoshi, successor of the world's oldest family-run hotel, Hoshi Ryokan in Japan. He emphasized the importance of securing successors, whether through family or adoption, for the survival of family firms. Adrianna Lewandowska, president of the Polish Institute of Family Business, highlighted that many smaller firms don't identify as family businesses and dispelled the misconception that they are less professional than corporations, citing examples like Walmart and Adidas. She also presented the concept of a Family Constitution. A unique publication on succession planning, "Generational Exchange Step by Step," was also introduced. Ján Oravec, State Secretary of the Ministry of Economy, announced the upcoming definition of a family firm in Slovakia. Digital marketing consultant Paolo Ramazzotti advised on social media strategies for family businesses. Gabriela Končitíková shared the Bata company's succession secret: every key manager had a replaceable counterpart.

The Slovak National Council approved Law No. 198/2020, amending the requirements for auditing individual financial statements. Effective January 1, 2021, and January 1, 2022, the size criteria for mandatory audits were adjusted.<br><br>For 2021, an audit is required if a company exceeds two of the following criteria: total assets over €3,000,000, net turnover over €6,000,000, or an average of more than 40 employees. For 2022, the thresholds increase to €4,000,000 in assets, €8,000,000 in turnover, and 50 employees. These criteria are assessed based on the accounting period in which the period began and the previous period.<br><br>Even without a legal obligation, a voluntary audit can benefit a company by enhancing financial reliability and trust with stakeholders, identifying risks, improving internal controls, and providing assurance to management. It also helps verify tax accuracy, offers insights from auditors' industry experience, and can be beneficial when seeking loans. An example illustrates how these criteria apply to a company with a non-calendar fiscal year, demonstrating the assessment process for audit obligations.

The bill aims to address the issue of housing affordability and accessibility for a broad range of the population.<br><br>A key element is the introduction of a state-supported rental housing allowance, capped at €4 per square meter of floor space and a maximum of €360 per month, to be provided by employers. Employees can only claim this allowance from one employer per month. The allowance is proposed to be tax-exempt and considered a tax-deductible expense for employers.<br><br>The bill also proposes reducing the depreciation period for buildings used for state-subsidized rental housing from 40 to 20 years. It suggests income from the sale of mutual fund shares held for over 36 months to be tax-free. Additionally, a reduced VAT rate of 5% is proposed for the supply of buildings (including land and parking spaces), renovations, and reconstructions intended for state-subsidized rental housing, provided the recipient is a state-supported rental housing landlord with a building operation agreement.<br><br>The bill also aims to remove restrictions on the option to choose taxation for the supply of buildings intended for state-supported rental housing, allowing VAT payers to opt for taxation on previously tax-exempt properties.<br><br>The bill will undergo interdepartmental review, with a deadline for discussion in committees set for mid-September 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_123" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_123" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_123" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_124" style="display:none;">Slovakia implemented "Kurzarbeit" (short-time work) from January 1, 2022, through a law supporting reduced working hours. This aims to aid both employers and employees during crises when employers cannot assign work due to external factors. Employers who pay insurance for this scheme are eligible. This insurance is part of the unemployment insurance, with the employer's 1% contribution split into 0.5% for short-time work support and 0.5% for unemployment insurance.<br><br>If external factors like emergencies, states of exception, or force majeure prevent employers from providing work, they can apply for "Kurzarbeit" support from the Social Insurance Agency via the Labor, Social Affairs and Family Office. This support is then used to pay employee wage compensation. External factors exclude war, seasonality, restructuring, or planned shutdowns.<br><br>Eligible employers are both individuals and legal entities under specific Social Insurance Act provisions. Eligible employees are those in employment or civil service, or under contract for professional sports. A key condition is that at least one-third of employees cannot be assigned work for at least 10% of their weekly hours. Employers must have paid social insurance and pension contributions for 24 months, not have violated illegal employment bans, and have a written agreement with employee representatives (or employees) or an arbitrator's approval to apply for support.<br><br>The support covers 60% of the average hourly earnings for each hour of work obstacle, but is capped, and employers must pay employees at least 80% of their average earnings (or the minimum wage). Support is provided for a maximum of 6 months within 24 consecutive months, and employers must maintain the supported job for at least 2 months after the period of work obstacle.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_124" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_124" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_124" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_127" style="display:none;">The amendment to the Labor Code, effective from March 1, 2021, and January 1, 2022, introduces several changes. Employees can now choose between meal vouchers and a financial contribution to meals, with the amount being at least 55% of the minimum value of a meal voucher. Employers who already have voucher contracts are exempt until those expire, but no later than January 1, 2023, is when electronic meal vouchers are planned. Temporary assignment of employees between parent and subsidiary companies is simplified, removing the requirement for objective operational reasons and a minimum employment period if the assignment is unpaid.<br><br>The definition of an employee permanently caring for a child is clarified, affecting vacation entitlement. Employees personally caring for a child, including through shared custody, are entitled to five weeks of vacation. Regular work from home, whether termed homeworking or teleworking, must be agreed upon in the employment contract. Employees have the right to disconnect, are treated equally to on-site staff, and employers may be obligated to cover increased expenses. The trial period is extended by any full-day absences of the employee.<br><br>Employers can now terminate employment when an employee turns 65 and is eligible for a retirement pension. Fifteen-year-olds who haven't completed compulsory education can be employed for light work with labor inspectorate permission. Students retain their student status until October 31st of the year they graduate. Disputes about trade union representation at a workplace are resolved by an arbitrator appointed by mutual agreement or by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_127" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_127" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_127" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_129" style="display:none;">The article discusses upcoming amendments to the Labor Code and the Tax Code in Slovakia. The Labor Code amendment, expected to be effective from January 1, 2022, addresses issues with meal vouchers, allowing employers to contribute up to 100% of the meal allowance for business trips (5-12 hours), capped at €5.10 with tax and levy exemptions. It also permits retroactive meal voucher and financial contribution payments to alleviate calculation issues due to unforeseen circumstances. Self-employed individuals can claim €5.10 for meals per workday without needing to provide proof.<br><br>The Tax Code amendment proposes several changes, including abolishing registration cards, reducing the binding opinion fee to €1,000 (or €500 for highly reliable taxpayers), introducing a tax reliability index with associated benefits and drawbacks, and implementing a mechanism to exclude individuals who severely breach tax obligations from holding statutory positions in companies. Other changes include eliminating summary protocols, requiring evidence for excused absences from tax proceedings, enabling joint acts for evidence collection, allowing witness and expert testimony via videoconference, streamlining the delivery of tax assessment protocols, clarifying tax debt extinction, and addressing bank account registration and VAT liability. VAT payers will be required to register their bank accounts for business use with the Financial Directorate, and the Directorate will publish and update these accounts daily. Purchasers will have the ability to pay VAT liability of sellers to the tax office directly, in the event the seller fails to do so. Most of these changes are expected to be effective from January 1, 2022, with bank account registration required by November 30, 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_129" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_129" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_129" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_131" style="display:none;">Experts Erika Matwij and Martin Kiňo from the Association of Family Businesses Partners discuss current topics relevant to family businesses. Succession planning is a key issue, with the present situation offering an opportune moment for the younger generation to step up. The external pressures of the COVID-19 crisis have highlighted the need for well-defined family and business relationships. Owners should involve successors in management and problem-solving, despite the challenges of being both a leader and a mentor.<br><br>Preparing the next generation involves careful management transfer. An academy for successors helps develop essential skills through practical training and internships in successful family businesses. The program focuses on understanding the successor role, managing generational differences, and developing business strategies, brand building, international expansion, controlling, and innovation management.<br><br>If a family successor is unavailable, hiring a professional manager is an option, either internally or externally. The key is to find someone whose values and management principles align with the owner's. Alternatively, seeking an investor can bring in new management or lead to a full acquisition.<br><br>The upcoming legislation regulating trust and foundation funds is sparking interest in protecting family and business assets. Holding structures are becoming standard, improving financial transparency and cost allocation. These structures facilitate risk diversification and investor access. Trust and foundation funds can further protect assets by preventing fragmentation and ensuring support for family members, even excluding certain individuals. These funds, managed by a trustee appointed by the founder, also protect against mismanagement and third-party claims, offering a degree of anonymity. Standard operating costs are comparable to those of a regular business. Super deductions for research and development expenses and patent boxes for income from self-developed intangible assets are underutilized tax incentives worth exploring.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_131" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_131" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_131" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_132" style="display:none;">Effective May 1, 2021, amendments to the Building Act regarding advertising structures come into force. Advertising structures will now only be permitted for a definite period, not exceeding three years, through the building permit process. Previously, advertising structures could be permitted indefinitely.<br><br>If the owner does not apply for an extension, they are obligated to remove the advertising structure within 30 days after its permit expires. This also applies if the building authority decides not to extend the permit; the structure must be removed within 30 days of the decision becoming legally binding. Failure to comply can result in the decision serving as an enforcement title for execution.<br><br>The range of entities that can initiate the removal of illegal advertising structures is expanded to include municipalities for structures within their administrative areas. The process for removing illegal advertising structures (those without a building permit or in violation of one) is simplified, allowing the building authority to issue consent for removal within 30 days of a notification.<br><br>Furthermore, penalties for non-compliance are increased. These penalties vary based on the size of the advertising surface, rising from the current €150-€450 to €450-€1,350. All existing building permits for advertising structures issued indefinitely will become valid for a limited period of up to three years from the law's effective date, meaning until April 30, 2024. The law itself took effect on May 1, 2021.<br><br>It is recommended to consult with a construction professional to identify affected advertising structures and adjust accounting depreciation periods to three years or multiples thereof, aligning with potential permit extensions.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_132" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_132" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_132" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_134" style="display:none;">Clarification of Criteria for Determining Corporate Tax Residence<br><br>The criteria for determining a legal entity's tax residence in Slovakia have been refined. A legal entity is considered a Slovak resident if its registered office or place of effective management is within the Slovak Republic. The concept of "place of effective management" now specifically refers to the location where crucial managerial and business decisions for the entity as a whole are made or received, regardless of who makes them. Decisions pertaining to smaller organizational units or administrative matters are excluded. This clarification is particularly relevant for companies with international ownership structures, especially those with foreign holding companies.<br><br>Changes to the 15% Reduced Tax Rate Application<br><br>Effective from January 1, 2021, the 15% tax rate is exclusively for taxpayers (legal entities or sole traders) whose taxable income does not exceed €49,790 per tax period. This applies even to micro-taxpayers, and only taxable income is considered for this threshold. For the 2020 tax period, the income limit for the 15% rate was €100,000.<br><br>Exclusion of Cross-Border Workers<br><br>The method for determining tax residence for individuals who cross the border daily to work in Slovakia and would otherwise be tax residents has changed. From January 1, 2021, their tax residence will be determined based on tie-breaker rules outlined in the relevant double taxation treaties. A similar approach applies to legal entities to resolve dual residency conflicts.<br><br>Exemption for "First Aid" Labor Policy Benefits<br><br>Benefits provided under active labor policy measures for employment retention projects during declared states of emergency, states of emergency, or exceptional states related to COVID-19 are now tax-exempt. This includes "First Aid" contributions intended to support employers during the pandemic. Similarly, benefits provided by the Ministry of Culture to support artists are also exempt. Expenses incurred for these tax-exempt incomes must be excluded from tax-deductible expenses.<br><br>Micro-Taxpayer's Tax Deduction for Bad Debt Write-off<br><br>From January 1, 2021, micro-taxpayers can deduct the write-off of bad debts, up to the amount of the provision created for them, provided the debt was previously included in taxable income.<br><br>Annual Tax Reconciliation by Any Employer<br><br>Starting in 2021, employees can request an annual tax reconciliation from any employer they received income from during the tax period, not just the last one where they claimed tax reliefs. The process for calculating the annual tax reconciliation has also been clarified.<br><br>Elimination of Reconciliation for Paid vs. Due Tax Advances<br><br>The obligation to reconcile the difference between paid and due tax advances by the end of the month following the tax return deadline has been removed. Paid advances for a tax period will be applied towards the tax liability for that period.<br><br>Abolition of 13th and 14th Salary Tax Exemption<br><br>The tax exemption for 13th and 14th salaries, provided for summer holidays and Christmas, has been abolished effective January 1, 2021. The last eligible period for this exemption was for Christmas bonuses paid by December 31, 2020.<br><br>Gradual Change in Child Tax Bonus Amounts<br><br>The tax bonus for children has been adjusted. From January 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021, children under six receive double the bonus, while older children receive one times the bonus. Further adjustments are scheduled from July 1, 2021, with increased bonuses for older children until December 31, 2022.<br><br>Cancellation of Spa Care Tax Relief<br><br>The tax-exempt portion of income for spa care and related services, up to €50 per year, has been canceled from 2021. The last time this relief could be claimed was for the 2020 tax period.<br><br>Clarification of Definition for Non-Cooperating States<br><br>From 2021, countries on the EU's "black list" of non-cooperating tax jurisdictions, those not applying corporate income tax, or those with a 0% corporate income tax rate will be excluded from Slovakia's national list of cooperating states. This exclusion will not affect the application of double taxation treaties.<br><br>Establishment of a Permanent Establishment<br><br>If a foreign tax entity establishes a permanent establishment in Slovakia, it must retroactively fulfill employer obligations, including tax withholding and reporting, from the start of the activity. The foreign entity must file a tax return and pay the tax within three months of discovering the permanent establishment. The existence of a permanent establishment is assessed from the date of commencing activities on Slovak territory as per contractual agreements.<br><br>Other Changes from January 1, 2021<br><br>Preferential tax depreciation for buildings in the spa industry and for company apartments has been abolished. The tax-exempt amount for spa care and related services for individuals has been canceled.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>Slovak tax law amendments effective January 1, 2021, introduced significant changes. Corporate tax residence criteria are now more precise, focusing on the place of effective management. The 15% reduced tax rate is limited to lower-income taxpayers, with a reduced threshold from previous years. The exemption for cross-border workers' tax residence determination has been removed, relying on double taxation treaties. Benefits from the "First Aid" program for employment retention during COVID-19 are tax-exempt, as are cultural support payments. The 13th and 14th salaries are no longer tax-exempt. Child tax bonus amounts have been adjusted, with increases for older children over time. Tax relief for spa care has been abolished, as has preferential depreciation for spa buildings and company apartments. The definition of non-cooperating states has been clarified, excluding those on the EU's blacklist. Foreign entities establishing a permanent establishment in Slovakia now have specific retroactive compliance obligations. The annual tax reconciliation process has been simplified, allowing employees to choose any employer. The reconciliation of tax advance differences has also been eliminated.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_134" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_134" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_134" style="display:none;"></p>

For reverse hybrid entities, if the entity is considered transparent in its country of origin but a separate taxable entity in the founder's country, creating a risk of double non-taxation, income attributable to foreign shareholders owning 50% or more of the transparent company will be taxed at the corporate income tax rate of 21% at the level of the transparent company if it cannot be taxed through a permanent establishment. A new reporting obligation is introduced for foreign shareholders of transparent companies to declare the company's status.<br><br>CFC rules are extended to individuals to prevent profit shifting to tax havens. An entity is considered a CFC if an individual, alone or with related parties, holds at least 10% of the capital, voting rights, or profit share or exercises actual control and is located in a non-cooperative state or has an effective tax rate below 10%. Profits from CFCs will be taxed at 25% or 35% before distribution.

This initiative, driven by the EU and OECD, seeks to enhance tax transparency and information exchange among member states, combating aggressive tax practices and promoting fair taxation.<br><br>The reporting duty falls upon intermediaries (tax advisors, lawyers, accountants, auditors) or users involved in cross-border arrangements. Intermediaries are obligated to report unless bound by confidentiality, in which case the responsibility shifts to the user. A cross-border arrangement involves at least two member states, a member and non-member state, or aims to circumvent automatic financial account information exchange or beneficial ownership identification. The arrangement must meet specific hallmarks, either general or specific, with general hallmarks and some specific ones requiring a "main benefit test," demonstrating a primary purpose of achieving a tax advantage.<br><br>Hallmarks include confidentiality agreements, success-based fees, standardized structures, transfer and cross-border use of losses, income conversion, multiple depreciation claims, and transfer pricing issues with hard-to-value intangibles and opaque ownership structures.<br><br>Failure to comply with DAC6 reporting deadlines can result in penalties up to €30,000.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_137" style="display:none;">Corporate income tax advance payments are governed by Section 42 of Act No. 595/2003 Coll. An obligation to pay advance payments arises if the corporate income tax for the previous tax period exceeds EUR 5,000. Depending on the amount of this last known tax liability, the corporation is obliged to pay quarterly advance payments, due by the end of the respective calendar quarter, if the tax for the previous period exceeded EUR 5,000 but did not exceed EUR 16,600, or monthly advance payments, due by the end of the respective calendar month, if the tax exceeded EUR 16,600.<br><br>The obligation to pay advance payments does not apply if the tax administrator determines otherwise, specifically to taxpayers whose tax for the previous period did not exceed EUR 5,000, those in liquidation or bankruptcy, or those filing a tax return for the first time, until the deadline for filing the return. In this case, the advance payments due up to the filing deadline are settled by the end of the month following the filing deadline.<br><br>The tax for the previous period is calculated from the tax base reduced by tax loss stated in the tax return filed for the period immediately preceding the current one, using the tax rate specified in that return, reduced by any applicable allowances. The calculation considers the tax rate valid in the relevant period (either 21% or, from 2020, potentially 15% for taxpayers with income not exceeding EUR 100,000, later replaced by 49,790 EUR). From 2021, only taxable income is included in the income calculation for the 15% rate.<br><br>Advance payments are calculated differently before and after the tax return filing deadline. Before the deadline, they're based on the "last known tax liability" from the previous year. After the deadline, they're based on the tax for the previous period as reported in the filed tax return, considering the taxpayer's taxable income and applicable tax rate (15% or 21%). A change effective from January 1, 2021, eliminated the obligation to settle any difference between advance payments made before the filing deadline and the actual tax liability calculated in the tax return. Overpaid amounts are either credited towards future payments or refunded upon request.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_137" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_137" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_137" style="display:none;"></p>

Further changes are planned from February 2021, with the "First Aid Plus Plus" project intending to broaden target groups and increase aid amounts, extending the project until June 30, 2021.<br><br>Entities starting work or business by February 1, 2021, can apply, and contributions can be claimed for employees hired by the same date. Employers, including the self-employed acting as employers, could previously apply for aid under measures 1 and 3, covering employers with mandatory closures (Measure 1) or inability to assign work (Measure 3A) or revenue decline (Measure 3B).<br><br>The "First Aid Plus Plus" project increases contributions under Measures 1 and 3A to 100% of the total labor cost (up from 80%), capped at €1,100. Measure 3B expands revenue decline categories from four to seven, ranging from €330 to €870, with the maximum contribution for an 80% or more revenue decline rising from €810 to €870. These improved conditions apply to requests and reports submitted for February 2021 onwards, up to €1.6 million per company. After exceeding this limit, contributions will continue at 80% of the total labor cost. Self-employed individuals (SZČO) who aren't employers could apply for contributions under Measures 2 and 4, with Measure 2 covering those with mandatory closures or revenue decline, and Measures 4A and 4B targeting specific groups. "First Aid Plus Plus" increases financial contributions under Measure 2 by changing revenue decline categories and raising the flat-rate contribution from €330 to €870. Measure 4A and 4B provides a flat-rate contribution of €360, up from €315. These increases apply to requests and reports submitted for February 2021 onwards. The Ministry recommends self-employed individuals under Measure 4A and 4B to switch to Measure 2 for a potentially higher contribution of up to €870, provided they voluntarily obtain sickness and pension insurance by February 15, 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_138" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_138" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_138" style="display:none;"></p>

This measure applies retroactively to the entire pandemic, including the 2020 tax year. Crucially, non-monetary benefits related to employee and relative testing will not be taxed during the pandemic.

The goal is to alleviate the financial burden associated with testing and support individuals and businesses impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with the amendments applied to the entire duration of the pandemic period to provide maximal help.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_140" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_140" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_140" style="display:none;"></p>

The amendment removes the "pairing" condition for tractor units and semi-trailers and introduces a lower annual tax rate for these vehicles as stated in the annex No. 1a. Additionally, new percentage reductions in the annual tax rate are introduced for M2, M3, and N3 category commercial vehicles. Adjustments to annual tax rates based on vehicle age are implemented, with separate scales for different vehicle categories. Specific reductions are provided for vehicles in categories M2, M3, and N3, depending on their age. Category O4 vehicles (trailers over 10 tons) receive a 60% tax reduction, irrespective of age. The 50% tax reduction for special vehicles (hybrids, CNG/LNG/hydrogen powered) remains unchanged. These changes are applicable for the 2020 tax return, exceptionally due on March 31, 2021, and tax advances for 2021 are waived. The Ministry of Finance will provide a new tax return form.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_142" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_142" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_142" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_143" style="display:none;">A July 1, 2021 amendment to the VAT Act introduces significant changes, particularly concerning distance selling. The term "distance selling" is replaced by "distance selling of goods within the European Union" or "distance selling of goods imported from third countries." The legislation now defines these sales and updates rules for determining the place of supply to align with taxation at the place of consumption within the EU.<br><br>Foreign entities registered for distance selling in Slovakia under the previous § 6 will have their VAT identification numbers automatically considered valid under § 5, ensuring continued registration as taxpayers. The amendment also establishes specific places of supply for distance selling within the EU and certain services to non-taxable persons, with a unified threshold of €10,000 for cross-border sales annually.<br><br>This aims to reduce administrative burdens by eliminating country-specific thresholds for distance selling. The changes also introduce special procedures, including the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) for specific services to EU consumers by non-EU suppliers, and the expanded One Stop Shop (OSS) covering intra-EU distance sales of goods and services supplied by EU businesses to non-taxable persons in other member states. The Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) facilitates VAT declaration and payment for imported goods valued up to €150, with online platforms taking responsibility for tax collection.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_143" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_143" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_143" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_144" style="display:none;">**Correction of Tax Base and VAT Deduction for Uncollectible Receivables in Slovakia**<br><br>Under new Slovakian VAT regulations, VAT payers can adjust their tax base if a customer fails to fully or partially pay for goods or services after the VAT obligation arises, and the receivable becomes uncollectible. The tax base can be reduced up to the unpaid amount. The difference between the original and adjusted tax base and VAT is reported in the tax period the receivable becomes uncollectible.<br><br>A receivable becomes uncollectible based on specific legal circumstances, such as execution proceedings, bankruptcy proceedings, debt relief proceedings, or the debtor ceasing to exist without a legal successor.<br><br>Concurrently, if a VAT payer reduces the tax base due to an uncollectible receivable, the customer who deducted VAT on the unpaid supply must correct their VAT deduction. This correction occurs in the tax period when the customer receives the adjustment document from the supplier.<br><br>Furthermore, a new VAT return form and control statement will be introduced from January 1, 2021. These forms will accommodate the tax base adjustments for uncollectible receivables and the corresponding VAT deduction corrections. The revised control statement should be used for tax periods starting on or after January 1, 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_144" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_144" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_144" style="display:none;"></p>

The subject of the tax now includes vehicles registered in Slovakia used for business during the tax period. "Used for business" encompasses actual use, accounting entries, inclusion in tax records, claiming expenses, or use by specific taxpayer categories. Vehicles must also belong to categories L, M, N, or O.<br><br>Tax liability arises on the first day of the month when a vehicle is registered and used for business.

Those with estimated tax between €700 and €8300 pay quarterly, and those above €8300 pay monthly. Taxpayers were exempt from prepayments from April 2020 due to COVID-19 measures, but this exemption ended on September 30, 2020.

Based on the amendment to Act No. 67/2020, Section 2, Paragraph 3 was supplemented stating that for purposes of measures under specific sections (§ 3 and 4, § 6, § 8 to 12, § 16 to 18a, § 20 to 24a, § 24c to 24h, § 24j, § 24n and 24o, § 33, 34, § 36 paragraphs 1 and 3, § 36a, and § 36c paragraphs 1 and 2), the pandemic period is considered to have ended on September 30, 2020, while for measures under § 7, 24i, and 31, the pandemic period is considered to have ended on December 31, 2020. These changes effectively roll back certain COVID-19 related financial relief measures.<br><br>This article explains a legislative amendment that terminated certain pandemic-related financial measures in Slovakia. Effective September 29, 2020, Act No. 264/2020 modified Act No. 67/2020. The core change is the abolition of the designated "pandemic period" for specific financial obligations. Crucially, for tax purposes, the pandemic period ended on September 30, 2020. This impacts tax return submissions, tax payments, advance payments, and financial statement preparation and filing. The amendment clarifies that for most financial measures, the pandemic period concluded on September 30, 2020, but for a few specific measures, it extended to December 31, 2020. This effectively signals the winding down of some financial support mechanisms put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_147" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_147" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_147" style="display:none;"></p>

The calculation will be based on the consumption stated in the registration certificate or technical passport, or in supplementary data from the manufacturer or seller. The option to prove tax costs based on consumption proven by a document issued by an authorized organization or according to a company's internal act (for trucks and work mechanisms) remains.<br><br>Waiver of settlement of differences in paid prepayments<br><br>Legal entities that paid lower prepayments or no prepayments during the pandemic, based on adopted measures, will not have to settle the difference in prepayments by the end of the calendar month following the deadline for filing tax returns. This applies to prepayments paid and due from the beginning of the tax period until the deadline for filing tax returns, i.e., for the tax period:<br>a. which is a calendar year starting no earlier than January 1, 2020,<br>b. in which there was a change in the tax period from a calendar year to a fiscal year, and which began after January 1, 2020,<br>c. which is a fiscal year for which the regular or extended deadline for filing income tax returns expired during the pandemic period,<br>d. which is a fiscal year, at least one month of which falls into the calendar year 2020.<br><br>The deadline for submitting documentation requested by the tax administrator for a tax audit will be doubled.<br><br>The minimum deadline for responding to a tax audit protocol, within which the audited taxpayer must comment on the findings in the protocol, will be extended from 15 days to 30 working days. This deadline will first apply to protocols prepared after June 30, 2020.<br><br>Conditions for applying tax loss deductions under Lex Corona are clarified.<br><br>If the deadline for filing an income tax return expires in 2020 for multiple tax periods, the taxpayer can only apply the preferential tax loss deduction in one tax period.<br><br>Prohibition of Social Insurance Agency from requesting information it already possesses.<br><br>With the amendment to the Social Insurance Act, the obligation for employers to notify the Social Insurance Agency (hereinafter "SP") of facts that SP can ascertain otherwise will be abolished.

The mandatory audit thresholds for companies are gradually increasing until 2022. Fuel expense deductions will be more realistic, automatically increasing consumption figures by 20%. Companies that paid reduced tax prepayments during the pandemic will not need to settle the difference until after the tax return deadline. Deadlines for responding to tax audit findings are doubled to 30 working days. The application of tax loss deductions is limited to one period per taxpayer under Lex Corona. The Social Insurance Agency's ability to request information it already possesses is restricted, reducing employer notification burdens. Tax and social security laws will be amended annually, effective January 1st. Other measures include removing bureaucratic hurdles for SMEs, such as for travel agencies and vehicle inspections.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_153" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_153" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_153" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_154" style="display:none;">TEMPORARY RENT PROTECTION<br><br>A new amendment to Act No. 62/2020 Coll. on certain extraordinary measures related to the spread of a dangerous infectious human disease COVID-19 and in justice, and amending and supplementing certain laws, referred to as the "Temporary Rent Protection Act," provides temporary rent protection for tenants (both business and non-business) if they fall into arrears with rent and other rent-related payments due to circumstances stemming from the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>Under Section 3b of Act No. 62/2020 Coll. on Temporary Protection, a landlord cannot unilaterally terminate a lease of real estate (including residential and non-residential premises) until December 31, 2020, for a tenant's delay in paying rent, including charges for services typically associated with the lease, that became due between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, provided the tenant's delay resulted from circumstances originating from the spread of COVID-19. The tenant must sufficiently substantiate the reason for the delay. Other grounds for lease termination remain unaffected.<br><br>For a tenant to receive temporary rent protection, they must meet these conditions: the rent arrears must be for the period between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020; the payment delay must be due to COVID-19-related circumstances; and the reason for the delay must be sufficiently evidenced. Delays occurring before April 1, 2020, or after June 30, 2020, allow landlords to terminate the lease unilaterally, regardless of the reason for the delay. The act does not prohibit termination for other reasons and does not specify landlords' claims for tenant payment delays, such as late interest. After December 31, 2020, tenants lose this protection, and landlords can terminate leases for delays occurring between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020.<br><br>SUBSIDY FOR RENT PAYMENT<br><br>The amendment to Act No. 71/2013 Coll. on subsidies and the supplementing of Act No. 62/2020 Coll. has introduced a new state contribution – a subsidy for rent payment. This subsidy aims to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on businesses.<br><br>Conditions for the subsidy include an existing lease agreement, rent agreed in monetary form, the tenant's right to use the rented property acquired no later than February 1, 2020, and that the use of the property was hindered due to government measures against COVID-19. Hindrances include closure, interruption of schooling, or significant restrictions on public access. The subsidy can be applied for by landlords, including individuals and legal entities, whether business or non-business. Changes to lease agreements made after March 12, 2020, are disregarded for subsidy purposes. The "rented property" for this subsidy includes commercial spaces used for selling goods or services to consumers and market places.<br><br>The subsidy is granted based on the rent discount agreed between landlord and tenant, capped at 50% of the rent for the period of hindered use. This requires a joint application signed by both parties. The subsidy does not cover ancillary services like energy payments or turnover-based rent components. If services are inseparable from rent, a 5% reduction in rent is assumed. For state property managers, rent is automatically halved, making the subsidy 50% of the original rent. The application is submitted electronically via a form on the Ministry of Economy's website. The electronic form, bearing authorized signatures, serves as proof of the discount agreement. The subsidy is approved via electronic notification to both parties. To qualify, applicants must have settled financial relations with the state budget, have no enforcement proceedings against them, not have violated illegal employment bans in the past three years, and have no outstanding social or health insurance payments. Other conditions, like not being in insolvency or bankruptcy, not having a ban on receiving subsidies, and not having a ban on receiving EU funds, are confirmed by declaration. If the subsidy exceeds €100,000, the beneficial owner must be identified, and false declarations can lead to repayment.<br><br>If the tenant has paid rent for the entire or partial period of hindered use, the subsidy can be granted for a period equal to the hindrance, up to 50% of the rent, based on the agreed discount. If no discount was agreed upon, the tenant can pay the outstanding rent in up to 48 equal monthly installments, starting the month after the state of emergency ends, with payments due by the 15th of each month, unless otherwise agreed.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_154" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_154" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_154" style="display:none;"></p>

The project offers four measures: support for employers (including self-employed individuals who are employers) who closed operations due to the emergency, support for self-employed individuals whose businesses were closed by the Public Health Office or experienced a 20% revenue drop, support for employers retaining jobs during business interruptions, and support for self-employed individuals and single-owner limited liability companies with no other income since March 13, 2020.<br><br>Contribution amounts are being adjusted, with the maximum capped at 80% of an employee's gross wage for Measure 3B. For April, the flat-rate contribution has doubled compared to March for measures considering revenue decline (Measures 2 and 3B). Employers can switch measures for April and, with multiple operations, apply for Measures 1 and 3 concurrently on different premises. However, certain combinations of measures are mutually exclusive.<br><br>The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family apologized for errors in the April statements for Measures 1 and 3, requesting corrected submissions. Measure 4 has also seen changes, with new conditions for single-owner LLCs (no employees) and broader income exclusion criteria. Deadlines for applications for Measure 4 have been extended based on the period of no income.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_155" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_155" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_155" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_156" style="display:none;">On April 14, 2020, the government approved changes to the employment support project during the state of emergency, expanding aid for employers and employees. This is the third type of social assistance available from the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family starting April 17, 2020, in the form of contributions. Applications for the first and second measures began on April 6 and April 8, 2020, respectively.<br><br>The support measures aim to compensate for wage replacements or provide fixed contributions based on reduced revenue. Employers who were forced to close their operations can receive up to 80% of an employee's average earnings, capped at €1,100 per month. Other employers facing operational obstacles or revenue declines can receive contributions based on specific criteria. Self-employed individuals (SZČO) and individuals without other income are also eligible for support, with amounts varying based on their insurance status and revenue drops. For example, SZČO with at least a 10% revenue drop in March 2020 could receive €90, while an 80% drop in April/May could yield €540. A SOS subsidy of €210 per month is available for individuals who lost income due to the crisis and are not receiving pensions or other benefits. Eligibility criteria include being insured, having a revenue drop, and fulfilling tax and social security obligations. Employers must commit to not terminating employment for two months after receiving support and demonstrate their financial standing. The definition of "revenue" for these contributions is specified for both legal entities and individuals.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_156" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_156" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_156" style="display:none;"></p>

This rule does not apply to advance payments determined by tax authorities.<br><br>The regulation aims to allow all taxpayers to pay income tax advance payments under more favorable conditions based on their filed tax returns, ensuring no one pays higher advance payments during the pandemic than before.<br><br>Taxpayers are categorized into four groups regarding advance payments:<br>1. Those whose revenue decreased by 40% compared to the same period in the previous year: They do not pay advance payments for the period immediately following the revenue drop until the end of the pandemic.<br>2. Those who filed their 2019 tax return during the pandemic and had a lower tax liability than in 2018: They pay advance payments based on the lower 2019 liability and will receive a refund for overpaid advance payments from April 2020.<br>3. Those who filed their 2019 tax return during the pandemic and had a higher tax liability than in 2018: They continue to pay advance payments based on their 2018 liability until the end of the month following the crisis state's termination and must pay the difference between the 2018 and 2019 advance payments.<br>4. Those who wish to adjust their advance payment obligations differently: This can be done upon request to the tax authority, which will determine the advance payments.<br><br>If a taxpayer paid higher advance payments for April than permitted by Lex Corona, they can request a refund or use the difference for future payments. Refunds are processed within 30 days if requested after April 30, 2020, or by May 31, 2020, if requested by the end of April 2020.<br><br>Penalties apply for reducing a tax credit claimed during the pandemic and subsequently filing an amended return with a lower credit; a 100% penalty on the difference will be imposed, and the difference must be repaid. Lex Corona III also introduced changes regarding penalties for late payment of certain advance tax payments, withholding tax, or tax security amounts during the pandemic, with late payment interest applicable.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_157" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_157" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_157" style="display:none;"></p>

This now includes those who can pay tax and social security dues in installments and those whose applications were previously rejected due to February 2020 compliance issues.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_160" style="display:none;">On May 11, 2020, a new government bill concerning social insurance and other laws was submitted, specifically regulating the commencement and termination of mandatory sickness and pension insurance for self-employed individuals (SZČO). This proposal targets SZČO who had not yet filed their 2019 tax returns by March 31, 2020, as per Law No. 67/2020 Z. z. (Lex Corona), and those whose deadline for filing their 2019 personal income tax return was extended.<br><br>For SZČO whose extended deadline to file their 2019 tax return under Law No. 67/2020 Z. z. had passed, mandatory insurance commencement would be assessed from the first day of the third calendar month following the expiry of their tax filing deadline. Their mandatory insurance termination would be assessed on the last day of the second calendar month following the expiry of their tax filing deadline.<br><br>For SZČO with an extended 2019 tax filing deadline, a new assessment date for mandatory sickness and pension insurance was proposed, linked to their tax filing deadline. The decisive date was September 30, 2020. If the final day for filing the 2019 tax return was after September 30, 2020, the procedure would be the same as for the first group of SZČO. If the extended Lex Corona deadline expired by September 30, 2020, mandatory insurance would commence on December 1, 2020, and terminate on September 30, 2020.<br><br>A condition for insurance commencement is that the SZČO's income for 2019 exceeds 12 times the minimum assessment base (EUR 6,078). If income falls below this threshold, mandatory insurance will terminate.<br><br>Additionally, a transitional provision proposes temporarily suspending the mechanism for increasing meal allowances and basic vehicle reimbursement rates until December 31, 2021.<br><br>A government bill was presented on May 11, 2020, to amend the Social Insurance Act and related laws. It specifically addresses the commencement and termination of mandatory sickness and pension insurance for self-employed individuals (SZČO). The bill targets SZČO who had an extended deadline for filing their 2019 tax returns, either due to the Lex Corona law or other extensions.<br><br>For those with extended deadlines, the commencement of mandatory insurance is linked to the period after their tax filing deadline expires. For SZČO whose extended deadline was before September 30, 2020, insurance would start on December 1, 2020, and end on September 30, 2020. If their deadline was after September 30, 2020, their insurance commencement and termination dates would be determined by the third and second months after their extended filing deadline, respectively.<br><br>A crucial condition for the initiation of insurance is an annual income exceeding €6,078. Below this threshold, mandatory insurance ceases. The proposal also includes a temporary measure to freeze increases in meal and travel allowances until the end of 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_160" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_160" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_160" style="display:none;"></p>

This applies to tax losses that have not yet been utilized and for which the right to claim them has not expired. The deduction is available to legal or natural persons who reported a positive tax base for the 2019 calendar tax year.<br><br>Taxpayers can claim these tax losses in their tax return filed between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, with a maximum aggregate deduction of €1 million. Taxpayers with a fiscal year ending on or after October 31, 2019, can also utilize this deduction, up to €1 million. However, this does not apply to fiscal years where the tax return filing deadline falls on December 31, 2019. Taxpayers who have already filed their 2019 tax return can use an amended or additional tax return.<br><br>Tax losses are deducted sequentially, starting with the earliest reported loss. For example, if losses were incurred from 2015 to 2018, the taxpayer would deduct a quarter of the 2015 loss, then the 2016 loss, the 2017 loss, and finally the 2018 loss, up to the calculated tax base and a maximum of €1 million. Keeping records is essential for claiming remaining losses in subsequent periods. This special deduction is optional, and taxpayers can opt for the standard loss amortization method if it is more advantageous.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_161" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_161" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_161" style="display:none;"></p>

Funds received from tax assignments for pandemic relief can now be used until the end of 2021. Unused tax losses from 2015-2018 can be deducted from the tax base for returns filed in 2020, up to a maximum of €1 million. The legislation also clarifies provisions regarding missed deadlines, tax audits, penalties, and the non-publication of VAT payers deregistered due to repeated non-compliance during the pandemic. Municipalities will be allowed to use development fees for current expenses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_162" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_162" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_162" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_164" style="display:none;">Law no. 67/2020 Coll. introduced a special deadline for filing corporate income tax returns for 2019. The deadline, which expired or will expire during the pandemic period, has been extended to the end of the calendar month following the end of the pandemic. Taxpayers must also pay their 2019 income tax by this new deadline.<br><br>This postponement also affects advance tax payments. Under current regulations, advance payments for a given tax period are based on the tax liability declared in the previous year's return (i.e., for 2018). Therefore, taxpayers whose 2019 filing deadline fell within the pandemic period (from March 12, 2020) will continue to pay advances based on their 2018 tax liability until the new extended deadline. This applies even to those who filed their returns by the original March 31 deadline.<br><br>It is important to note that interest on late advance payments made during the pandemic period will be charged according to Section 156 of the Tax Procedure Code.<br><br>A government amendment approved on April 16, 2020, introduced a provision allowing for the suspension of advance tax payments. This applies to periods immediately following a quarter in which a taxpayer's revenue decreased by at least 40% compared to the same period in the previous year. To utilize this provision, taxpayers must submit a declaration confirming they meet the conditions no later than 15 days before the advance payment deadline.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_164" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_164" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_164" style="display:none;"></p>

The law establishes a "pandemic period," starting from March 12, 2020, until the government lifts the state of emergency.<br><br>Key tax provisions include the extension of deadlines for submitting tax returns, notifications, and tax payments for various cases, including the 2019 income tax return, corporate income tax for economic year-endings during the pandemic, and tax returns for deceased taxpayers or those closing permanent establishments. Employers' deadlines for tax reconciliation statements are also extended.<br><br>In accounting, deadlines for fulfilling obligations and submitting financial statements to the accounting register are extended to three months after the pandemic period ends or the tax return deadline, whichever is earlier.<br><br>The legislation allows recipients of designated tax shares (third sector) to use funds to alleviate pandemic consequences. It also exempts imported goods supporting disaster victims from customs duties and VAT. Taxpayer lists and VAT registrations of those violating obligations will not be updated during the pandemic. Tax audits and proceedings are suspended unless they involve financial refunds. Tax executions are postponed, and missed deadlines can be rectified by the end of the month following the pandemic's end. Administrative fees for pandemic-related actions are waived.<br><br>Financial market measures include state-backed loans and interest subsidies for SMEs through the Export-Import Bank of Slovakia and the Slovak Guarantee and Development Bank. Budgetary rule measures permit local governments to use reserve funds, capital revenues, and loans for current expenditures until the end of 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_165" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_165" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_165" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_168" style="display:none;">Based on information from the Press Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic on March 16, 2020, the following proposals for measures, requiring legislative changes and future government/parliamentary decisions, were presented following discussions with business associations:<br><br>Discussions with banks are underway regarding the possibility of deferring loan and mortgage payments without negative credit reporting for borrowers. This includes freezing interest and principal payments for both individuals and legal entities.<br><br>Simplification and attractiveness of short-term preferential loans for businesses in selected sectors will be facilitated through the Slovak Guarantee and Development Bank (SZRB). Inspired by Germany, financial support for private sector investments, potentially via the Slovak Investment Holding (SIH) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), is proposed. This includes introducing systematic support for business investments in fixed assets through a "tax super-deduction" and accelerated depreciation. Adjustments to tax loss carryforward rules are also planned.<br><br>A postponement of tax return submission for all taxpayers from March 31 to June 30, 2020, is proposed, even for those who filed on time. The deadline for VAT payments will be extended, and penalties for late payments will be waived. Self-employed individuals will see a temporary cancellation of social and health contributions for three months (March-May), with these payments to be spread over the following 18 months. Payments to employees will be exempt from social, health contributions, and income tax.<br><br>Conditions for maintaining employment support will be radically simplified, including for small businesses and sole traders. The state budget will finance costs for supported electricity generation technologies for a defined period. The EU will be lobbied to allow the use of current ESIF funds to cover crisis impacts and economic recovery, initiating timely measures and rules. Changes to sickness benefit (OČR) conditions are also anticipated. Payment deadlines for customs debt will be extended by 30-40 days. Companies will not face penalties for failing to meet obligations like public tenders on time, and supervisory activities on businesses will be limited.<br><br>A state of emergency came into effect on March 16, 2020, at 6:00 AM, leading to the closure of most retail and service outlets, with exceptions for essential goods and services. Individuals returning from abroad are mandated to undergo 14-day isolation.<br><br>A summary of the measures implemented by the Central Crisis Staff and the Government is available.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_168" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_168" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_168" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_169" style="display:none;">To manage this situation, the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic has prepared a proposal of measures aimed at supporting the economy. These measures are designed to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on businesses and employees. The core purpose is to rapidly enhance the financial health, liquidity, and cash flow of businesses and workers, prevent the collapse of the business environment, and maintain critical processes essential for managing the virus spread, all while ensuring stability and minimizing panic.<br><br>The proposal outlines 31 measures categorized into four areas. Immediately implementable measures include short-term interest-free loans, deferrals of tax filing and payment deadlines to June 30, 2020, and extended deadlines for tax audits. Interest on delayed income tax prepayments will be waived if paid by year-end. A three-month deferral of social and health insurance contributions is proposed for companies and self-employed individuals from March to June 2020. Wages will be exempt from social, health, and income taxes for employers unable to assign work due to closures. Import duty payment deadlines will also be extended.<br><br>Measures requiring legislative changes include modifying conditions for sickness benefits, introducing "quarantine incapacity for work," and simplifying support for job retention for SMEs and the self-employed. Other measures focus on business prevention and procedures, such as a chatbot for entrepreneurs and extended storage times for postal packages. To foster economic recovery, the proposal suggests removing limitations on tax loss carryforwards and promoting private sector investment through accelerated depreciation and specific financial instruments.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_169" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_169" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_169" style="display:none;"></p>

The main objective of this new legislation is to mitigate bureaucratic processes across all government departments in response to the current situation. Specifically, the measures stipulate that deadlines established by legal regulations in private law relationships, from March 12, 2020, to April 30, 2020, will not run.<br><br>This law was enacted to address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has necessitated adjustments to legal and administrative timelines. By suspending the running of deadlines, the government seeks to provide relief to individuals and businesses by preventing the loss of rights or obligations due to the extraordinary circumstances. The aim is to ensure that the pandemic does not unduly hinder legal proceedings or the management of private affairs. The intention is to ease the burden of adhering to strict deadlines during a period of widespread disruption and uncertainty.<br><br>On March 26, 2020, Parliament passed a law enacting extraordinary measures in response to COVID-19, with a focus on suspending legal deadlines. The primary goal of this legislation is to streamline bureaucratic processes across all sectors given the prevailing circumstances. The enacted measures dictate that legal deadlines within private law relationships, established from March 12, 2020, to April 30, 2020, will be paused. This initiative aims to alleviate administrative burdens and prevent the expiration of rights and obligations during the pandemic, thereby offering a necessary buffer for individuals and businesses facing unprecedented challenges. The law serves as a critical tool to maintain functionality within the legal system and across various government departments amidst the global health crisis.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_171" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_171" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_171" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_172" style="display:none;">Preventive Measures by the Employer<br><br>In accordance with the law, employers must implement general prevention principles for occupational safety and health, including providing information, education, and organizing work and resources. To mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spread, employers must assess workplace risks and take appropriate measures. These may include canceling business trips and events, ensuring hygiene facilities, educating employees, minimizing workplace visitors, isolating at-risk employees, ordering medical check-ups, and allowing remote work. Employers are also entitled to require employees to report their whereabouts in risk areas or other health-relevant information, even if it pertains to private life, as the interest in ensuring workplace health and safety prevails. If an employer knows an employee has returned from an affected country or been in contact with an infected person and continues to work, they can order an extraordinary medical examination to detect the virus, which the employee must undergo. In companies with employee representatives, these measures must first be discussed with them.<br><br>Quarantine<br><br>The Central Crisis Staff mandates a 14-day isolation for all individuals returning from abroad in designated facilities. Employees returning from affected countries without symptoms must monitor their health for 14 days and inform their employer of their return. Voluntary home isolation for 14 days is also an option for symptomatic employees. Employees not in risk areas or showing symptoms cannot arbitrarily stop working unless they arrange for leave or remote work with their employer. Unexcused absence is a breach of discipline.<br><br>Two types of quarantine exist: Mandatory and Voluntary. For mandatory quarantine ordered by public health authorities, the employer must excuse the absence and can reassign the employee to different work or location, including home office, without the employee's consent. If no alternative work is available, it constitutes a hindrance to work on the employee's side, which the employee must prove. Medical institutions must confirm such hindrances. During mandatory quarantine, employees are considered temporarily unable to work and are entitled to income replacement from the employer for the first 10 days, followed by sickness benefits. For voluntary quarantine due to suspicion of infection but without symptoms, employers can grant leave with or without wage replacement, or employees can use their vacation days.<br><br>Employer Options and Employee Entitlements<br><br>Employers can offer excused absences for temporary incapacity due to quarantine or caring for family members, but without wage replacement. Remote work ("home office") is only possible if agreed upon in company regulations or employment contracts, requiring written amendment if not initially included. For essential health measures, deviations can be documented via email. Home office can also reduce on-site staff density. Employers can order employees to take vacation with 14 days' notice, which can be shortened with employee consent in exceptional circumstances. Similarly, compensatory time off can be arranged, usually by agreement. Shift schedules must be announced at least a week in advance, but changes may require individual assessment of employment documentation. Employers can also grant paid or unpaid leave for other reasons, to be worked later. In cases where employers prevent at-risk employees from working or close facilities to prevent virus spread, it's considered a hindrance on the employer's side, entitling employees to average wage compensation, unless an agreement with employee representatives specifies otherwise. This also applies if production is temporarily halted due to external business circumstances. An agreement with employee representatives on serious operational reasons can allow for reduced wage compensation (at least 60% of average earnings), potentially saving employers up to 40% in wage replacement costs. These measures can be implemented proactively by employers to prevent infection spread, even without confirmed cases. Further advice on mitigating economic impacts is available upon contact.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_172" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_172" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_172" style="display:none;"></p>

This change primarily affects foreign entities without a Slovak VAT establishment (registered under Article 5) who qualify for a complete VAT refund.<br><br>Such foreign entities are now obligated to file a VAT return even for exempt acquisitions, reporting it on line 15 as an exempt supply, rather than declaring it as a taxable transaction and claiming an offset as previously done. This shift simplifies reporting while maintaining a neutral impact on the entity's overall tax liability. For instance, a foreign entity moving goods to Slovakia for exclusive supply to Slovak taxable persons, where VAT is reversed, qualifies for this exemption and must report the goods on line 15 of their VAT return.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_173" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_173" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_173" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_174" style="display:none;">Changes in Corporate Income Tax Advance Payments from January 1, 2020<br><br>Effective January 1, 2020, several changes were introduced regarding corporate income tax advance payments. The lower threshold for quarterly advance payments increased from €2,500 to €5,000. All calculations are now rounded mathematically to two decimal places.<br><br>The method for calculating advance tax payments has been altered. Previously, the tax for the preceding period used to determine advance payments was reduced by reliefs from the Corporate Income Tax Act, foreign tax credits, and tax withheld at source. From January 1, 2020, this calculation is reduced only by reliefs stipulated by the Act. The tax rate used for advance payment calculations is now based on the rate applicable in the period immediately preceding the advance payment period, not the current period as before.<br><br>For advance payments due before the tax return filing deadline for 2019, the "last known tax liability" is calculated based on the 2018 tax return, excluding items like foreign tax credits and withholding tax deductions, and was rounded down. Advance payments due after the 2019 tax return filing deadline are based on the 2019 tax return using the revised calculation method.<br><br>New entities now have until the end of the month following the tax return deadline to settle their advance payments, a change from the previous requirement to settle by the tax return deadline itself.<br><br>For self-employed individuals, the €5,000 threshold for advance payments also applies, but the calculation changes take effect after the 2020 tax return filing deadline. The "last known tax liability" for self-employed individuals is now calculated using a 19% tax rate on partial taxable income from specific sources (sections 6(1) and 6(2)), reduced by tax loss. It no longer includes income from employment, rental income, or income from works/performances, nor does it consider non-taxable amounts or tax bonuses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_174" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_174" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_174" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_175" style="display:none;">The amendment to the law on vehicle operation and road traffic, effective January 1, 2020, introduces significant changes to the motor vehicle tax law. These updates, particularly concerning the definition of "business use" of a vehicle, will impact all entrepreneurs liable for this tax from that date. "Business use" is now broadly defined, including actual business use, accounting for the vehicle, inclusion in tax records, claiming related expenses, or use by an employee receiving travel allowances for non-business purposes. This means a vehicle can become subject to tax even before its actual business use, for instance, upon its inclusion in company assets.<br><br>Vehicles with special registration numbers (M for new/test vehicles, H for historic, S for sports) are now exempt from tax. The law also clarifies the timing of tax liability changes, ensuring no double taxation within a calendar year. Tax liability now ceases on the last day of the month of the event causing cessation, and new liability begins on the first day of the following month. The law also expands the reasons for tax cessation to include vehicle theft, confirmed by police. Furthermore, the tax period for businesses that temporarily suspend operations now ends on the last day of the month of suspension, with tax returns due within one month. For deceased taxpayers, the tax period ends on the last day of the month of death.<br><br>Other changes include a penalty for violating tax exemption conditions, a minimum tax payment threshold of 5 euros, and updated annual tax rates based on vehicle age, with reductions for hybrid, CNG, LNG, and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Advance tax payments are now calculated based on projected annual tax liability.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_175" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_175" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_175" style="display:none;"></p>

Inactive companies will be deleted, and required data will be updated. Specifically, the duration of legal entities will be recorded, and shareholders' dates of birth and identification numbers will be mandatory entries, requiring companies to update this information by September 30, 2021. Real estate used as a registered office will require a written consent with an officially certified signature from the property owner.<br><br>Foreign individuals conducting business in Slovakia will now require a trade license. Companies facing insolvency, indicated by a low equity-to-liability ratio, will be classified as companies in crisis, with an expanded definition including companies between dissolution and liquidation. Failure to file accounting statements for over six months will be grounds for court-ordered company dissolution. The liquidation process is being more strictly regulated, with a mandatory advance payment for the liquidator's fees and expenses. Additional liquidation will be introduced for companies found to possess assets after deregistration. Furthermore, significant asset transactions for dissolved companies will require expert appraisal and approval from the highest company body. These changes, largely effective from October 1, 2020, aim to formalize processes and ensure data accuracy within the Commercial Register.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_176" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_176" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_176" style="display:none;"></p>

Originally focused on minimum wage rates, the directive now mandates comparable working and remuneration conditions for foreign workers posted to Slovakia.<br><br>Specifically, host employers must now ensure that posted employees receive not only the minimum wage but also various mandatory wage components and allowances, including overtime pay, holiday pay, weekend pay, night work allowances, compensation for difficult working conditions, and other mandatory components stipulated by higher-level collective agreements. Furthermore, the directive clarifies that compensation for travel expenses, accommodation, and meals during business trips or commutes within Slovakia must be provided in accordance with Slovak law or applicable collective agreements. These allowances can be offset by comparable benefits provided by the posting employer under the laws of their home country.<br><br>The directive also introduces a distinction based on the duration of posting: short-term postings (up to 12 or 18 months) will apply the core conditions, while long-term postings (over 12 or 18 months) will generally require compliance with all Slovak labor law, with specific exceptions related to the commencement and termination of employment contracts and non-competition clauses. New information obligations for user employers regarding temporary employers are also introduced, along with rules for calculating posting periods in cases of successive postings.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_177" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_177" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_177" style="display:none;"></p>

It emphasizes that selling a company is a rare and demanding event, both time-wise and psychologically.<br><br>Experts advise selling when the company is growing, profitable, and well-capitalized, not during a downturn. Common reasons for selling include lifestyle changes, retirement, lack of successors, or reinvesting capital. Crucially, sellers must ensure meticulous accounting, management reports, and market knowledge. Legal preparation is also vital to ensure swift payment and minimize seller liability for hidden debts, while buyers often prioritize non-compete clauses.<br><br>Company valuation methods include income-based (future cash flows) and asset-based (market value minus liabilities), chosen based on purpose and company type. Finding serious investors requires discretion, with platforms like ČSOB Match'it offering a secure, verified environment for connecting businesses with investors, ensuring anonymity and data protection through non-disclosure agreements and verified user access. Legal documentation, including non-disclosure agreements, letters of intent, and transaction agreements, is essential, with its complexity depending on the deal structure (share deal vs. asset deal). Both share and asset deals carry unique risks, such as undisclosed liabilities in share deals or the need for new licenses in asset deals.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_181" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_181" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_181" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_182" style="display:none;">A draft amendment to the Tax Administration Act (Tax Code) is currently undergoing interdepartmental review, proposing several significant changes. Key alterations include clarifying the definition of a taxpayer to include organizational units of associations acting in their own name, and allowing tax administrators to waive official translations of submitted documents to reduce administrative burden. New rules will govern the replacement of overlapping powers of attorney, ensuring a new one supersedes the old where conflicts arise. For electronically mandated communicators, submissions made outside the official electronic portal will require correction before being considered filed. Taxpayers will be barred from filing tax returns for periods where tax was assessed by proxy if they fail to comply with requests. Taxpayers will need to prove facts requested by tax administrators not just during audits but in all tax administration processes. Electronic delivery will be refined to target those with accessible electronic services, those requesting it, and voluntarily registered users. Tax audit reports will no longer require the reason for commencement to avoid compromising investigations based on external tips. The scope of tax audits can be expanded to include other laws, and protocol delivery will integrate the tax assessment notice. The start date for tax assessment by proxy will be the day after notification. Notifications for payment reallocations or overpayments below €5 will be discontinued for efficiency. Decisions on tax deferral or installment payments will be automatically voided if the original tax assessment is annulled. The period during which deferral or installment payments are disallowed due to non-compliance will be reduced from five to two years. Null decisions will include those issued after the right to assess tax has expired. The obligation for individuals and legal entities to report bank account numbers will be removed, as payment service providers already supply this information. Tax assessment decisions must be issued within three months of the expression of opinion on the protocol. The deadline for forwarding appeals will commence after the appeal submission period ends or upon the taxpayer’s supplementation of the appeal. Tax overpayments will be refunded to specified accounts, with provisions for cases where accounts are not provided or known. The moment of creation for a tax administrator's lien will be tied to its enforceability, with immediate notification to debtors and relevant registers. The statute of limitations for tax debt recovery will be aligned with bankruptcy law, with a ten-year extension after the annulment of debt relief. Tax execution will be suspended when a court application is filed to exclude assets until a final court decision. Electronic communication with banks will be implemented for expanded garnishments. A new tax execution method, driver's license seizure, will be introduced, excluding professional drivers. Specific times for vehicle presentation during movable property sales will be defined to prevent execution obstruction. The period for paying execution costs will start upon the delivery of the tax administrator's decision. Fines for non-compliance with non-monetary obligations will have a lowered minimum. The calculation of fines for assessments made by tax assessment orders will be defined. Fines will not be levied if a supplementary tax return reduces a previously claimed tax refund or entitlement before it has been processed.<br><br>A proposed amendment to the Tax Administration Act aims to streamline tax processes with several key changes. It clarifies taxpayer definitions, allows for waiving official translations of documents, and modifies rules for powers of attorney, ensuring new ones supersede conflicting older versions. Submissions by those required to communicate electronically must be made via the official portal or corrected. Taxpayers failing to comply with requests after tax assessment by proxy will be barred from filing subsequent returns. Taxpayers must provide evidence requested by tax administrators in all instances, not just during audits. Electronic delivery will be refined for specific user groups. Tax audit reports will no longer require the reason for commencement, and audit scope can be broadened. The process for tax assessment by proxy will have a defined start date. Notifications for minor payment reallocations or overpayments will be eliminated for efficiency. Decisions on tax deferral or installment payments will be automatically voided if the original tax assessment is annulled, with a reduced penalty period for non-compliance. Null decisions will encompass those issued after the assessment right has expired. The reporting of bank account numbers will be removed from taxpayer obligations. Tax assessment decisions will have a three-month deadline. Appeal forwarding rules will be adjusted for timeliness. Overpayments will be refunded to specified accounts. Tax administrator liens will be based on enforceability. Statute of limitations for tax debt recovery will align with bankruptcy law. Tax execution will be suspended if assets are challenged in court. Driver's license seizure will be introduced as a tax execution method. Specifics for vehicle presentation during sales and cost payment periods will be clarified. Fines for non-compliance will have lower minimums, and fines will not apply for certain corrective tax returns.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_182" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_182" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_182" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_183" style="display:none;">Does your company provide fuel cards for its subsidiaries or companies within the group? This newsletter informs you about the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union No. C-235/18 Vega International Car Transport and Logistic, in which the Court ruled that providing fuel cards by a parent company to its subsidiaries, enabling them to refuel vehicles they use for transport, can be classified as a service of granting credit, which is exempt from VAT.<br><br>For example: A parent company provides fuel cards to its subsidiaries based on an agreement with a fuel supplier. The subsidiaries use these cards to fuel vehicles owned by them. The parent company receives a monthly invoice for all fuel card transactions, claims input VAT on the fuel, and then re-invoices the fuel to its subsidiaries with a 2% markup. According to the judgment, the parent company is not entitled to deduct VAT because it doesn't have ownership rights over the fuel, like a true owner. The subsidiary directly purchases the fuel and makes all decisions regarding the purchase conditions. The re-invoicing of the fuel is not considered a sale of fuel by the parent company, as the supply of fuel was not made for the benefit of the parent company. The parent company only has an intermediary role through the fuel cards. Therefore, the parent company is providing a financial service similar to granting credit, which is VAT-exempt.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_183" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_183" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_183" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_184" style="display:none;">On June 26, 2019, the National Council of the Slovak Republic approved in the first reading a bill amending the VAT Act. The proposal suggests extending the reduced VAT rate of 10% to all foodstuffs, excluding beverages, sweets, food additives, flavorings, nutritional supplements, and confectionery. This change, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2020.<br><br>On the same day, another bill was approved in the first reading, supplementing Annex No. 7 of the VAT Act, which defines the list of goods with a reduced tax rate. This proposal aims to introduce a reduced tax rate on newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, including those illustrated or containing advertising material. However, the reduced rate will not apply if advertising content constitutes more than 50% or erotic content exceeds 10% of the total content. This change would also take effect on January 1, 2020, if approved.<br><br>Currently, interdepartmental review is underway for a government-proposed amendment to the VAT Act, introducing several changes, including a new "CALL-OFF STOCK" regime for the supply of goods. This regime regulates the transfer of goods by a taxable person from Slovakia to another member state for subsequent delivery to a pre-known customer. Conditions include the goods being sent by the VAT payer, the payer not having a seat or establishment in the destination member state, the recipient being VAT-identified in that state, the payer recording the transfer, and including the recipient's VAT number in a summary statement. The amendment also clarifies conditions to differentiate the "CALL-OFF STOCK" regime from a standard supply of goods, particularly the requirement for the goods to be transferred to the buyer within 12 months.<br><br>Further amendments address record-keeping obligations under the "CALL-OFF STOCK" regime, summary statements, assignment of transport in EU chain transactions, VAT reduction for gratuitous transfers of assets up to EUR 1,700, changes to conditions for VAT exemption on goods supplied to the EU, correction of deducted tax on services performed on investment property, and adjustment of deducted VAT on movable investment property sold within five years of acquisition. These amendments also aim to clarify documentary evidence for VAT exemption on intra-EU supplies and consequences of incorrect summary statements.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_184" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_184" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_184" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_185" style="display:none;">The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act introduces several changes, most notably the concept of a "micro-taxpayer," defined as a physical or legal entity with income/revenue not exceeding EUR 49,790 (the VAT registration threshold). Micro-taxpayers benefit from advantageous depreciation rules for leased tangible assets, allowing them to include depreciation in tax expenses regardless of rental income. They can also freely determine the depreciation amount for assets in depreciation groups 0-4, up to the initial cost (excluding cars over EUR 48,000), but cannot interrupt depreciation. If an asset is disposed of before full depreciation, the tax base must be increased by the difference between claimed and standard depreciation.<br><br>Micro-taxpayers using double-entry bookkeeping can also deduct the creation of provisions for receivables in line with their accounting records. The amendment introduces a new depreciation group (0) for electric vehicles with a 2-year depreciation period. The loss carryforward period is extended from four to five years, limited to 50% of the tax base (except for micro-taxpayers).<br><br>Simplifications are proposed for employee tax allowances, requiring a declaration only upon employment and when conditions change. The amendment also changes rules regarding expenses deductible only upon payment, where the payment condition is not necessary if expenses are part of the asset acquisition cost. However, consultancy services and management fees will only be deductible after payment. The threshold for mandatory advance tax payments increases from EUR 2,500 to EUR 5,000. Employers' transportation contributions are tax-free up to EUR 60 monthly. The non-statute-barred status of receivables is assessed at the end of the tax period. Super deduction for R&D expenses increases to 200%. New provisions address hybrid mismatches to prevent undue tax advantages. Furthermore, income from capital funds of contributions are added to the source of income from the territory of the Slovak Republic.<br><br>The amount of meal allowance increased from 1 July 2019.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_185" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_185" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_185" style="display:none;"></p>

The amendment suggests increasing the size criteria for audit obligation. The total assets threshold is raised from EUR 1,000,000 to EUR 2,000,000, and the net turnover threshold from EUR 2,000,000 to EUR 4,000,000.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_187" style="display:none;">The "Quick Fixes" aim to standardize VAT rules for B2B goods transactions within the EU, with the Czech Republic already implementing EU legislation into its VAT law. Significant changes in the Czech Republic will primarily affect the handling of goods under the call-off stock regime. Other changes mainly clarify existing practices.<br><br>The Quick Fixes, based on EU Directives 2018/1910 and 2018/1912, cover: call-off stock, assigning transport in chain transactions, verifying customer VAT IDs via VIES, and proving VAT exemption for intra-community supplies.<br><br>Regarding call-off stock, current Czech law has a brief paragraph interpreted by a 2004 agreement between tax advisors and the tax administration. This interpretation involves a known customer with a Czech VAT ID, with the fiction of acquisition occurring upon warehousing and subsequent withdrawals not considered taxable. The VAT due date follows standard principles. From January 1, 2020, the new legislation will require the supplier to be registered for VAT for intra-community supplies abroad, with a known Czech customer holding a VAT ID. The supplier will report the transfer in a summary report, and both parties must maintain records according to EU law. The customer declares the acquisition in their VAT return upon withdrawal, within 12 months. Violations result in the supplier conducting a taxable transfer in the Czech Republic.<br><br>For chain transactions, current Czech law lacks specific rules, leading to disputes and potential fraud. From January 1, 2020, EU rules will apply, assigning transport to the transaction between the supplier and intermediary, unless the intermediary provides their VAT ID from the dispatching member state, shifting the transport assignment to the intermediary's supply.<br><br>Verifying VAT IDs via VIES is already a substantive condition in the Czech Republic for VAT exemption on intra-community supplies. This practice will continue unchanged from January 1, 2020.<br><br>Currently, proving VAT exemption relies on Czech case law, with a purchaser's declaration serving as supporting evidence. Accepted evidence includes transport documents like CMR. High-risk deliveries, especially with supplier or customer transport, require caution. From January 1, 2020, the Czech tax administration will accept the documents listed in European legislation for proof of transport.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_187" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_187" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_187" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_188" style="display:none;">On December 4, 2018, the EU Council of Finance Ministers approved "quick fixes" regarding chain transactions, to be implemented within Article 36a of the VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC). These rules do not apply to transactions with third (non-EU) countries.<br><br>A chain transaction involves multiple successive supplies with at least three parties, where goods are directly transported from the first supplier to the final customer. Only one physical movement of goods occurs, implying only one transport. Besides the supply linked to the transport, at least one other supply exists in each chain transaction, not connected to the physical movement. The new adjustments focus on intra-community chain transactions initiated by an intermediary.<br><br>Previously, VAT interpretation issues arose. Article 36a aims to provide greater legal certainty due to inconsistencies in national regulations and incomplete international or supranational rules.<br><br>The new regulation defines a chain transaction as described above. Article 36a of the VAT Directive aligns with existing Austrian methodology. Generally, transport is attributed to the party initiating it. However, the intermediary has the option to influence this attribution. If the intermediary initiates the supply, the transport is generally attributed to them. However, if the intermediary acts with a VAT ID from the country of dispatch, the transport is attributed to the supply from the intermediary to the final customer.<br><br>The new regulation only offers legal certainty when the intermediary initiates transport. Otherwise, legal interpretation remains inconsistent. If the first or last customer initiates transport, transport attribution must follow established case law. The main point of contention remains determining where the right to dispose of the goods transfers to the final customer. While Article 36a (Directive 2006/112/ES) improves legal certainty, a comprehensive regulation covering all possible chain transaction scenarios (at least within the intra-community area) would be desirable.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_188" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_188" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_188" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_189" style="display:none;">The JStG 2018 law necessitates the implementation of "quick fix" measures, approved in December 2018 at the European level, into national law by January 1, 2020. These measures aim to facilitate intra-community trade until a definitive VAT system based on the destination principle is established. The quick fixes, effective from January 1, 2020, address consignment stocks and intra-community supplies.<br><br>For consignment stocks, specifically call-off-stock arrangements where a single customer withdraws goods, the new rules, according to Article 17a of the VAT Directive, state that transferring goods to another member state is not equivalent to a taxable supply if certain conditions are met. VAT is only triggered upon withdrawal from the consignment stock, eliminating the supplier's tax obligation in the destination country.<br><br>Regarding intra-community supplies, the VAT Directive now mandates that a valid VAT ID and its communication to the supplier are essential for tax exemption. Failure to submit or accurately complete summary reports (relating to VAT) can jeopardize tax exemption unless the supplier can justify the omission to the authorities. Additionally, proving an intra-community supply requires at least two non-contradictory documents from independent parties like CMR documents or freight invoices.<br><br>These changes necessitate stricter verification of customer VAT IDs, accurate summary reports, and correct invoicing procedures. While the quick fixes provide legal certainty for consignment stocks, businesses claiming VAT exemptions on intra-community supplies face increased evidentiary requirements. The hope remains that the eventual transition to a definitive VAT system will further ease the burden on businesses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_189" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_189" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_189" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_190" style="display:none;">The European Commission approved four VAT "Quick Fixes" at the end of 2018, effective from January 1, 2020, aimed at improving cross-border trade. These fixes address: simplifying call-off stock arrangements, making VAT ID a substantive requirement for VAT exemption, establishing unified criteria for chain transactions, and standardizing proof of transport for intra-community supplies.<br><br>For call-off stock, the changes treat the transfer to a consignment warehouse in another member state for a pre-determined customer as a single supply in the dispatching state and an acquisition in the receiving state, avoiding the need for the supplier to register in the destination country. A valid VAT ID of the recipient becomes a material condition for VAT exemption on intra-community supplies. Lack of a valid VAT ID reported to the supplier disqualifies the zero VAT rate application.<br><br>For chain transactions, new rules determine which supply in the chain is linked to the transport of goods. If a intermediary supplier arranges the transport and is VAT registered in a different member state, the transport is attributed to the supply to that intermediary. Standardized proof of transport is also introduced, requiring suppliers to provide at least two pieces of evidence, such as a signed CMR document or official documents, to demonstrate that goods have moved to another member state. If the recipient organizes the transport, they must provide a written statement to the supplier confirming the transport.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_190" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_190" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_190" style="display:none;"></p>

If your company purchased goods or services from a UK VAT payer in 2019, file for a UK VAT refund well before the UK leaves the EU. Review all intra-group business agreements with the UK, like royalty payments, and assess withholding tax obligations. Scrutinize all contracts and related payments to the UK, such as leases, and evaluate the need for tax security.<br><br>Companies with existing or planned trade relations with the UK should apply for an EORI identifier from the Slovak Financial Directorate. Communicate with business partners to address potential supply chain disruptions. If registered for the VAT Mini One-Stop Shop in the UK, register in another EU member state.<br><br>Assess whether certificates, licenses, or permits issued by UK authorities will remain valid in the EU post-Brexit, particularly in sectors like automotive, healthcare, transport, broadcasting, and finance. Examine supply chains regarding rules of origin, treating UK inputs as non-originating to secure preferential EU origin for your goods.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_193" style="display:none;">The United Kingdom's departure from the EU has been a major topic at the European level for the past two years. A "hard BREXIT" would occur on October 31, 2019, if the UK didn't approve the Withdrawal Agreement or request a longer extension. Without an agreement, the exit will impact citizens, businesses, and authorities in both the UK and the EU, bringing changes to border controls, the validity of licenses, and data transfer conditions.<br><br>Slovak businesses need to prepare, especially in customs and VAT. Without a deal, customs authorities will apply third-country rules to UK trade, including customs declarations and tariffs. Companies trading regularly with the UK can apply for simplified customs procedures. Those new to UK trade require an EORI number. Post-Brexit, inputs from the UK won't count as "EU content" for preferential tariffs.<br><br>For VAT, the UK becomes a third country, impacting buying and selling goods, and VAT refunds for Slovak applicants will follow UK national legislation after Brexit. Businesses using the "MOSS" scheme must register within an EU member state, not the UK.<br><br>In international taxation, the double taxation treaty remains, but UK taxpayers are treated as third-country taxpayers. Notably, exemptions for interest and license fees under the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive will no longer apply. Tax security measures will be implemented, requiring payers to secure 19% of taxable income paid to UK residents. An example illustrates this with rental income paid to a UK property owner, where the Slovak company must secure 19% tax.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_193" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_193" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_193" style="display:none;"></p>

Unlike previous guidelines, the extent of documentation now depends on the type of controlled transaction (significant/insignificant, cross-border/domestic) rather than the type of taxpayer. This means different controlled transactions of the same taxpayer may require different levels of documentation.<br><br>The guideline also addresses documentation requirements for permanent establishments. There are no significant changes regarding specific transfer pricing rules for the public sector.<br><br>The guideline doesn't set a minimum value for defining a significant controlled transaction, referencing the definition of materiality in accounting law and IFRS standards. The previous minimum value of EUR 1,000,000, above which transactions had to be described in the documentation, has been removed.<br><br>A standardized form for abbreviated documentation is included in the guideline's appendix. Full or basic documentation is prepared separately for each controlled transaction or jointly for a group of transactions, with reasons for grouping provided. Documentation is kept for the relevant tax period.<br><br>This guideline applies to documentation submitted for tax periods beginning after December 31, 2017. Taxpayers can follow the 2016 guideline until June 30, 2019.<br>Controlled transaction types determine the required documentation type, with categories like significant cross-border transactions requiring full documentation, while others necessitate basic or abbreviated versions.<br><br>The new guideline significantly changes documentation requirements, particularly affecting small and medium-sized enterprises. While it sets the minimum documentation scope, tax authorities can request additional information. Taxpayers should still verify prices align with the arm's length principle to limit tax risks during audits, even if transfer pricing documentation isn't mandatory in some cases.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_195" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_195" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_195" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_200" style="display:none;">The current definition of turnover uses the terms "income" and "revenue," creating unequal conditions for taxable persons using double-entry bookkeeping versus those using single-entry bookkeeping. These terms are replaced by "value of supplied goods and services," meaning turnover will include the value of supplied goods and services as per Section 22, Paragraph 1 of the VAT Act at the time of their supply.<br><br>According to the new definition in the VAT Act, even for taxable persons keeping single-entry accounts, payments received before the supply of goods or services will not be included in turnover. These received "advance payments" constitute part of the value of the goods or services and will be included in turnover for the calendar month in which the goods or services were supplied.<br><br>In conjunction with the change in definition, Section 50, Paragraph 2 (Calculation of the Coefficient) replaces the terms revenue (income) excluding tax with the terms value excluding tax of supplied goods and services.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>A new definition of turnover under the VAT Act aims to level the playing field for businesses. Previously, terms like "income" and "revenue" created disparities between double-entry and single-entry bookkeeping. The revised definition centers on the "value of supplied goods and services" at the time of supply. This clarification means advance payments received before goods or services are delivered will not be counted towards turnover until the actual supply occurs. This change also impacts the calculation of the coefficient, where "revenue (income) excluding tax" is now replaced by "value excluding tax of supplied goods and services."</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_200" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_200" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_200" style="display:none;"></p>

A voucher is defined as a physical or electronic instrument that grants the holder the right to receive goods or services, while obligating the supplier to accept it as consideration for those goods or services.<br><br>The proposed amendment distinguishes between single-purpose and multi-purpose vouchers, based on whether the specific goods or services the voucher can be exchanged for are known in advance. This classification aims to correctly determine when tax liability arises – either upon the voucher's issuance or upon the actual supply of goods or services in exchange for it. These changes apply to vouchers issued after December 31, 2018. The rules do not cover discount vouchers, which offer a reduction on a purchase but do not grant the right to receive goods or services in exchange for the voucher itself.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_201" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_201" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_201" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_203" style="display:none;">A significant change in the VAT Act concerns the VAT regime for the supply of buildings and the rental of real estate, as well as a redefined definition of initial building approval (kolaudácia).<br><br>Currently, the supply of a building or its part, including the land it stands on, is exempt from VAT if it occurs more than five years after the initial building approval. Under the current law, VAT payers had the option to choose whether to tax the supply, but the amendment removes this discretionary power. The amendment introduces new events that trigger the five-year period during which the supply of a part of a building (apartment, non-residential space) is mandatorily subject to VAT. After this period, VAT payers must exempt the supply of residential buildings from VAT. If a residential property is sold after five years but before the period for adjusting deducted VAT (20 years), the VAT payer must adjust the VAT deducted from the property's acquisition.<br><br>The amendment also changes the rules for taxing rental properties, making VAT exemption mandatory for residential property rentals, regardless of the tenant's status. This applies to all lease agreements concluded after December 31, 2018, for properties handed over for use after that date.<br><br>Furthermore, the amendment broadens the definition of initial building approval to include not only the approval for the initial use of the building but also approvals for changes in the building's intended use and approvals for using the building after construction work significantly altering its existing use. A dividing criterion is set at 40% of the building's market value before the reconstruction, considering location and time. VAT exemption is possible five years after the kolaudácia related to the change of use or reconstruction.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>The Slovak VAT Act has been amended to change the VAT rules concerning the supply and rental of real estate. Key changes include making VAT exemption mandatory for residential property rentals and supplies occurring more than five years after initial building approval (kolaudácia). The amendment removes the VAT payer's discretionary power to tax the supply of buildings after this five-year period. It also clarifies the start of this five-year period, including situations involving changes in the building's intended use or significant renovations. The definition of "kolaudácia" is expanded to encompass these changes of use or renovations if they represent at least 40% of the property's pre-renovation market value. If residential property is sold after 5 years but before 20 years(VAT adjustment period), the VAT payer must adjust the VAT deducted from the property's acquisition. These changes aim to provide clearer and more consistent VAT treatment for real estate transactions and rentals in Slovakia. The changes in rental property taxation apply to agreements from 2019 onward.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_203" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_203" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_203" style="display:none;"></p>

Key changes include capping deductible "excess borrowing costs" at the higher of €3 million or 30% of adjusted taxable income (EBITDA). A safe-harbor provision allows for the deduction of 75% of excess borrowing costs exceeding the limit if the company's equity ratio equals or exceeds its consolidated group's. A new thin capitalization rule limits deductibility to the higher of 10% of EBITDA or €1 million if related-party debt exceeds 1.5 times equity.<br><br>Taxpayers can carry forward disallowed excess borrowing costs indefinitely and unused interest capacity for up to five years. These rules also apply to French tax groups under certain conditions, affecting periods starting January 1, 2019, including interest on pre-existing loans.<br><br>Article 48 introduces a general anti-abuse rule for corporate income tax, disallowing arrangements with the main purpose of obtaining a tax advantage contrary to the law's intent. This implements the ATAD's general anti-abuse rule, enabling tax authorities to challenge arrangements aimed primarily at tax benefits without needing to prove exclusive tax avoidance intent. This clause is also effective for periods beginning January 1, 2019.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_212" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_212" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_212" style="display:none;"></p>

Consequently, a CFC rule was introduced into Austrian corporate tax law, applicable to profits realized after January 1, 2019, exempting companies with passive income not exceeding one-third of their taxable income and setting a de minimis threshold for low-profit companies. The rule applies if passive income is taxed below 12.5%, potentially impacting companies in some EU member states.<br><br>Regarding hybrid mismatches, Austria already restricts deductibility of borrowing costs if the recipient's income is not taxed at a minimum of 10% and disallows tax exemptions on dividends if the dividend payment is a deductible expense for the subsidiary.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_215" style="display:none;">In recent years, tax law has faced strong legislative pressure, mainly from the EU and OECD, aiming to combat aggressive tax practices. One recent measure transposes Article 6 of EU Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD), establishing the principle of prohibiting abuse of law in the Czech legal system. Member states have a short time to implement these rules by December 31, 2018.<br><br>Abuse of law involves subjective (taxpayer motivation) and objective (purpose of the law) criteria. The tax administrator assesses whether abuse occurred and bears the burden of proof. The principle should be used as a last resort, not replacing standard tools like price corrections. The Czech Republic's administrative courts have addressed such cases since 2005, with rulings aligning with ATAD's key aspects.<br><br>It's crucial to distinguish abuse of law from dissimulation (where the real intention is hidden). Abuse of law involves intentionally chosen actions without concealment.<br><br>The proposed law, currently in the Chamber of Deputies, incorporates the prohibition into the Tax Code, applying to all tax types to ensure consistency. The proposed wording focuses on actions with the "prevailing purpose" of gaining a tax advantage contrary to the law's intent.

Concerns exist that this principle could be overused by tax administrators, creating uncertainty, and impacting court decisions.

This includes identifying information like name, address, nationality, and ID document details, though this data is not meant for public disclosure. This registration is separate from any obligation to register as a public sector partner. Companies registered before October 31, 2018, must register their UBOs by December 31, 2019. Consulting companies offer assistance with this process.

The new insurance tax will have a uniform eight percent rate, affecting all non-life insurance products, with the exception of mandatory contractual insurance, where the eight percent levy will remain unchanged. A change concerning informational obligations was also agreed upon. Under current legislation, clients must notify an insurance company of their intent to terminate a contract at least six weeks before the end of the insurance period. However, according to members of the finance committee, insurance companies will be required to inform clients ten weeks before the end of the insurance period about the approaching insurance expiry and the rate for the following year.<br><br>This article provides information on a new insurance tax law in Slovakia. The Act, effective from January 1, 2019, introduces an eight percent tax on non-life insurance products. Notably, mandatory contractual insurance remains subject to an eight percent levy.

The new regulations require insurers to inform clients ten weeks in advance about the upcoming insurance period end and the applicable rate for the subsequent year. This change aims to give policyholders more time to consider their options and make informed decisions regarding their insurance coverage.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_218" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_218" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_218" style="display:none;"></p>

In practice, this means the Financial Administration will have immediate information on every transaction, as each issued receipt will be registered in the central eKasa storage. Previously, entrepreneurs had the option to voluntarily connect to the Financial Administration's systems; going forward, connection to the Financial Administration will be mandatory. Electronic registration cash registers (ERP) will become online registration cash registers (ORP). However, entrepreneurs will have more options: a cash register can be not only a classic ERP but also a tablet, mobile phone, computer, or a Virtual Registration Cash Register (VRP).<br><br>The project is expected to bring entrepreneurs reduced administrative burdens and lower costs, while buyers will benefit from increased protection against unreliable entities and, for example, electronic receipts.<br><br>The proposal, subject to approval by the National Council of the Slovak Republic, anticipates a phased implementation.

Entrepreneurs will have flexibility in choosing their cash register solution, including classic ERPs, tablets, mobile phones, computers, or Virtual Registration Cash Registers (VRP). This initiative aims to reduce administrative work and costs for businesses while enhancing consumer protection and offering electronic receipts. The rollout is planned in two phases: the HORECA sector in April 2019 and retail, services, and others in July 2019. The project requires parliamentary approval for implementation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_219" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_219" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_219" style="display:none;"></p>

A significant focus is placed on the true economic substance of these transactions and addressing the issue of thin capitalization or hidden capital. The draft amendment is still under consideration and has not been finalized. This development is crucial for companies engaging in cross-border financial activities, as it seeks to provide clearer guidance on transfer pricing for financial instruments. The aim is to ensure that such transactions are priced appropriately, reflecting arm's length principles and preventing tax base erosion.

Due to digital companies operating across borders without a physical presence, existing tax rules created a mismatch between where taxation occurs and where value is actually created. Therefore, an EU-level solution is necessary to ensure fair taxation of income from modern digitized business models.<br><br>The directive intends to reform corporate income tax rules by expanding the definition of a permanent establishment to include a significant digital presence for corporate income tax purposes. It also establishes principles for attributing profits for tax purposes. The rules within the directive are to be integrated into member states' national systems and the CCCTB directive proposal.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_224" style="display:none;">The French wealth tax, previously levied on individuals with assets over €1.3 million, which had prompted wealthy individuals to leave France, was limited to private real estate ownership from January 1, 2018, and even increased.<br><br>The new Real Estate Wealth Tax ("impôt sur la fortune immobilière" or IFI) largely adopts provisions from the old wealth tax (ISF), including the €1.3 million taxable threshold, a progressive tax rate up to 1.5%, and general valuation criteria. It now taxes both directly and indirectly held real estate more stringently, unless used for economic activity within companies. Private properties owned by companies, in which an IFI taxpayer has an interest, are considered only down to a certain participation level, with the tax base derived from company shares corresponding to directly or indirectly held real estate. Determining these values can be challenging.<br><br>This means that private individuals’ total non-operational real estate holdings are subject to IFI taxation. Other assets, such as liquid assets, movable property, securities, and business stakes, are excluded. Non-residents, who were previously taxed only on French real estate or interests in real estate companies under the old wealth tax, now face an expanded tax base under the new IFI. Loan and liability deduction rules have been significantly modified; for instance, loans from family members and related parties are generally no longer deductible, except under strict exceptions. A prohibition on deducting loans from shareholders remains. Deductions are limited if taxable assets exceed €5 million and loans constitute over 60% of these assets. The practical application of these new regulations will be closely monitored, with assistance available.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_224" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_224" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_224" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_226" style="display:none;">Real estate investments offer stable income, with distinct tax implications for legal entities and individuals in the Czech Republic. International tax treaties generally stipulate that profits from real estate are taxed where the property is located, though specific agreements, like with Germany, may exempt certain transactions in the country of residence.<br><br>Legal entities face a 19% corporate income tax on profits after deductible expenses, with property value depreciated over 30 or 50 years. Strategic structuring can significantly reduce the tax burden across income tax, VAT, and real estate acquisition tax. Selling shares in companies is VAT-exempt, and income is tax-exempt after 12 months of holding. Mergers and spin-offs are generally tax-neutral. A notable cost is the 4% real estate acquisition tax on the purchase price, payable by the buyer, though it can be eliminated in certain corporate restructurings.<br><br>For individuals, rental income is taxed at 15% after expenses, without social or health contributions. Proper structuring can eliminate income tax and VAT on property sales after five years of ownership, and share sales are also tax-exempt after five years, allowing for tax-neutral transfers into holding structures. Property sales or contributions to companies incur the 4% real estate acquisition tax.<br><br>VAT on real estate sales is generally exempt after five years from completion or significant alteration, unless parties agree otherwise. Rent is typically VAT-exempt, though landlords can opt to charge VAT. Input VAT can be reclaimed if output VAT is charged. A 10-year period tracks property usage, affecting previously claimed input VAT deductions.<br><br>Overall, well-structured investments can lead to tax-exempt share sales for legal entities after one year, avoiding VAT and acquisition tax. For individuals, property or share sales can be tax-exempt after five years. International tax implications and technical enhancements require thorough assessment. Transferring property between individuals and legal entities always incurs the 4% real estate acquisition tax.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_226" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_226" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_226" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_227" style="display:none;">When investing directly in real estate in Austria, several tax regulations must be considered.<br><br>**Real Estate Acquisition Tax and Land Registry Fee:** Upon acquiring property, a 3.5% real estate acquisition tax and a 1.1% land registry fee are payable, based on the purchase price.<br><br>**Income Tax:** Rental income from properties is subject to income tax. Taxable income is calculated by deducting proven expenses from rental revenue. This net income is declared in the annual tax return and taxed at Austria's progressive income tax rates. Allowable expenses include depreciation, financing costs, and repair and maintenance costs. A depreciation deduction is applied to the building's portion of the purchase price, spread over its lifespan. Typically, the purchase price is allocated 40% to land and 60% to the building for rental purposes, though exceptions exist. The lifespan for depreciation of income-generating buildings is 66.6 years (1.5% of the tax base).<br><br>**Property Tax:** Property ownership is generally subject to property tax, calculated on the indicative value of the land, which reflects average 1973 land prices plus a 35% surcharge. Municipalities levy and collect this tax.<br><br>**Value Added Tax (VAT):** Property ownership is usually subject to VAT. Residential rentals incur a 10% VAT, while other rentals generally face a 20% VAT. Landlords can reclaim or offset VAT charged on rental income.<br><br>**Real Estate Sales Income Tax:** Since April 1, 2012, profits from private property sales are taxed at a 30% rate on the difference between the purchase and sale prices.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_227" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_227" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_227" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_228" style="display:none;">Real estate investments are booming, attracting both institutional and private investors, driven by low interest rates and Germany's strong economy. Office buildings and residential properties in major cities are particularly popular. While German investors dominate the residential market, foreign investors account for roughly half of buyers in the commercial and non-residential sectors. However, investing in German real estate requires careful tax planning to avoid unnecessary burdens during purchase, ownership, and sale.<br><br>Income from German real estate, such as rent, is generally subject to German income tax. For individuals, taxable income is calculated by deducting expenses from rental income, taxed at progressive rates. For corporate investments, rental income is taxed at a flat 15% corporate income tax, plus a municipal trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) ranging from 7% to 17% for corporations and partnerships. International investors renting German properties are typically subject to limited tax liability in Germany. Double taxation treaties usually stipulate that rental income is taxed where the property is located, i.e., in Germany. A foreign company owning property directly doesn't automatically create a permanent establishment in Germany, provided it lacks domestic management. This exemption from trade tax hinges on the absence of a permanent establishment. However, engaging a German service provider for property management, especially with significant decision-making power, can create a permanent establishment. A specific rule allows for an expanded trade tax reduction for companies solely managing and using their own land, aligning them with partnerships. However, any ancillary activities, like the subletting of movable assets, can forfeit this reduction. Land transfers are subject to property acquisition tax (Grunderwerbsteuer), ranging from 3.5% to 6.5% depending on the state. Crucially, direct or indirect share transfers in property-owning companies or changes in partners of property-owning partnerships can trigger trade tax. Restructuring property-owning companies necessitates careful attention to these tax implications. Ultimately, real estate investments offer tax optimization potential through adherence to legal frameworks. Consulting a tax advisor for real estate transactions or corporate restructurings involving German properties is essential for identifying the most tax-efficient solutions.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_228" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_228" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_228" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_229" style="display:none;">The National Council of the Slovak Republic approved amendments to the Labour Code, effective May 1, 2018, introducing several changes in employment. The most significant is the phased increase in supplementary pay for night, holiday, and weekend work, starting May 1, 2018, and continuing on May 1, 2019. These increases, calculated as percentages of the minimum wage, will boost hourly earnings for many employees. For instance, night work surcharges will rise from 20% to 30% (non-hazardous) or 35% (hazardous) from May 1, 2018, and further to 40% or 50% by May 1, 2019. Holiday pay will double to 100% from May 1, 2018, and weekend pay will increase to 25% (Saturday) and 50% (Sunday) from the same date, with Sunday rates doubling again to 100% by May 1, 2019.<br><br>Additionally, the amendment exempts 13th and 14th salaries from social security contributions and taxes, up to €500 per payment, provided certain conditions are met, such as the salary being at least the average monthly wage and the employee having a minimum period of employment. Employers can pay the 13th salary in May and the 14th in November, with specific conditions regarding length of employment and prior payment of the 13th salary.<br><br>From May 1, 2018, employers must also disclose proposed salaries in job advertisements, with a commitment to pay at least the advertised amount upon hiring. Furthermore, working pensioners will be exempt from social security contributions on income up to €200 per month from July 1, 2018, applicable to one employment agreement. Changes to the Employment Services Act, also effective May 1, 2018, aim to simplify employment for third-country nationals in certain professions and areas with low unemployment, while also enhancing support for job seekers through increased mobility allowances and a new relocation grant.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_229" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_229" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_229" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_232" style="display:none;">Based on the Government of the Slovak Republic's Legislative Tasks Plan for 2018, the Ministry of Finance has submitted a draft law on insurance tax for public consultation. This proposal aims to introduce an insurance tax applicable to both non-life and life insurance sectors. The new tax will replace the current 8% levy on premiums from non-life insurance, as stipulated by the Insurance Act.<br><br>The insurance tax is a common practice in most EU member states, largely because insurance services are exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) under Council Directive 2006/112/EC. Insurance companies are responsible for collecting and remitting this tax to the state budget. The tax will apply to insurance where the risk is located domestically, primarily on premium payments. In specific instances, it will also cover insurance costs paid by a legal entity to a policyholder who contracted with an insurer from a third country.<br><br>Primarily, legal entities operating in the insurance sector, including domestic insurers, EU/EEA insurers, and branches of foreign insurers from third countries, will pay this insurance tax. The proposed 8% rate will cover most non-life insurance sectors, replacing the existing 8% contribution from premiums. Reduced rates of 4% are proposed for accident and sickness insurance. Life insurance will see rates of 2% and 3%, with an exemption for pension insurance products under the 2nd and 3rd pillars to avoid taxing pension savings. The law is intended to take effect from October 1, 2018, meaning the tax will apply to premium payments received or paid after September 30, 2018, for policies where the insurance period begins after that date.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_232" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_232" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_232" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_233" style="display:none;">On November 22, 2018, Measure of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic No. MF/16021/2017-721 was approved, establishing the templates for income tax returns as amended. This new measure changes the tax return templates for individuals (Type B) and legal entities for the year 2017. The new templates will be used for tax returns filed when the deadline falls within 2018. Consequently, all individuals filing Type B returns and all legal entities with a calendar fiscal year will use the new templates for their 2017 returns. Some legal entities with a fiscal year other than the calendar year will also adopt the new format in certain cases.<br><br>Furthermore, Measure of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic of December 8, 2017, No. MF/016923/2017-731, which establishes the template for value-added tax (VAT) returns, mandates changes to the VAT return form effective January 1, 2018. The new template will first be used in February 2018 for the January 2018 tax period.<br><br>A notable innovation also includes pre-filled tax returns for motor vehicle tax. The Financial Administration provides this form to taxpayers who electronically filed their motor vehicle tax returns for the 2016 tax period.<br><br>In summary, this text details significant updates to Slovak tax return forms. For income tax, new templates for individual (Type B) and legal entity returns for the 2017 tax year are introduced, effective for deadlines falling in 2018. The VAT return form also sees changes from January 1, 2018, with the new template first applied for the January 2018 period. Additionally, pre-filled motor vehicle tax returns are now available for eligible electronic filers from the 2016 tax year. These changes aim to standardize and potentially simplify the tax filing process for various taxpayer categories.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_233" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_233" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_233" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_234" style="display:none;">As of January 1, 2018, amendments to the Tax Administration Act (Tax Code) came into effect, introducing several legislative changes. These include modifications to the definition of tax secrecy, requiring entities to prove their entitlement to access such information. A new provision, § 19a, allows the Financial Directorate to create summary protocols for interconnected transactions of taxpayers who have violated or circumvented tax regulations.<br><br>Electronic communication with the financial administration is now mandatory for all legal entities registered in the commercial register and for all self-employed individuals registered for income tax, effective from January 1, 2018, and July 1, 2018, respectively. The concept of a "tax reliability index" has been introduced to evaluate taxpayers and offer them special tax regimes. The Financial Directorate will also publish lists of taxpayers based on income tax returns, VAT and excise tax registrations, and selected financial institutions and regulated entities.<br><br>Furthermore, the fees for binding opinions have been adjusted, and the deadline for filing appeals has been extended from 15 to 30 days. Changes in assessment proceedings ensure that the tax administrator who initiated the tax control will also issue the decision, even if a different administrator is assigned. The right to inspect files has been clarified, with exceptions for information shared with other EU member states or when disclosure could hinder tax administration or investigations. Finally, the tax code now disregards legal acts or transactions made without a proper business or economic reason, if their primary purpose is tax avoidance or unwarranted tax benefits.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_234" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_234" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_234" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_235" style="display:none;">Several amendments to the VAT Act became effective on January 1, 2018. Key changes include:<br><br>**Tax Representative for Foreign Persons:** Foreign entities not registered for VAT in Slovakia, and not otherwise liable for VAT there, can appoint a tax representative. This is applicable when they acquire goods in Slovakia from another member state for subsequent intra-community supply, export, or distance sales where the place of supply is another member state. One representative can act for multiple foreign persons, filing a single VAT return, control statement, and recapitulative statement for them. Invoices for goods supplied by a foreign person with the place of supply in Slovakia must include the tax representative's details.<br><br>**Transfer of Tax Liability (Agricultural Crops & Metals):** The domestic reverse charge mechanism now applies to all supplies of agricultural crops and metals, regardless of the invoiced price. The previous €5,000 threshold has been abolished.<br><br>**Tripartite Transactions:** Conditions for tripartite transactions have been adjusted. The first customer must not be established in the member state of the second customer. Previously, the first customer could not be VAT registered in the second customer's state. This aligns Slovak legislation with EU VAT directives.<br><br>**Recapitulative Statement:** VAT payers registered under §§ 7 and 7a of the VAT Act must submit a recapitulative statement if they are the first customer in a tripartite transaction.<br><br>**Security Deposit and Tax Administrator Obligation:** If a VAT registration is cancelled within 12 months of a security deposit being made, the tax office must promptly return the deposit. This does not apply if the cancellation is due to the dissolution of a legal entity without liquidation and a legal successor becomes a taxpayer.<br><br>**Consolidated Invoice for Foreign Persons:** From January 1, 2018, consolidated invoices for rent and supplies of utilities (electricity, gas, water, heat) over a 12-month period can be issued to foreign taxable persons, not just domestic ones as previously.<br><br>**Assignment of Receivables:** For taxpayers applying special schemes, if a customer pays for goods or services to a third party via an assigned receivable, the right to deduct VAT arises on the day of payment to that third party, up to the amount paid.<br><br>**Real Estate Supply:** When a property supply, otherwise exempt from VAT, is opted to be taxed by the supplier, the buyer becomes liable for the tax. The supplier must now inform the buyer in writing about this decision within the invoice issuance period.<br><br>**Investment Property and VAT Adjustment:** The definition of investment property now includes all constructions. The 20-year period for adjusting deducted VAT remains unchanged. This amendment applies to constructions where VAT was deducted after December 31, 2017.<br><br>---<br><br>Effective January 1, 2018, several significant amendments were made to the VAT Act. A key change is the introduction of a tax representative for foreign persons not registered for VAT in Slovakia, facilitating their participation in intra-community supplies, exports, or distance sales under specific conditions. This representative will handle VAT returns and reports for multiple foreign entities. The reverse charge mechanism was expanded to include all agricultural crops and metals, removing the previous €5,000 threshold. Tripartite transaction rules were clarified, aligning with EU directives. Obligations regarding recapitulative statements and the return of security deposits were also updated. Consolidated invoices can now be issued to foreign entities for certain recurring supplies. Changes were also introduced for VAT liability in property transactions where the supplier opts to tax, and the scope of investment property for VAT adjustment purposes was broadened to include all constructions. These updates aim to streamline VAT compliance and align with broader EU tax regulations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_235" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_235" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_235" style="display:none;"></p>

While the Czech Republic doesn't require pre-assignment registration with customs or other authorities, compliance with various rules and legal restrictions is essential to avoid penalties and ensure a smooth assignment.<br><br>EU Directive 96/71/ES mandates adherence to Czech labor laws regarding work hours, rest periods, vacation time, minimum wage, overtime pay, workplace safety, and equal treatment, even when a local contract is in place. However, if the employee's home country offers more favorable terms in any of these areas, those terms apply instead.

Form A1 is required to confirm social security affiliation.<br><br>Taxation is determined by double taxation treaties, defining tax residency and potential permanent establishments. Non-residents are taxed only on Czech-sourced income, while residents are taxed on global income.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_240" style="display:none;">The issue of cross-border employee posting is currently relevant due to the complexities of the host country's legal system, which impose numerous obligations in labor law, social security law, tax law, and other regulations. Significant changes to the regulation of employee posting were made in the Slovak Labor Code in June 2016. The Labor Code regulates three types of cross-border posting: posting under the direction and responsibility of the sending employer who provides services abroad to their customer; intra-group posting between a parent and subsidiary company or between sister companies; and temporary assignment (leasing) of an employee to a user employer, where the employee works under their direction.<br><br>This newsletter outlines simplified tax schemes related to these cross-border posting options for foreign employees working in Slovakia. If the activity is performed in Slovakia for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, Slovakia has the right to taxation. If less than 183 days, income from dependent activity is taxed abroad. However, providing services can create a permanent establishment risk. Exceeding 183 days requires the foreign employer/employee to register for income tax and pay advances in Slovakia. Employers often confuse posting with business trips, but business trips involve temporary tasks outside the scope of the employer's services.<br><br>For intra-group postings or temporary assignments, determining the employer's status is crucial. Tax advances are deducted in Slovakia from the first day by the "economic employer". The foreign employee's tax in Slovakia is settled through a tax return or annual reconciliation done by the economic employer. Due to the specifics of each employee posting, detailed information is available at martin.kino@bdrbb.sk.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_240" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_240" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_240" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_241" style="display:none;">The employment of foreign workers in Germany is steadily increasing, presenting German and international companies with various challenges. Whether through employee secondments, direct hiring of foreign nationals, or business trips to Germany, each scenario carries tax implications. Comprehensive advice is crucial, especially given rising documentation requirements and liability issues.<br><br>Initially, one must determine tax liability under German tax law. Establishing residency or usual abode in Germany subjects a worker to unlimited tax liability, meaning their worldwide income is taxable in Germany. Residency isn't limited to a personal apartment; even a furnished room can qualify. A usual abode is generally considered a continuous stay exceeding six months. Brief departures and returns typically don't interrupt this period. Numerous details require careful attention, making early, in-depth consultation essential.<br><br>If no residency or usual abode is established during activities in Germany, a limited tax liability applies. In this case, income sourced within Germany, such as wages for days worked in Germany, is subject to German income tax.<br><br>To prevent potential double taxation, the applicability of double taxation treaties (DTTs) must be checked. For dependent employment income, the principle of place of work generally dictates that Germany has the right to tax if work was performed domestically. Exceptions exist, notably the 183-day rule. If a worker residing abroad spends less than 183 days in Germany in a calendar year, and their salary is not paid by a German economic employer or permanent establishment, Germany usually lacks taxing rights. However, other conditions might trigger German taxing rights, requiring careful review of the relevant DTT and national regulations.<br><br>If a worker incurs German tax liability, the employer must act promptly. They need to process payroll for the employee in Germany, report, withhold, and remit the wage tax to the German tax authorities. Wage tax withholding is generally applied in full to income earned for work performed in Germany by individuals with unlimited tax liability. For those with limited liability or where Germany has taxing rights, withholding applies only to income earned during workdays spent in Germany.<br><br>Proactive planning is recommended to assess and optimize the tax implications of deploying workers. This includes clarifying tax liability, setting up payroll, and submitting necessary applications. Issues related to residence and social security regulations also require attention.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_241" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_241" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_241" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_242" style="display:none;">Recent French laws, such as the Loi Macron (2015) and Loi Travail (2016), have significantly tightened regulations for posted workers. The definition of "posting" is broad, covering nearly all work-related travel to France by an employee of a foreign company, regardless of duration or the employee's role. A prior notification obligation applies to all such postings, with an exception for workers permanently employed in France by foreign companies registered there and paying social contributions.<br><br>Foreign companies must appoint a French representative who speaks French, has a French postal and email address, and keeps all required documentation readily available for inspections. All postings must be reported electronically via the SIPSI portal before commencement, with a €40 fee per posted worker implemented from January 1, 2018. Posted employees are subject to French labor laws, including minimum wage, working hours, and health and safety regulations. Companies must retain extensive documentation, such as payslips, work contracts, and A1 certificates, all in French.<br><br>Non-compliance with these regulations can result in substantial fines, starting at €2,000 per violation, doubling for repeat offenses, with a maximum of €500,000. These fines apply to violations like failing to appoint a representative or submit timely declarations. Additionally, clients in France are co-responsible, obligated to verify compliance by their service providers. Failure to do so can lead to penalties mirroring those for the foreign company, including interruption of work and fines for missing A1 certificates. The French client also guarantees the €40 fee payment if the posting company fails to declare and pay.<br><br>The intensified enforcement, facilitated by online reporting, means increased inspections and a higher likelihood of significant financial and reputational consequences for non-compliant businesses. Engaging local expert advisors is recommended to navigate these complex rules and ensure smooth operations for posted workers in France.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_242" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_242" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_242" style="display:none;"></p>

This differs from cross-border temporary assignment, where an employer makes employees available to a third party (user employer). Regulations regarding labor law, minimum wage, reporting, residence permits, and social security must be adhered to.<br><br>Austrian labor law, including employee protection and regulations on working hours and rest periods (AZG, ARG, and collective agreements), must be observed if they are more beneficial to the posted or temporarily assigned employees than the regulations in their home country. A standard work week is 40 hours, and records of actual working hours must be maintained and readily available. Employees are entitled to at least the minimum wage stipulated by Austrian law or collective agreements.<br><br>EU/EEA/Swiss companies must report postings or temporary assignments using forms ZKO 3/4 to the Central Coordination Office for Illegal Employment Control before work begins. Companies posting third-country nationals require an EU posting certificate from the AMS, which verifies proper employment and adherence to Austrian wage and working conditions.<br><br>Third-country companies posting workers do not report to the Central Coordination Office; instead, the Austrian employer must apply for posting or employment permits. For temporary assignments from third countries, the Austrian company needs a special temporary assignment permit and subsequent employment permit from the AMS.<br><br>Third-country nationals require a visa and residence permit (if staying over six months); EU citizens need a residence certificate if staying longer than three months. Employees typically remain insured under their home country's social security system for postings/assignments up to 24 months, provided they don't replace previous workers. A1 certificates confirm existing insurance coverage.<br><br>Required documents (A1 certificate, posting report copy, wage records, and work permit, if applicable) must be available in German at the work location.

A limited-risk manufacturer is responsible for all production phases but doesn't own intangible assets, instead licensing them.<br><br>A contract manufacturer focuses solely on production and quality control according to the principal's specifications.

A full-fledged manufacturer handles everything from design to sales, owning intangibles and bearing full risk. Limited-risk manufacturers handle all production phase but license intangible assets. Contract manufacturers produce goods to specifications, owning them until sale but not involved in design or distribution. Toll manufacturers are similar to contract manufacturers but never own the inventory. Generally, the more risk and functions a manufacturer undertakes, the greater their expected compensation under transfer pricing principles. These different models are employed to best achieve business objectives, with the riskier models potentially offering more profit but with greater responsibility and resources required.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_244" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_244" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_244" style="display:none;"></p>

The proposed amendment, effective January 1, 2018, introduces a tax reliability index to objectively assess tax subjects based on their compliance, incentivizing higher reliability with benefits and potentially special tax regimes. It also mandates electronic filing for all legal entities and income tax-registered entrepreneurs, with limited exceptions, extending this requirement to their representatives (excluding lawyers and tax advisors).<br><br>Furthermore, the amendment empowers the Financial Directorate to create comprehensive protocols on interconnected transactions of tax subjects found violating tax regulations, particularly within fraudulent chains. These protocols, derived from tax audits and on-site investigations, will provide a holistic view of participant behavior without replacing individual audit reports. Finally, the Financial Directorate will publish quarterly lists of corporate income taxpayers, including non-profit entities, detailing assessed tax, additional tax assessments, or tax losses. Lists of VAT payers with claimed or additionally claimed VAT refunds will also be published quarterly, with a minimum threshold set by the Ministry of Finance.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_246" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_246" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_246" style="display:none;"></p>

Key changes include adjustments to the tax security deposit, extending the deposit requirement to entities with tax arrears exceeding €1,000 or those deregistered for repeated non-compliance. The definition of a participant in a triangular transaction is refined to focus on the absence of a registered office or fixed establishment in the second customer's member state. A specific VAT liability is introduced for assignees using special arrangements, triggering tax liability upon assignment with a corresponding deduction right for the customer.<br><br>The proposed changes also abolish the €5,000 threshold for reverse charge on grains and metals, extending it to all supplies of these commodities. A summary invoice for electricity, gas, water, and heat can now be issued to foreign taxable persons for periods up to 12 months. Faster refunds of excess deductions are proposed based on control statement data, even before a tax audit. Those registered for tax under specific sections will be required to submit a summary statement if they participate in a triangular transaction as the first customer. Finally, VAT deducted from payments must be returned in the last tax period if the goods or services were not delivered by the date of deregistration.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_247" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_247" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_247" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_248" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic is proposing an amendment to the Income Tax Act to combat tax fraud, aggressive tax planning, and base erosion and profit shifting. The changes align with the Slovak government's program statement, legislative plan for 2017, and the EU's Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), which Slovakia must implement by December 31, 2018, with certain exceptions effective from January 1, 2019, and a one-year extension for transfer pricing rules.<br><br>The amendment affects laws on banks, housing loans, and tax administration. Key changes include a new debt relief mechanism via bankruptcy or payment schedule, providing tax-free income for discharged debts and deductible allowances for claims against debtors with court-ordered payment schedules. A tax bonus on mortgage interest payments is proposed, capped at €50,000 per property. Support for domestic spa care and tourism is included, introducing a non-taxable portion of income for spa-related expenses (food, accommodation, procedures) up to €50 per taxpayer, spouse, and dependent child, claimable by only one of them.<br><br>A special tax regime for commercial use of intangible assets, such as patents and software developed in Slovakia, offers a 50% tax exemption on royalties. Additionally, a 50% exemption is proposed for embedded royalties from the sale of products using registered intellectual property, after deducting direct and indirect costs and a market-based markup. The amendment also clarifies the taxation of profit shares for partners in public trading and limited partnerships with stakes in limited liability companies or cooperatives. Non-cash contributions will be valued at fair market value. An "exit tax" ensures taxation of unrealized capital gains when assets or tax residency move abroad, with a 21% rate and possible installment payments. A new non-deductible expense rule targets double deduction situations between related parties, and the deadline for remitting withholding tax for apartment owners is extended. Most provisions take effect on January 1, 2018, with some on January 1, 2019.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_248" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_248" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_248" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_250" style="display:none;">From July 2017, the Slovak Financial Administration began monitoring illegal online gambling, targeting websites that do not comply with Slovak legislation regarding gambling. Specifically, it focuses on entities operating online gambling games without a valid license issued by the Slovak Ministry of Finance, offering prohibited services. These entities will be published on a list of banned websites maintained by the Financial Administration, updated weekly from July 17, 2017. The Financial Administration will request court orders to block these websites and incoming payments to the accounts of illegal gambling providers.<br><br>Operating prohibited services can result in fines of up to €500,000. The main reasons for combating illegal online gambling are tax evasion and protecting minors from gambling. However, experts predict a difficult and potentially impossible battle for the Financial Administration against illegal online gambling. A list of banned websites is available.<br><br>The Financial Administration is taking action against illegal online gambling to tackle tax evasion, protect minors, and enforce gambling laws. Websites operating without a valid Slovak license will be blacklisted, and legal action will be pursued to block access and payments. This initiative aims to curb prohibited online gambling services, which are subject to substantial fines. Despite these efforts, experts anticipate significant challenges in effectively combating illegal online gambling activities.

Key measures include preventing dishonest company mergers by requiring an auditor's attestation for financially troubled companies seeking to merge, holding the auditor responsible for the merger's risk. The amendment also criminalizes the use of "straw men" (front individuals for fraudulent activities), imposing up to a 15-year prison sentence for involvement in such schemes, including those who facilitate these transfers or transfer their company shares to straw men. Furthermore, it tightens penalties for irresponsible statutory representatives who fail to file for bankruptcy on time, making them liable for damages to creditors and potentially disqualifying them from holding directorial positions for three years. Board members will now need to be physically capable, legally competent, and have a clean criminal record. Public sector partners will face a stricter 30-day payment deadline for subcontractor invoices on public contracts. Company deregistration will require consent from both tax and social security authorities. Individuals with tax or social security debt will be barred from establishing limited liability companies. The amendment also clarifies rules for other capital funds, introducing notification duties for distributions to shareholders, including a crisis test and public announcement of distribution amounts.<br><br>The proposed amendment to Slovakia's Commercial Code, effective January 1, 2018, aims to combat tax fraud and enhance the business climate.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_257" style="display:none;">Selling goods through an e-shop is a popular form of commerce with no special VAT adjustments. However, certain specifics must be considered. Here’s an overview of three key VAT-related areas for operating an e-shop in the Czech Republic.<br><br>First, VAT registration and regime. Czech-based e-shops selling to non-businesses in the Czech Republic and EU must consider VAT registration based on their turnover. Registration is mandatory when exceeding CZK 1 million in domestic supplies within 12 months, or voluntary. After registering, the e-shop is obligated to pay VAT on domestic sales and can deduct VAT on purchases. "Identification for VAT" is mandatory if purchases from EU exceed CZK 326,000 or if service received from EU suppliers. Identified persons must pay VAT on EU purchases and received services, but they cannot deduct VAT.<br><br>Second, the place of taxable supply determines where VAT is applied. Sales within the Czech Republic are subject to Czech VAT rules. For goods sent to non-business EU customers, the "dispatch of goods to the EU" regime applies. If goods are sent to EU countries, the limit of sales is tracked for each country of delivery and if such a limit is exceeded registration for VAT is required in such country.<br><br>Third, electronic sales records (EET) are mandatory in the Czech Republic since March 1, 2017, for all cash and card payments, or other cashless transfers. Czech e-shops must record all sales, including international transactions. Sales should be registered no later than when the transaction is completed, but earlier registration is allowed. Even sales returns must be reported according to EET. Due to cross-border e-commerce, it is recommended to follow the legal regulations in countries which the e-shop usually conducts trade with.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_257" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_257" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_257" style="display:none;"></p>

This legislative change aimed for fairer tax distribution by taxing at the point of consumption and removing competitive advantages previously held by providers in EU member states with lower VAT rates.<br><br>MOSS allows service providers to register for VAT in only one member state, declaring and paying VAT for all services within this special scheme through that state's tax portal, instead of registering in every member state where services are provided. However, if a provider offers other services besides those covered by MOSS, they must register for VAT in the respective member state.<br><br>In Austria, registration via FinanzOnline requires a valid VAT ID, timely application, and no existing registration block. Austrian-based providers, or those from third countries with a permanent establishment in Austria, can register. Providers without a presence in the EU can also choose Austria as their member state of identification. The tax period is a calendar quarter, and returns must be filed by the 20th of the following month.<br><br>MOSS facilitates the declaration and payment of VAT for services provided to non-business customers in member states where the provider lacks a business or establishment. The VAT return includes the VAT ID, total value of services provided under MOSS, VAT rate, and the tax due, broken down by member state, all in Euros. A nil return is required even if no services were provided during the tax period. Note that if services are sold through a platform (e.g., Appstore) where the platform operator is considered the service provider to the end customer, the operator is liable for VAT.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_258" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_258" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_258" style="display:none;"></p>

If this leads to sales and goods are shipped to other EU member states, certain peculiarities must be observed. The risk of filing incorrect VAT returns and reports, both domestically and abroad, can ultimately lead to significant negative criminal and tax consequences.<br><br>In principle, the taxation principle based on the country of origin applies (VAT is declared where the shipment begins), so a German distributor declares their deliveries with German VAT. However, if goods are supplied to a specific group of customers in other EU member states, the basic rule of taxation according to the country of origin does not apply. In that case, the taxation principle based on the country of destination applies, and the German distributor declares the goods with the VAT of the respective EU country and remits the tax in that member state.<br><br>The regulation for mail-order sales is intended to prevent unequal competitive conditions within the European Union. If the country-of-origin principle applied without limitation, consumers would be incentivized to order goods in EU countries with the lowest VAT rates. Equal competitive conditions and VAT revenues within the European Union would be at risk.<br><br>To determine whether the basic rule for mail-order sales applies, domestic distributors must know the customer type and destination country for each transaction made through their sales platform. Their merchandise management systems and/or sales platforms should allow for the input of this information.<br><br>If the customer is a business located in another member state receiving the delivery for their business, it is generally an intra-community tax-exempt supply. The necessary documentation can be fulfilled by providing the customer's VAT registration number in the online order. The German distributor then issues a tax invoice without VAT and includes the taxable supply in its summary report.<br><br>The basic rule for mail-order sales can only be applied to a specific group of businesses in the EU if their received deliveries for one year do not exceed a certain turnover threshold, the application of the turnover threshold has not been waived, and the German distributor's deliveries to that EU state for one year have not exceeded the mail-order sales threshold.<br><br>For deliveries to private individuals in another EU member state, the VAT that the German mail-order company must declare and remit depends on the extent of deliveries to that country of destination within one year. If the goods are initially declared with German VAT, the first delivery exceeding the mail-order sales threshold in the respective EU state leads to declaration with the VAT applicable in that EU state. All subsequent supplies are then taxed at the VAT rate applicable in the country of destination. If the distributor fails to do so, there is a risk of having to pay VAT multiple times.<br><br>The VAT threshold and the mail-order sales threshold values are not uniform across Europe and vary considerably in some cases.<br><br>Businesses can voluntarily opt to tax sales based on the destination of the goods, even if the sales threshold hasn't been met, but must continue this practice until the end of the calendar year following the one in which they made the decision.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>The increasing use of e-shops by entrepreneurs necessitates careful attention to VAT regulations when shipping goods to other EU member states. The principle of taxation shifts from the country of origin to the country of destination once specific sales thresholds are met for particular customer groups or countries. Understanding customer types and destination countries is critical for determining VAT obligations. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties and tax liabilities. Special rules apply to businesses with sales below certain turnover limits and to private individuals. The VAT and mail-order thresholds vary across EU member states, requiring careful monitoring and currency exchange rate tracking. Businesses can also choose to apply destination-based taxation voluntarily, even if thresholds aren't met, but must continue doing so for a minimum duration.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_259" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_259" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_259" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_260" style="display:none;">On January 28, 2016, Slovakia joined thirty other countries in signing the Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting agreement, a key element of the OECD's action plan on transfer pricing. CbC reporting applies to large multinational groups with consolidated annual revenue exceeding €750 million. These groups are required to annually report information to the relevant financial authorities in each member state. These authorities will then automatically exchange data on the global allocation of income, profits, capital, employees, assets, and taxes paid. The aim of CbC reporting is to help tax authorities detect inaccuracies in multinational companies' pricing and associated tax evasion.<br><br>The Slovakian Parliament approved the law on international assistance and cooperation in tax administration on February 1, 2017, effective from March 1, 2017, implying the rules apply to the 2016 tax year. This regulation affects every member of a multinational group, including branches and permanent establishments, with consolidated revenues surpassing €750 million. This includes an obligation to report the identity of the reporting entity. The deadline for submitting the CbC report is 12 months from the last day of the multinational group's reporting financial year, first applicable for the financial year 2016 for parent entities. The deadline for submitting the notification is the last day for filing the income tax return for the reporting financial year. Failure to submit the CbC report can result in a fine of up to €10,000, and failure to comply with the notification obligation can incur a fine of up to €3,000.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_260" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_260" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_260" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_263" style="display:none;">Attention legal entities paying income tax advances!<br><br>Due to an amendment in the income tax law reducing the corporate income tax rate from 22% to 21%, adjustments are needed in calculating tax advances paid from January 1, 2017, until the deadline for filing the 2016 tax return (March 31, 2017, or extended deadline). The law mandates using the tax rate applicable in the tax period for which the advances are paid (21% for 2017).<br><br>The calculation of tax advances is based on the last known tax liability from the 2015 tax period. Therefore, the tax amount from line 1110 of the 2015 tax return needs to be recalculated using the current 21% tax rate for 2017. This recalculated amount should then be divided into 4 or 12 equal installments, depending on whether you are a quarterly or monthly payer, respectively. This determines the amount of tax advances you will pay at the current tax rate until filing the 2016 tax return, with payments due at the end of the corresponding month or quarter. According to the guide for filling out the corporate income tax return, the 21% tax rate should be used for calculating tax advances for the tax period starting January 1, 2017.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Legal entities paying income tax advances must adjust their calculations due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 22% to 21%. For advances paid from January 1, 2017, until the 2016 tax return deadline, the tax amount from line 1110 of the 2015 return must be recalculated using the 21% rate. The resulting amount is then divided into quarterly or monthly installments based on the payment frequency. These adjusted advance payments are due until the 2016 tax return is filed. The new tax rate should be taken into account when calculating tax advances. The calculation formula provided in the corporate income tax return guide should be followed, utilizing the new 21% tax rate.

Key changes include the introduction of a "summary assessment order" for cases where tax returns have deficiencies not yet addressed by the taxpayer, and where sufficient evidence exists. This order can be appealed within 15 days, but only the court can review it.<br><br>The act also strengthens provisional measures. Tax administrators can now require taxpayers to deposit funds or refrain from disposing of specified assets if there's a risk of non-payment or difficulty in tax recovery. Failure to comply can lead to immediate enforceability and become an enforcement title, with funds being blocked directly by banks.<br><br>Furthermore, deficiencies in tax returns are now categorized based on their impact on the tax amount. Those affecting tax liability trigger a tax audit or a summary assessment, while minor errors will be corrected by the tax office ex officio after a notification period. The requirement for collateral for tax payment deferrals or installments has been raised to EUR 3,000.<br><br>The law also streamlines the summoning process by allowing tax administrators to request police assistance for compulsory appearance if repeated summons are ignored.

This extension, enacted by the National Council, addresses the issue of low adoption of electronic ID cards with necessary security features among company representatives. The primary goal is to allow more time for companies to prepare for the transition to electronic communication with the state. Furthermore, the amendment introduces a 10-day period after mailbox activation, enabling owners to authorize designated individuals to manage their electronic mailboxes. This aims to facilitate a smoother and more manageable transition to the e-Government system for businesses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_267" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_267" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_267" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_268" style="display:none;">The Act aims to establish a financial instrument under the self-governing authority of municipalities. Each municipality can voluntarily introduce this instrument through its own generally binding regulation, serving revenue-generating, development-promoting, and anti-corruption functions. Approved by the National Council of the Slovak Republic on December 7, 2016, this Act amends Law No. 447/2015 Coll. concerning the local development fee.<br><br>A municipality can introduce the development fee within its territory via a generally binding regulation. Once approved by the municipal council, the municipality is obligated to levy the fee on individuals meeting the legal conditions. The fee applies to above-ground construction projects for which a building permit has been issued, reported to the building authority, altered before completion, or subsequently authorized.<br><br>The fee is calculated based on the new or additional floor area created above ground. Exemptions include maintenance, repairs, renovations, modernization of residential buildings that don't alter the total floor area, minor structures, additions and extensions up to 25 m2, healthcare facilities, and buildings serving kindergartens, sports, museums, libraries, or galleries.<br><br>The payer is the individual or entity with the building permit or that has reported the construction. The fee rate ranges from 3 to 35 euros per square meter of above-ground floor area. The base for the fee is the area of ​​the above-ground part of the floor area of ​​the realized building in m2. The municipality can levy the fee for the first time on a construction project for which a building permit was issued after the effective date of this Act, but no sooner than after the introduction of the development fee by a generally binding regulation of the municipality. The effective date of the law is December 31, 2016. It is advised to monitor the municipal webpages for the generally binding regulations regarding the development fee.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_268" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_268" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_268" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_270" style="display:none;">The provided text outlines changes to the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act in Slovakia, effective from 2017. Key changes include adjustments regarding VAT deductions for foreign taxable persons, prioritizing VAT refunds over deductions except in specific cases like reverse charge scenarios. There's a shortened timeframe for returning VAT refunds on vehicles with diplomatic license plates if destroyed or sold within six months. A legal "fiction" is introduced for construction work VAT liability, shifting responsibility to the recipient if the invoice indicates "reverse charge." Suppliers using reverse charge in the construction sector must report these invoices in a control statement, even if not reported on the tax return. The act introduces compensation (interest) for excessive VAT refund delays exceeding six months due to tax audits, initiated ex officio by the tax office, unless the delay is due to the taxpayer. Finally, the effective date of self-assessment for imports from third countries has been postponed, dependent on Slovakia's public debt levels relative to EU limits, applying from January of the second calendar year following the Eurostat's publication.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_270" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_270" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_270" style="display:none;"></p>

It applies to large multinational groups with consolidated annual revenue exceeding 750 million euros, requiring them to report information to relevant financial authorities annually. These authorities then automatically exchange information on global allocation of income, profits, capital, employees, assets, and taxes paid, facilitating the detection of pricing inaccuracies and tax avoidance.<br><br>Action 14 aims to improve dispute resolution mechanisms related to double taxation treaties, including arbitration provisions. Slovakia aims to renegotiate its treaties to meet current requirements.<br><br>Action 15 involves a Multilateral Instrument (MLI), joined by 94 countries, which efficiently renegotiates existing bilateral tax treaties. The MLI can modify treaty articles related to hybrid instruments, treaty abuse, artificial avoidance of permanent establishments, and effective dispute resolution.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_274" style="display:none;">The Czech Ministry of Finance issued a document on April 22, 2016, in response to the European ATAD directive, aiming to discuss the implementation of BEPS action plans into Czech legislation. Several action plans are being or will be implemented.<br><br>Action Plan 2 addresses hybrid mismatches. Since May 1, 2016, dividends received by a parent company are not exempt if the subsidiary can deduct these payments from its tax base. This restriction will extend to sales of shares in subsidiaries.<br><br>Action Plan 3 introduces Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules, allowing parent companies to be taxed on profits of their low-taxed subsidiaries, provided the parent holds at least a 50% stake. In the Czech Republic, dividend income and capital gains from subsidiaries are not exempt if the subsidiary is located outside the EU without a double tax treaty or is subject to a tax rate below 12%. This restriction applies even with a 10% parent ownership.<br><br>Action Plan 4 proposes limiting interest deductibility, extending beyond related parties to also include interest paid to unrelated parties. The OECD proposal suggests a debt-to-EBITDA ratio limit (10-30%). This would impact more companies and be influenced by debt levels and interest rate changes, potentially affecting business investment.<br><br>Action Plan 5 enhances tackling harmful tax practices through the automatic exchange of advance pricing agreements and tax rulings.<br><br>Action Plans 8-10 focus on aligning transfer pricing with economic activity. The Czech Republic adheres to the arm's length principle, interpreted through guidelines. Since 2015, companies must submit an appendix detailing related-party transactions with their tax returns, with data used for risk selection. Payments to entities outside the EU for royalties are a risk criterion. The Czech Republic currently lacks provisions against the transfer of intangibles like IP or patents to preferential tax jurisdictions. As Czech companies invest more in R&D, the question arises whether exit taxation should apply to functional profile changes and the relocation of routine production to lower-tax countries, driven by cost savings or tax advantages. The principle of substance over form is increasingly applied in tax audits, scrutinizing economic activities over contractual arrangements.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_274" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_274" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_274" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_275" style="display:none;">We would like to inform you about the Austrian Transfer Pricing Documentation Act (TPDA), which came into effect in October 2016. This law expands the regulations for multinational corporations for tax periods beginning after January 1, 2016. If certain conditions are met, particularly turnover thresholds, these new obligations apply.<br><br>The TPDA, in line with OECD requirements, establishes a three-part documentation structure: a Master File, a Local File, and a Country-by-Country Report (CbCR). The Master File describes the entire group of companies and its global economic activities and transfer pricing policies. The Local File contains information about specific economic transactions of the domestic entity. The CbCR provides information on the global distribution of income, tax obligations, and economic activities within a specific multinational group, including a list of the multinational group's companies.<br><br>The extent of required documentation depends on turnover. Master and Local Files are mandatory if revenues in the last two preceding periods exceeded EUR 50 million according to Austrian accounting standards. A CbCR is required if the group's turnover reached at least EUR 750 million in the previous year according to the consolidated profit and loss statement. The ultimate parent company prepares the report, though this responsibility can be transferred to another Austrian subsidiary under certain conditions.<br><br>Master and Local Files must be submitted to the tax authority within 30 days upon request.

However, in connection with the mandatory activation of mailboxes for legal entities, the date of mandatory activation for legal entities based in the Slovak Republic not registered in the commercial register has changed. Their electronic mailboxes will be automatically activated for delivery only on May 1, 2018. This applies, for example, to civic associations, foundations, non-profit organizations, and similar legal entities.<br><br>These entities can voluntarily activate their electronic mailboxes for the delivery of official decisions by the specified date, using a dedicated function. The delay in the mandatory activation date for legal entities not registered in the commercial register stems from the Act on trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The state establishes electronic mailboxes free of charge on the portal slovensko.sk. Authorities will send various notifications, calls, alerts, decisions, and other documents to these mailboxes from institutions like the Social Insurance Agency and courts. More detailed information can be found on the slovensko.sk website.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_276" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_276" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_276" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_277" style="display:none;">A new law, the Act on the Register of Public Sector Partners, takes effect in February to increase transparency in state-private sector dealings. The law mandates the creation of a public register of entities contracting with the state and public law bodies, including those supplying goods or services to identified "public sector partners." This aims to ensure ultimate beneficial ownership is disclosed, moving away from a reliance on self-declarations.<br><br>The legislation introduces a stricter verification process for ultimate beneficial owners, who are defined as individuals with actual control or in whose favor transactions are conducted. Lawyers, notaries, banks, auditors, and tax advisors will be responsible alongside the public sector partner for identifying and verifying these individuals. Exceptions to registration exist for single payments under €100,000 or cumulative annual payments not exceeding €250,000. For asset acquisition, the limit is €100,000 in aggregate value.<br><br>Penalties for non-compliance, such as providing false information or failing to report changes within 60 days, range from fines equivalent to the economic benefit gained to a maximum of €1,000,000. Fines can also be levied on statutory bodies. The Slovak anti-shell law is presented as a unique global initiative demanding ownership disclosure from companies doing business with the state and potentially serving as a model for anti-corruption efforts across Europe. The Ministry of Justice administers the register, which is publicly accessible.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_277" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_277" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_277" style="display:none;"></p>

The primary change, effective January 1, 2017, involves increasing the contribution base ceiling from five to seven times the average monthly wage, raising it from EUR 4,290 to EUR 6,181. This applies to the maximum contribution base for self-employed individuals and freelancers, as well as for employees and employers. Consequently, the law indirectly sets the highest amount of contributions payable to the Social Insurance Agency.<br><br>The amendment also revises the maximum daily contribution base for calculating income replacement during temporary incapacity for work and sickness benefits. Effective January 1, 2017, this maximum limit is raised from 1.5 times to 2 times the general contribution base for the year 2015 (EUR 10,596). This adjustment impacts calculations for sickness benefits, care allowance, equalization benefits, and maternity benefits.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_278" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_278" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_278" style="display:none;"></p>

This harmonization is intended to boost legal certainty and reduce transaction risks.<br><br>The regulation clarifies what constitutes immovable property and which services are considered property-related, primarily to prevent double taxation or non-taxation. Services are deemed property-related only if they have a sufficiently direct link to the property, either by being performed on it or being aimed at its physical or legal alteration. Excluded are services like advertising (even if conducted on property), travel agency services, and providing exhibition space with ancillary services (e.g., Wi-Fi), as well as portfolio management for real estate investments and certain legal services.<br><br>Examples of property-related services include architectural projects for specific plots, expert, legal, and brokerage services for specific properties (like sales and lease mediation, notarization, contract drafting), property management (health and safety, cleaning, maintenance, rent collection, site supervision, advertising vacancies, lease negotiation), and employee provision only if the provider retains responsibility for the work performed.

This obligation applies to transactions with both legal entities and natural persons without exception. A new Guideline No. MF/014283/2016-724, which clarifies the documentation obligations of public administration accounting units, central administration, and entities with direct or indirect state, municipal, or higher territorial self-governing unit participation, came into effect in July 2016. However, the requirements for the content of the documentation have not fundamentally changed for these entities.<br><br>A comparability analysis is considered key for selecting the most suitable transfer pricing method and for setting the correct transfer price for tax purposes. The comparability analysis represents an important piece of evidence, especially during tax audits. However, in practice, entrepreneurs face significant challenges in obtaining comparable data to justify the prices used in controlled transactions, as the taxpayer bears the responsibility for comparability. Several information sources are used to obtain external comparable data. The Amadeus database is the most commonly used. The Slovak tax administration also uses this database for tax audits.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_283" style="display:none;">In October 2015, the OECD finalized proposals for its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Following negotiations, the OECD approved amendments to the Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations concerning Actions 8-10. These changes, effective immediately upon publication, focus on the application of the arm's length principle and intangible assets.<br><br>The revised guidelines redefine intangible assets, emphasizing the distinction between legal and beneficial owners. They also introduce additional factors for comparability analysis, such as exclusivity, scope and duration of legal protection, geographic area, useful life, development stage, product enhancement rights, and future benefit expectations. Thirty-three illustrative examples are provided for clarity.<br><br>A new section addresses synergies within corporate groups, clarifying that these benefits, such as economies of scale from centralized purchasing, are only recognized for transfer pricing purposes if they result from targeted group activities. If a group member, like a regional manager, negotiates bulk discounts that benefit other subsidiaries, this targeted activity generates a positive synergy that should be allocated based on purchasing volume. However, if favorable terms are offered to attract other group members without a deliberate group strategy, no synergy is recognized.<br><br>Intangible assets are defined as non-physical, non-financial assets that owners can utilize in business relationships, with their use or transfer incurring compensation between independent parties. Importantly, the transfer pricing classification of intangibles may differ from accounting classifications; assets expensed during development can still hold economic value and be treated as intangibles for transfer pricing. The guidelines stress the need to differentiate legal owners from beneficial owners, ensuring the legal owner bears associated risks and performs functions related to maintaining, improving, and protecting the intangible, although these activities can be outsourced.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_283" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_283" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_283" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_285" style="display:none;">What are the duties of a company director when the company has negative equity?<br><br>Under commercial law, the term "crisis" is a new concept introduced by an amendment to the Commercial Code effective January 1, 2016. A company is in crisis if it is bankrupt or facing bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is imminent if the ratio of its equity to liabilities is less than 4 to 100 (this ratio was set for 2016, increasing to 6 to 100 in 2017 and 8 to 100 in 2018). Companies in crisis are subject to new provisions and restrictions, particularly the prohibition of returning statutory payments.<br><br>The Commercial Code mandates that the statutory body of a company, upon realizing or being able to realize that the company is in crisis, must take all necessary actions with professional diligence to overcome the situation, as a reasonably diligent person in a similar position would.<br><br>According to the Bankruptcy and Restructuring Act, a company that is over-indebted must file for bankruptcy within 30 days of becoming aware, or being able to become aware through professional diligence, of its over-indebtedness. The statutory body of the company is responsible for filing this proposal. Failure to file on time can result in a fine of EUR 12,500, and any agreement exempting the statutory body from this fine is void. Over-indebtedness is defined as having more than one creditor, where the value of liabilities exceeds the value of assets, considering expected future asset management or business operations. Certain subordinate liabilities are not included in the calculation of liabilities.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_285" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_285" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_285" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_286" style="display:none;">The Slovak Ministry of Finance has proposed amendments to several laws, potentially effective January 1, 2017, or January 1, 2018. Key changes include a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21% for periods starting January 1, 2017. Dividends paid to individuals will be taxed at 15% starting January 1, 2018, with health contributions abolished. Corporate dividends will only be taxed if from non-contracting states, at a 35% rate, aimed at combating tax evasion.<br><br>Transfer pricing rules will see increased penalties for intentional tax base reduction. The process for self-correction of transfer prices will be streamlined. New provisions introduce shortened assessment procedures for tax deficiencies and simplify tax payment deferral conditions.<br><br>VAT law will standardize VAT refund claims for foreign entities providing construction services, prioritizing refunds over tax returns. Taxpayers will be entitled to 1.5% annual interest on overpaid VAT amounts retained during tax audits beyond six months.<br><br>Excise taxes on tobacco products will increase from 2017, with further hikes planned for 2019, primarily for public health and revenue stability. Businesses in regulated sectors like energy, postal services, insurance, and telecommunications may see their profit-based levies double from 0.363% to 0.726%, effective December 31, 2016. The Ministry will monitor these proposals through the interdepartmental review process.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_286" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_286" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_286" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_287" style="display:none;">The European Union is set to adopt a package of measures to combat tax evasion, a global issue requiring worldwide solutions. Following the BEPS project, this initiative has the approval of the Slovak Ministry of Finance. Introduced in early 2016, the "Anti-Tax Evasion Package" consists of four parts aimed at curbing cross-border tax avoidance: ATAD Directive, recommendations against tax treaty abuse, expanded administrative cooperation, and external strategy communication.<br><br>Key provisions within the ATAD Directive include an interest limitation rule, stricter than Slovakia's current thin capitalization rule, along with a general anti-abuse rule, exit taxation, and controlled foreign company rules. Recommendations to prevent tax treaty abuse are also crucial. Obligatory automatic exchange of tax information will see increased stringency.<br><br>Multinational enterprises with consolidated turnover exceeding €750 million will be required to publicly disclose information on income tax accrued and paid, employee numbers, net turnover, and profit before tax. This data will be accessible in the commercial register and on company websites for five years. The external strategy aims to enhance transparency, set standards for good tax governance, and ensure fair tax competition. Implementation of these changes is anticipated in 2017 or 2018.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_287" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_287" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_287" style="display:none;"></p>

This regulation stems from the OECD's initiative to combat global tax evasion, specifically through the framework of FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), a U.S. law. FATCA facilitates the automatic exchange of financial account information between signatory countries for tax purposes, focusing on the income of residents in these countries.<br><br>Slovak financial institutions are required to provide specific details about account holders, such as account numbers, balances, or values, and any associated gross income. For FATCA implementation, the Slovak Financial Administration was mandated to receive information from financial institutions for the years 2014 and 2015 by June 30, 2016, and subsequently provide this information to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service by September 30, 2016. Slovakia joined countries committed to this automatic exchange of information. In practice, EU financial institutions, and those in many other nations, must ascertain client tax residency according to set procedures from January 1, 2016, and report this data annually from 2017. Austria received a one-year deferral in this process.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_290" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_290" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_290" style="display:none;"></p>

Primarily, this obligation arises when the foreign entity is the recipient of construction work performed within Slovakia, or when they receive goods that include installation or assembly services, provided these are supplied by another foreign person. This rule, effective from January 1, 2016, designates the recipient of such services as the party responsible for paying the VAT.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_294" style="display:none;">On May 1, 2016, the new Union Customs Code (Regulation (EU) No 952/2013) and its implementing provisions (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447) came into effect, establishing a new foundation for customs law across the EU. The primary objectives of this update are to streamline customs regulations, enhance legal certainty, and transition customs authorities to a fully electronic environment.<br><br>A key change is the increased importance placed on the "Authorised Economic Operator" (AEO) status. AEOs are companies that, upon meeting specific criteria such as compliance with customs regulations, proper accounting, and solvency, can benefit from customs procedure simplifications. These simplifications can include centralized customs clearance in multiple member states or exemption from presenting goods during local customs procedures.<br><br>The updated code also mandates that AEO applicants must not have committed serious tax law infringements in the preceding three years. Furthermore, the new legislation addresses changes in royalty payments. Previously, royalties were often excluded from customs value and thus not subject to import duties. However, under the new rules, royalties will be added to the customs value if the goods can only be sold upon payment of royalties to the licensor, or if the seller unconditionally requires payment of royalties to a third-party provider. This is expected to lead to more detailed examination of trade agreements.<br><br>The new customs law also eliminates the practice of using the "price of first sale" as the basis for calculating import duties, instead requiring the invoiced price from the supplier. Transitional arrangements allow the previous method until December 31, 2017, if the contract was concluded by January 18, 2016. The legislation introduces new ways for customs debts to be extinguished, such as when infringements have no substantial impact on the customs procedure and are rectified, or if the goods were merely moved out of the EU without fraudulent intent. Other changes include relaxed rules for amending customs declarations, the introduction of global guarantees, modifications to binding information on goods classification and origin, supplier declaration regulations, and a future requirement for guarantees for approved placements of goods.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_294" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_294" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_294" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_295" style="display:none;">Delayed VAT Registration – The Value Added Tax Act No. 222/2004 Coll., as amended (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Act"), imposes certain obligations even on non-VAT payers. Entrepreneurs who are not VAT payers should continuously monitor their revenues to reach the turnover threshold for mandatory VAT registration. If they do not pay sufficient attention to their accounting during the year, it may happen in practice that after some time they realize they should have applied for VAT registration.<br><br>The period during which a taxable person who has not fulfilled their obligation and has not timely submitted a registration application should have been a taxpayer is understood as the period starting on the 31st day after the day when the person was obliged to submit the VAT registration application at the latest, and ending on the day preceding the day of registration as a taxpayer. The definition of this period, taking into account the 30-day delay, applies only to domestic taxable persons, i.e., persons having their registered office, branch, or residence in the Slovak Republic.<br><br>This article clarifies the obligations for non-VAT registered businesses in Slovakia regarding VAT registration. It highlights that even businesses not currently registered for VAT must continuously monitor their turnover. Failure to do so can result in a situation where they belatedly discover they have exceeded the mandatory registration threshold. The VAT Act defines a specific period for which such a business becomes liable as a taxpayer if they fail to register on time. This period begins 31 days after the missed registration deadline and ends the day before their actual registration. Importantly, this rule regarding the 30-day delay specifically applies to businesses operating within Slovakia.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_295" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_295" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_295" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_296" style="display:none;">Changes to a company's details, such as a partner's address, name, or the share capital amount, may seem like minor trivialities at first glance, but this is far from the truth. According to Slovak law (§5 par. 5 of Act No. 530/2003 Coll. on the Commercial Register), individuals registered in the commercial register, or those authorized to act on behalf of a registered legal entity, are obligated to submit a proposal for the registration of changed or deleted data within 30 days of the legal fact's effect. A member of the statutory body is responsible for informing the registry court of these changes. Failure to comply can result in a fine of up to €3,310 imposed directly on the responsible statutory body member. Neglecting to update information in the commercial register can lead to practical issues in everyday life, for example, when withdrawing money from a company's bank account if the director's ID details do not match the registered commercial register information. Similar complications can arise with postal services or during normal business transactions. Since July 1, 2016, a civil non-contentious procedure has been in effect, governing the process of aligning data in the commercial register with the actual legal status. Any party with a legitimate interest in ensuring a company has accurate registered data can initiate this procedure.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_296" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_296" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_296" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_298" style="display:none;">Electronic sales registration (EET) was adopted in the Czech Republic in April 2016. This law mandates businesses to electronically report all cash and card transactions to the tax administrator. The system requires businesses to send transaction data in XML format via the internet. Upon receipt, the tax administrator issues a fiscal identification code, which must be printed on customer receipts. A simplified mode allows for delayed reporting within five days for specific cases.<br><br>Exemptions include municipalities, the Czech National Bank, Czech Post, financial and insurance services, energy sectors, and certain transportation payments. The implementation is phased, starting with accommodation and catering services in December 2016, followed by retail and wholesale in March 2017, other activities in March 2018, and selected crafts in June 2018. Customer engagement is encouraged through a "receipt lottery."<br><br>The government anticipates reduced tax evasion and increased tax revenue, projecting billions of Czech crowns in additional revenue. However, opposition parties criticize the system as a burden on small businesses and a step towards excessive state control, similar to Orwellian surveillance. The long-term impact on the business environment remains to be seen.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_298" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_298" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_298" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_299" style="display:none;">In Austria, companies exceeding a legally defined revenue threshold are obligated to use a cash register system as of May 2016. This requirement has been a subject of extensive debate, with some small business owners challenging it at the Constitutional Court, arguing it infringes upon property rights and freedom of trade, and imposes an undue financial burden. However, the Constitutional Court upheld the regulation, deeming cash registers an effective tool to reduce revenue manipulation and tax evasion, aligning with public interest and not imposing disproportionate restrictions on business freedoms.<br><br>The obligation to implement a cash register system in 2016 is triggered by reaching €15,000 in total revenue and over €7,500 in cash revenue. The requirement becomes effective four months after the tax period in which these thresholds are first exceeded. For example, revenue generated in January 2016 necessitates cash register use from June 2016. Austria's Finance Minister has indicated a potential increase of the revenue threshold to €30,000.<br><br>VAT payers with quarterly tax periods and lower revenues may have delayed obligations. If the revenue threshold is met in March 2016 for a quarterly filer, cash register use starts in July 2016. Reaching it in June pushes the obligation to October 2016, and reaching it in September 2016 defers the obligation to January 1, 2017.<br><br>Companies exceeding €30,000 in prior year revenue file VAT quarterly, while those exceeding €100,000 file monthly. Furthermore, all Austrian entrepreneurs (excluding vending machines until January 1, 2017) are mandated to issue a cash receipt for every cash transaction since January 1, 2016. These receipts must include company identification, document number, date, item description, quantity, and the cash payment amount. Businesses must retain a copy of each receipt for seven years.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_299" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_299" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_299" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_303" style="display:none;">The Accounting Act was amended in 2015 by Act No. 130/2015, with staggered effective dates of July 1, 2015, January 1, 2016, and January 1, 2017. This summary highlights key changes effective January 1, 2016.<br><br>The definition of shareholding has been clarified to mean at least a twenty percent stake in another accounting entity held to foster a permanent link and contribute to the entity's activities. Public administration entities and self-employed individuals are no longer the sole entities barred from using a fiscal year; legal entities with state, municipal, or higher territorial self-governing unit ownership stakes are also excluded.<br><br>The format of the interim profit and loss statement now requires reporting information from the beginning of the accounting period up to the interim reporting date, as well as data from the immediately preceding period. Annual report requirements have been modified, including the scope of auditor verification. New provisions mandate large entities in extractive industries or forest clearing to publish annual reports on payments to public authorities, with exceptions for minor payments.<br><br>Consolidated financial statement obligations have been adjusted, excluding parent companies that do not meet size requirements or if obtaining information would be excessively costly or if subsidiary stakes are held solely for resale. The deadline for filing approved financial statements is now one year after the end of the accounting period.<br><br>The definition of acquisition cost now includes all related expenses and subsequent reductions. The valuation using reproduction acquisition cost is removed and replaced by fair value. New rules allow for the valuation of securities and shares intended for sale at fair value. Goodwill and capitalized development costs with indeterminate lifespans must now be amortized within five years. New accounting procedures effective December 31, 2015, also redefine accounts for receivables and payables related to shareholdings and interconnected entities, and address accounting for receivables and payables in restructuring cases and sponsorship claims.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_303" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_303" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_303" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_308" style="display:none;">If your answers to the following questions are affirmatively at least twice, transfer documentation should be a priority for your business!<br><br>Based on publicly available sources as well as the practical experience of our department, we offer you a small test.<br><br>1. Have you been incurring losses in recent tax periods? Is your overall gross profit margin or pre-tax profit margin relatively low or showing a downward trend? Long-term company losses without changes in business policy may indicate that the entity's business activities do not reflect the objective reality of its operations.<br><br>2. In the notes to the financial statements, in section N, do you only provide partial information regarding transactions with related parties? Incomplete information indicates either an intent to conceal information or a lack of sufficient attention to transfer pricing policy.<br><br>3. Do you have significant transactions with related parties located in a country with a lower tax burden? The more significant the transactions with jurisdictions having lower or zero tax rates, the higher the risk of profit shifting.<br><br>4. Does the total amount of royalties paid to other members of a multinational group in the tax period exceed 5% of your turnover or 30% of your operating profit before deducting royalties? Royalties are a risk area because determining their amount based on the arm's length principle is significantly more complex than for goods transactions. It is also important to assess whether economic benefits truly accrue from these royalties to individual group members.<br><br>5. Does the total amount of fees for services paid to other members of a multinational group in the tax period exceed 5% of your turnover or 10% of your operating profit? Services received represent a significant cost item. If their amount is high, there is a risk that costs were allocated to the tax entity without real economic benefit, solely for the purpose of reducing the tax base.<br><br>6. Does the total amount of interest paid in the tax period on loans or credits received from other members of a multinational group exceed 25% of your operating profit, or does debt financing represent more than 70% of total financing? The higher the proportion of debt financing from intra-group loans, the greater the financial dependence on the group, and thus the greater the interventions expected in transfer pricing policy.<br><br>7. Do you achieve significantly lower profitability compared to industry averages or other members of the group? Deviations from average industry values can often mean that transfer pricing has been adjusted, and such situations frequently require closer examination.<br><br>8. Have you carried out significant corporate restructurings during the tax period? The impacts of corporate restructurings can be extensive, as they involve the transfer of profit potential between countries, thus affecting the amount of tax paid in subsequent tax periods.<br><br>The tax administration uses various internal and external information sources to assess risky transactions from a transfer pricing perspective. Our specialists from the international taxation department will gladly assist you with preparing the documentation.<br><br>---<br><br>This article suggests that if a business answers affirmatively to at least two of the presented questions, it should prioritize transfer documentation. The test comprises eight key areas that indicate potential transfer pricing risks. These include sustained losses, incomplete disclosure of related-party transactions, transactions with low-tax jurisdictions, significant royalty or service fee payments to group members, high levels of intra-group debt financing, lower profitability compared to industry peers, and corporate restructurings. The article highlights that the tax administration utilizes both internal and external information to evaluate these high-risk transactions, emphasizing the need for proper documentation to address potential scrutiny and profit shifting concerns. Specialists in international taxation are available to provide assistance with documentation preparation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_308" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_308" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_308" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_309" style="display:none;">The procedure for issuing protective opinions against the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) and the rules for reporting tax schemes (MDR) are distinct but share the common goal of counteracting tax avoidance. The Chief of the National Tax Administration (KAS) is responsible for issuing protective opinions and should ensure a uniform interpretation of tax regulations for both GAAR and MDR.<br><br>Both mechanisms aim to prevent tax avoidance. GAAR allows tax authorities to challenge tax consequences if the primary or one of the main purposes of an action was to gain a tax benefit, and the method was artificial. MDR mandates the reporting of arrangements that could lead to tax benefits if they meet specific general characteristics. The crucial "main benefit" criterion, which signifies the primary motive for an arrangement, is central to both. In MDR, it determines the reporting obligation when a general characteristic is present, while in GAAR, it is a condition for applying the rule.<br><br>The main benefit criterion is met if a reasonable person, aiming for non-tax objectives, would choose a different course of action without the tax benefit, and if the tax benefit is the main or a principal anticipated gain from the arrangement. This involves three key elements: the tax benefit itself, the taxpayer's motivation for seeking it, and the existence of a reasonable alternative path without such a benefit.<br><br>The text highlights that even legal actions may be subject to MDR reporting if the tax benefit was the main motive and an alternative existed. GAAR, however, requires actions to be artificial or economically unjustified. Importantly, the absence of a reasonable alternative can prevent the main benefit criterion from being met in MDR, especially if the chosen structure is economically rational for non-tax reasons. Conversely, if the sole purpose is tax benefit and actions are artificial, the criterion is met.<br><br>Ultimately, while MDR and GAAR are separate legal institutions, their shared purpose in combating tax abuse necessitates a unified interpretation of their provisions, particularly concerning the main benefit criterion and the analysis of economic justification. This consistency is vital for legal certainty and taxpayer protection.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_309" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_309" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_309" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_310" style="display:none;">Work seniority plays a crucial role in labor law, influencing benefits like seniority allowances and jubilee awards. With frequent amendments to the Labor Code, lawmakers are increasingly refining how work seniority is calculated to align with modern employment realities. These changes, particularly regarding the inclusion of periods worked under civil law contracts, are of great interest to both employers and employees.<br><br>Currently, work seniority primarily includes periods of employment under contracts of employment, selection, appointment, and commission. It also encompasses periods of education. However, this practice leads to unequal treatment of employees, especially those who have worked under different legal frameworks than standard employment contracts.<br><br>On June 24, 2025, the Council of Ministers adopted a project from the Ministry of Family, Labor, and Social Policy. This groundbreaking initiative aims to revolutionize access to many employee entitlements and equalize opportunities for all workers, regardless of their contractual arrangements.<br><br>The proposed changes intend to include not only periods of employment and service but also periods of work and business activities that were subject to social insurance contributions. This includes periods of self-employment, working for self-employed individuals, performing mandate contracts or service contracts, agency agreements, and periods of business activity suspension for childcare purposes where social insurance contributions were paid.<br><br>Proof of work seniority will be provided through certificates issued by the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) for periods subject to reporting, and through general rules of evidence for periods not reported to ZUS or for foreign work activities. The new regulations are set to take effect on January 1, 2026, allowing employers time to adjust their internal regulations and financial provisions for a smooth implementation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_310" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_310" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_310" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_311" style="display:none;">The minimal income tax in CIT (Corporate Income Tax) is a new tax obligation effective from the beginning of 2024 in Poland. Companies must strategically choose between the classic or simplified method of calculating the tax base. The classic method calculates the tax base by adding 1.5% of revenues, debt financing costs to related entities exceeding 30% of EBITDA, and costs of acquiring intangible services from related entities or tax havens exceeding 3 million PLN plus 5% of EBITDA. The simplified method sets the tax base at 3% of revenues. The choice depends on the cost structure, profitability, and tax risks.<br><br>The classic method allows for the consideration of actual operating costs and is preferable for entities with high EBITDA and low intra-group transaction costs, but is complex and prone to transfer pricing errors. The simplified method is straightforward and attractive for low-profitability entities with substantial intangible costs but doesn't allow for real operating cost deductions. Deductions from the tax base include reliefs specified in Article 18 of the CIT Act, income exempt from operations in PSI/SSE, and income excluded under Article 24ca para. 2.<br><br>The tax is declared and paid by the end of the third month following the tax year's end, and any overpayment can be deducted over the next three years. Taxpayers achieving a profitability rate above 2% in 2024 may be exempt from the minimum tax for 2025-2027. Businesses with significant intra-group costs or low profitability should consider the simplified method, while those with high EBITDA and transparent related-party transactions may benefit from the classic approach. The minimum tax requires careful cost policy and transfer pricing verification.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_311" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_311" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_311" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_312" style="display:none;">This article discusses the tax implications of a loan granted by a shareholder to a capital company, specifically focusing on whether it should be subject to the tax on civil law transactions (PCC) or value-added tax (VAT).<br><br>Generally, loan agreements are subject to PCC at a rate of 0.5% of the loan amount. However, the PCC law exempts loans granted by a shareholder to a capital company, provided the shareholder is not conducting business activities. Tax authorities maintain that if the shareholder is also an entrepreneur, the loan is subject to VAT as a paid service, regardless of whether the shareholder's business is related to lending.<br><br>Administrative courts, however, offer a different perspective. They argue that if the shareholder grants the loan within the scope of their business activity, it's subject to VAT. If the shareholder isn't involved in financial activities and the loan is incidental, it should be subject to PCC. Regardless, VAT law provides an exemption for services related to granting loans. Therefore, a VAT-registered shareholder providing a loan to a capital company may not be obligated to pay VAT.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_312" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_312" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_312" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_313" style="display:none;">Estonian CIT and MDR raise concerns among entrepreneurs planning restructuring. The key question is where legal tax planning ends and the obligation to report a scheme begins. The Estonian CIT is intended to promote investment, development, and capital accumulation, not just optimization. Reorganizations preceding the adoption of Estonian CIT can trigger MDR reporting obligations if they primarily aim for tax benefits rather than business reasons.<br><br>The "main benefit test" in MDR is met if the primary goal is to obtain a tax advantage, outweighing economic objectives. The existence of an "alternative route" to achieve the same economic effect with less tax advantage also indicates the main benefit test is met. The Head of the National Fiscal Administration (Szef KAS) may deem actions artificial if a simpler, more tax-neutral approach was available but not chosen.<br><br>A favorable ruling example involved a reorganization with property acquisition, division, and new operating companies, deemed acceptable due to prevailing economic goals. Conversely, a negative ruling cited artificial transactions lacking business purpose, aimed at circumventing CIT regulations, leading to potential GAAR application. Actions must have economic sense. MDR reporting is required when the reorganization leads to significant tax benefits, lacks justification in actual business activity, and meets scheme hallmarks. Transparent documentation and a balance between tax and economic motivation are crucial. Estonian CIT is for investing firms, not aggressive optimizers. If tax deferral or avoidance is the main benefit, MDR or GAAR risks arise.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_313" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_313" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_313" style="display:none;"></p>

They need audits that offer real support in management and development, emphasizing flexibility, efficiency, timeliness, and consistent communication. As these companies grow, they must transition from simplified management and accounting to more professional methods. Audits should go beyond formal evaluations, providing insights for managerial decisions.<br><br>A well-conducted audit, especially by auditors experienced with similar-sized firms, helps owners and managers understand the importance of aligning accounting policies with their operational scale, impacting management quality and providing investors with reliable decision-making foundations. Many medium-sized firms focus solely on tax accounting, leading to inaccurate financial assessments. A proactively managed balance sheet policy is essential for comprehensive reporting and effective management. Auditors play a crucial role in discussing, implementing, and monitoring appropriate presentation and valuation options.<br><br>Direct auditor contact is vital. Many medium-sized companies seeking new auditors cite difficulty reaching the lead auditor and high team turnover as problems. Consistent audit teams and direct contact with the lead auditor are essential for trust, continuous communication, and a deeper understanding of the company's operations, enabling proactive responses to changing circumstances and advisory support. Modern tools shorten audit times and precisely identify risks. Audits should assess more than just financial data.<br><br>One audit uncovered cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a manufacturing firm, which were addressed before causing significant losses. Tailored audits are investments in the future, with auditors understanding business realities and identifying risks to inform decisions.

Increased protectionism and the use of tariffs can force businesses to adjust their transfer pricing strategies to mitigate tax burdens and maintain competitiveness.<br><br>Companies may need to modify supply chains, adjust intercompany margins, revise pricing agreements, and re-evaluate their transfer pricing policies to optimize tax and customs obligations while adhering to international regulations. This includes analyzing new risks, updating benchmarking analyses, relocating production, and reassessing transaction profitability.

This means you no longer have to wonder where money disappears or spend hours manually analyzing data.<br><br>In this article, you'll learn how the Owner's Dashboard can help your company:<br>optimize costs and increase profitability,<br>track cash flow and avoid liquidity problems,<br>automate reporting and save time.<br><br>Managing a company based on data rather than guesswork helps avoid wrong decisions and develop your business more effectively. Discover how to implement the Owner's Dashboard and better manage your company's finances.<br><br>Managing a business without data is a risk you cannot afford. Many business owners make decisions based on intuition. While this might work in the early stages of a business, managing finances becomes increasingly complex as the company grows. Lack of access to current, reliable data leads to suboptimal decisions, financial losses, and liquidity problems. How, then, can you effectively monitor key financial indicators, analyze profitability, and make better decisions? The answer is the Owner's Dashboard – a modern analytical tool that provides entrepreneurs with a comprehensive overview of their company's condition.<br><br>Many companies use several different accounting systems, Excel spreadsheets, or invoicing tools. Gathering data from these sources takes time, and their analysis is often chaotic, failing to provide a complete picture. This results in a lack of reliable information for decision-making and delays in responding to market changes. The Owner's Dashboard integrates data from various systems and presents it clearly, eliminating the need for manual reporting and enabling quick conclusions. This allows entrepreneurs to focus on strategic aspects of running their business instead of wasting time analyzing scattered information.<br><br>The Owner's Dashboard provides precise information about: the most profitable clients and services, the profitability of individual projects, and costs and their impact on operating margins. This enables informed decisions about eliminating unprofitable activities, optimizing costs, and better resource allocation. Liquidity problems are a major cause of business failures. Lack of cash flow control leads to situations where a company cannot meet its obligations, even if it shows a profit on paper. The Owner's Dashboard allows continuous monitoring of cash flows, forecasting future expenses and income, and identifying potential threats to financial stability. Traditional financial reporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The Owner's Dashboard automates the reporting process, integrating data from accounting systems, CRM, and invoicing tools. All key information is available in one place, allowing for quick decision-making and eliminating errors from manual data processing.<br><br>Controlling costs is as important as increasing revenue. Many businesses lack full insight into their spending structure, missing opportunities to optimize margins. The Owner's Dashboard allows for cost analysis by category, identification of inefficient spending, and optimization of the cost structure to increase profitability. The implementation process involves a financial audit, integration with accounting systems, and report configuration to automate analysis and improve data control.<br><br>Managing a company without reliable financial data is a risk that can lead to losses and liquidity problems. The Owner's Dashboard provides comprehensive information for effective financial management and sound business decisions. If you want full control over your company's financial situation, eliminate unnecessary costs, and automate reporting, the Owner's Dashboard is the solution you need.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_319" style="display:none;">The Polish Tax Ordinance defines three types of tax schemes subject to mandatory reporting to the Head of the National Fiscal Administration (KAS): tax schemes, standardized tax schemes, and cross-border tax schemes. A tax scheme is defined when one of the following occurs: the arrangement meets the main benefit test and possesses a general distinguishing feature (both must be met); the arrangement possesses a specific distinguishing feature (the main benefit test is not required); or the arrangement possesses another specific distinguishing feature (the main benefit test is also not required).<br><br>The main benefit test is met if, based on existing circumstances, a reasonable entity, guided by lawful objectives other than achieving a tax benefit, could have reasonably chosen an alternative course of action that would not result in the reasonably expected tax benefit from the arrangement. The tax benefit must be the main or one of the main benefits expected from the arrangement. A tax benefit includes non-creation, deferral, or reduction of tax liability, creation or overstatement of tax loss, creation of overpayment or right to tax refund, overstatement of overpayment or refund amount, and avoidance of tax collection by a payer.<br><br>The main benefit test is assessed considering whether a tax benefit exists, whether it is a primary motivator for the arrangement, and whether there was an alternative, reasonable course of action without the tax benefit. The explanation clarifies that utilizing legally provided tax reliefs and preferences generally does not trigger reporting obligations, unless the primary motivation is tax avoidance and an alternative route exists. Examples include economically justified expenses as costs of revenue. However, artificial arrangements like B2B employment without economic justification or contract splitting to utilize lower tax rates may meet the main benefit test. The analysis should objectively compare the taxpayer's situation before and after the arrangement, considering whether a rational entity would engage in the arrangement absent the expected tax benefit. The Minister of Finance confirmed the same.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_319" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_319" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_319" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_320" style="display:none;">The Polish legal framework for reporting tax schemes (MDR) is established in the Tax Ordinance, specifically in Chapter 11a of Title III, Articles 86a to 86o. These provisions, effective from January 1, 2019, implement Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 (DAC6), mandating the automatic exchange of information on reportable cross-border tax arrangements. The global necessity for MDR arises from weaknesses in national tax systems that facilitate Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) by multinational corporations, leading to a loss of tax revenue and eroding trust in fiscal systems.<br><br>MDR serves as a tool to combat tax avoidance, aligning with the OECD's Action 12 recommendations. Its core objectives are transparency and prevention, aiming to provide tax authorities with comprehensive information on potentially aggressive tax planning. This allows for swift identification and mitigation of tax loopholes and harmful practices, as highlighted by the Luxleaks scandal. By equipping tax administrations with timely data on tax schemes, MDR enables more accurate risk assessment, targeted audits, and proactive legislative responses. This ultimately protects state revenues and ensures fair competition by preventing businesses from gaining an unfair advantage through aggressive tax planning. The system also aims to deter tax advisors and taxpayers from engaging in such schemes and provides valuable data for analyzing the effectiveness of tax reliefs. While the EU is standardizing information exchange, the report by the European Court of Auditors indicates that the effective utilization of this data for risk analysis remains a challenge for tax administrations.<br><br>The Polish legal framework for reporting tax schemes (MDR) is based on the Tax Ordinance and implements EU Directive DAC6.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_321" style="display:none;">Gender equality, pay transparency, and increased female representation in leadership are not just contemporary business challenges but also crucial elements for sustainable development. For over three decades, Moore Polska has demonstrated that women are the foundation of organizational success, shaping its history, strategy, and inspiring future generations of leaders.<br><br>To mark Women's Day, Moore Polska highlights the vital role of women, discusses recent EU regulations on gender equality and pay transparency, and expresses gratitude for their contributions. The company's history is intrinsically linked to women's dedication, expertise, and vision, which have driven its growth as a leading audit and advisory firm in Poland.<br><br>Founded in 1989 and expanded in 1992, Moore Polska now employs over 270 people, with women comprising more than 80%. These women are instrumental in the organization's management and strategic direction, fostering innovation and professional development.<br><br>The European Union has introduced new regulations to promote gender equality. The "Women on Boards" directive (2022) mandates that by June 2026, listed companies must have at least 40% women on supervisory boards or 33% in total management positions. The pay transparency directive (2023/970) aims to close the gender pay gap by requiring salary reporting, granting employees access to pay information, prohibiting pay secrecy clauses, and mandating corrective actions for significant gender pay disparities.<br><br>Gender equality is vital for business, leading to better financial performance, higher employee engagement, talent attraction, and increased innovation. Moore Polska actively promotes equal opportunities, gender diversity, and pay transparency, with women holding 82% of positions and 83% of director roles. The company thanks all women for their dedication and contributions, wishing them continued success and fulfillment.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_321" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_321" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_321" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_322" style="display:none;">A recent survey of manufacturing leaders by Make UK indicates that 2025 will be another challenging year, with rising costs and economic pressures testing their resilience. However, the study also highlights significant opportunities, as 50% of companies plan to increase investment in new product development, market expansion, and talent growth. These investments are partly driven by the belief that technology, particularly automation, can boost productivity and mitigate the impact of upcoming increases in national insurance contributions and the minimum wage.<br><br>Despite this optimistic outlook, uncertainty remains a major hurdle, preventing companies from fully realizing their investment potential. A significant majority (57%) are waiting for a government-backed industrial strategy before committing to increased investment. This reactive approach can lead to stalled plans for automation, innovation, and expansion if such a strategy never materializes. The article emphasizes the importance of proactive, strategic planning, particularly a three- to five-year plan, to navigate disruptions and ensure sustainable growth. Businesses that focus solely on the next 12-24 months are more vulnerable than those with a longer-term vision.<br><br>Sustainability is presented as a strong foundation for long-term planning, encouraging a focus on lasting value and operational optimization, which can lead to lower costs, access to growing markets, and improved employee retention. The article also stresses the need for introspection, asking critical questions about a company's current state, future vision, and the changes required to achieve it. This includes the potential need for restructuring. The Polish manufacturing sector faces similar challenges of regulatory uncertainty and rising costs, making strategic business planning and investment in efficiency and automation crucial for competitive advantage. Ultimately, the message is clear: manufacturers must take control of their future by investing in innovation, prioritizing sustainability, and planning strategically, transforming 2025 from a year of uncertainty into one of transformation and growth.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_322" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_322" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_322" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_324" style="display:none;">New ESG regulations represent a breakthrough for entrepreneurs, promising reduced bureaucracy, lower administrative costs, and enhanced access to green financing. The European Commission has simplified reporting obligations, eased burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and facilitated capital acquisition for sustainable development, as announced on February 26, 2025. These changes aim to make ESG compliance more manageable and beneficial.<br><br>Key reforms include a significant reduction in reporting duties, excluding approximately 80% of companies from ESG reporting under the CSRD directive, primarily benefiting smaller businesses. Reporting deadlines are deferred to 2028, allowing firms more time to adapt, and the scope of reporting is narrowed to focus on essential business aspects. This simplification is expected to save EU companies over €6 billion annually and attract an additional €50 billion in investments.<br><br>Furthermore, access to sustainable financing is improved through voluntary ESG reporting incentives, a 70% reduction in reporting forms, and simplified "do no significant harm" (DNSH) criteria. Changes to due diligence requirements (CSDDD) focus on direct business partners and reduce monitoring frequency, with relaxed obligations for SMEs. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) also sees simplification, exempting 90% of small importers and streamlining emissions reporting. The reform also includes an additional €50 billion for green investments. Ultimately, adopting ESG strategies is presented not just as an obligation but as a competitive advantage, fostering investor interest, customer loyalty, and long-term stability.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_324" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_324" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_324" style="display:none;"></p>

This updated system aims to align Polish economic activity classifications with evolving market, technological, and social realities, as well as harmonize economic statistics across the European Union, particularly in areas like the digital, circular, and bio-economies.<br><br>The changes involve reorganizing and segregating economic sectors and activities for better clarity and ease of identification. This includes adding new classification symbols, dividing or merging existing ones, modifying the wording of certain groups to expand or narrow their scope, and relocating some sub-classes. New groupings have also been created for activities not previously separately distinguished.<br><br>For businesses, new entities starting after January 1, 2025, will use PKD 2025. Existing businesses have two years to update their PKD codes. Failure to do so will result in automatic reclassification based on transition keys developed by GUS.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_328" style="display:none;">A new amendment to the Accounting Act, effective January 1, 2025, introduces significant changes regarding the sale of materials, impacting financial statements for periods starting after December 31, 2023. Previously, many entities didn't deeply differentiate between goods and materials due to a lack of significant consequences and necessary tools.<br><br>The core challenges lie in precisely defining and distinguishing between goods (purchased for resale in their original form) and materials (acquired for own consumption). This distinction becomes complex in scenarios involving items used for both internal needs and resale, like production waste sold as scrap, or spare parts for machinery that are also sold.<br><br>The amendment mandates a retrospective application of these changes, generally requiring a full retrospective approach unless practically impossible. This means restating prior periods, which can be technically challenging, potentially requiring system adjustments and careful estimation of impacts. Companies must diligently implement these changes to ensure compliance and accurate financial reporting, even if it requires significant effort to adapt accounting and reporting tools. The lack of precise estimation does not justify ignoring the changes.<br><br>audyt,sprzedaż materiałów,UoR,ustawa o rachunkowości,zmiany</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_328" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_328" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_328" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_334" style="display:none;">Voluntary share redemption without remuneration may trigger transfer pricing documentation requirements if thresholds are met and related parties are identified. A controlled transaction is defined as economic activities, including income allocation to a foreign establishment, where conditions are set or imposed due to relationships. This broad definition aims to encompass situations not typically considered transactions.<br><br>Related parties are entities where one has a significant influence over another, or where the same entity, a spouse, relative, or business partner exerts significant influence. Significant influence is defined as holding at least 25% of shares or voting rights, having the actual ability to impact key economic decisions, or being in a marital or close familial relationship.<br><br>The Ministry of Finance, aligning with Supreme Administrative Court rulings, considers voluntary share redemption without remuneration a controlled transaction. This is because the conditions of such a redemption could be influenced or imposed by existing relationships between shareholders. The Court emphasizes that a shareholder voluntarily agreeing to gratuitous disposal of shares, thereby divesting assets, may lack economic rationality, suggesting underlying relationships dictate such actions. This economic activity, even if unpaid due to shareholder and company agreement, is subject to transfer pricing regulations if related parties are involved and documentation thresholds are exceeded.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_334" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_334" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_334" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_335" style="display:none;">In December 2024, a draft law on supported decision-making instruments was introduced in Poland, aiming to completely replace the existing legal concept of legal incapacitation (ubezwłasnowolnienie). The intention is to create a less formal system that maximizes freedom for individuals needing assistance in managing their affairs due to various reasons. The proposed legislation is currently undergoing review, with the government targeting its implementation by 2026 at the latest.<br><br>The new law will introduce three models of supported decision-making, adaptable to the individual's condition and needs. These models can apply to individuals with disabilities, the elderly, the sick, or anyone who feels they require support or cannot fully manage their affairs independently. The three proposed models are: Legal Assistance, Supportive Guardianship, and Representative Guardianship.<br><br>Legal Assistance will be a new type of contract where a supported individual and a supporter agree on assistance, such as attending legal actions, explaining legal matters, gathering information, and communicating declarations of intent. Supportive Guardianship will function similarly but will be established by a court that defines the guardian's powers and duties. Representative Guardianship, the most extensive form, will grant the guardian the power to act on behalf of the supported individual, either directly or by approving their actions. For significant matters concerning property or the individual, the Representative Guardian will require prior court consent. Additionally, a "future power of attorney" will allow adults to appoint someone to manage their affairs should they become unable to do so themselves, with powers potentially exceeding even Representative Guardianship, though also requiring court approval for major decisions. Existing guardians of legally incapacitated individuals will automatically become Representative Guardians upon the law's enactment.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_335" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_335" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_335" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_336" style="display:none;">Modern business faces the challenge of addressing global environmental protection needs, social responsibility, and sustainable management. In this context, ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) and the EU Taxonomy play a crucial role, setting standards for environmentally friendly investments and activities. This article delves into ESG principles and the EU Taxonomy, their interconnections, and their significance for businesses.<br><br>ESG, an acronym for Environmental, Social, and Governance, assesses a company's activities based on their impact on the environment, society, and management. Amidst climate change and increasing regulatory demands, ESG has become a fundamental indicator of responsible business. The EU Taxonomy, a set of regulations defining environmentally sustainable economic activities, is particularly important in this transformation.<br><br>The EU Taxonomy, established in June 2020, aims to facilitate sustainable investments by defining which investments align with ESG principles and environmental goals. It combats greenwashing and directs capital towards eco-friendly actions. To be considered sustainable under the Taxonomy and ESG, an economic activity must contribute to at least one of six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable water and marine resource use, circular economy transition, pollution prevention and control, and biodiversity and ecosystem protection. Crucially, these activities must not cause significant harm to any other environmental objective, comply with minimum safeguards (including human and labor rights), and meet specific technical screening criteria.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_338" style="display:none;">This article analyzes the taxation of income from contributions in kind (aport) to a company by an individual partner, particularly when a portion of the aport is allocated to the reserve capital. An aport is any non-monetary contribution with an assessable asset value that increases the company's economic potential.<br><br>According to the Personal Income Tax Act, contributions in kind to cover or increase share capital are considered income from capital for the partner, based on the value stated in the company's articles of association or similar document. If the stated value is lower than the market value, the market value of the aport is considered income. Some interpretations suggest that allocating a portion of the aport to the reserve capital doesn't change the tax implications, as the entire market value is still considered income.<br><br>However, another viewpoint presented in tax rulings treats the contribution in kind as a form of compensated disposal of assets. It states that in order for the aport to be treated as a compensated disposal, the partner needs to receive shares or stocks from the company.<br>The taxation of aport, especially when part of it is allocated to reserve capital, is not clearly defined in tax laws or precedents.<br>A compelling argument to consider only the aport value allocated to the company's share capital as income stems from Article 30b(1)(1) of the PIT Act, which specifies a 19% tax on income from acquiring shares or stocks in exchange for a contribution in kind.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_338" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_338" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_338" style="display:none;"></p>

The question is whether these entrepreneurs can deduct such donations from their income.<br><br>According to CIT regulations, the tax base can be reduced by donations made for purposes outlined in the Public Benefit and Volunteer Work Act, specifically aiding victims of disasters, natural disasters, armed conflicts, and wars, both domestically and abroad. However, these donations must be given to organizations mentioned in the act, which includes non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as foundations and associations, but not entities within the public finance sector.<br><br>Municipalities, being units of local government, are classified as entities within the public finance sector according to the Act on Public Finances. Tax authorities state that a donation is deductible only if it serves the purposes mentioned in the Public Benefit and Volunteer Work Act and is given to an NGO, which excludes entities in the public finance sector.<br><br>A proposed amendment in September 2024 suggested allowing deductions for donations to local government units (LGUs) for flood victims, but this proposal was not enacted.

Tax regulations allow deductions only for donations to NGOs, not to entities within the public finance sector. Municipalities are classified as part of the public finance sector. The donation must serve purposes outlined in the Public Benefit and Volunteer Work Act, such as aiding disaster victims. While a proposed amendment to allow deductions for donations to LGUs was considered, it was ultimately not implemented. Thus, current tax law does not permit deducting donations made directly to municipalities, despite the charitable intent, limiting tax relief to donations made to qualified NGOs instead.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_339" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_339" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_339" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_340" style="display:none;">Poland has implemented the global minimum tax law, effective January 1, 2025, to align with the OECD's Pillar II and EU Directive 2022/2523. This tax targets multinational and large domestic groups with consolidated annual revenues exceeding €750 million in at least two of the four preceding fiscal years. The goal is to ensure fair taxation where businesses operate, curbing profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions.<br><br>The law introduces three types of top-up tax: Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT), and Undertaxed Profit Rule (UTPR). IIR applies to parent entities, QDMTT is collected in countries where low-taxed constituent entities are located, and UTPR applies where the parent entity operates in a jurisdiction without IIR or QDMTT.<br><br>Exemptions include governmental entities, international organizations, non-profits, pension funds, and investment funds. Tax incentives like Special Economic Zones, Polish Investment Zones, IP BOX, and the 9% CIT rate may significantly affect the top-up tax amount. While the regulations are implemented with a delay compared to some countries, Polish subsidiaries of international groups from countries that have already implemented Pillar 2 will be subject to a review of their effective tax rate for 2024. Companies should prepare for these changes by gathering and analyzing data to assess their tax liabilities.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_340" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_340" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_340" style="display:none;"></p>

This tax, part of the global minimum tax level, will cover a wide range of entities but also includes numerous exclusions and exemptions.<br><br>The equalization tax applies to multinational enterprise groups with subsidiaries in other countries, including Poland, if the parent entity is based outside of Poland; multinational groups with subsidiaries in other countries where the parent company is based in Poland; and domestic groups operating solely in Poland. Unlike OECD model rules, this tax applies not only to multinational groups but also to groups where all qualified entities are based in a member state like Poland.<br><br>Exemptions include taxpayers who are not qualified entities of multinational or domestic groups, taxpayers who are part of multinational or domestic groups with consolidated revenues not exceeding €750 million at least twice in the four years preceding the tax year, or groups that existed for less than four tax years but have exceeded that revenue threshold in at least two years. Governmental bodies, international organizations, non-profit organizations, pension funds, investment funds, real estate investment entities, and entities where at least 95% of the nominal value of their shares is held by exempt entities are also excluded. Furthermore, entities where at least 85% of the nominal value of their shares is held by exempt entities, provided that almost all of their income comes from tax-exempt dividends, are also exempt.<br><br>Significant changes have been introduced following public consultations, including clarifying which taxes in Poland will qualify, such as CIT, withholding tax, tax on income from virtual currency sales, controlled foreign company tax, tax on shifted profits, tax on income from buildings, minimum tax under Article 24ca of the CIT Act, tax on qualified income from intellectual property rights (IP Box), and tax on income from unrealized gains.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_341" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_341" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_341" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_343" style="display:none;">The end of the year is approaching, and new regulations regarding the global minimum tax are coming into effect on January 1, 2025. A short survey helps determine if the equalization tax law will apply to your company. A detailed analysis of Pillar 2 regulations is crucial to ascertain whether your business is subject to these new rules. Early identification enables effective budget and resource planning, essential for well-targeted strategies. Early action allows finance departments to gather data necessary for calculating global or national minimum tax and determining payment obligations.<br><br>A multinational or large domestic group with consolidated annual revenues exceeding EUR 750,000,000 will be subject to the new regulations, provided it surpassed this threshold in at least two of the four years preceding the tax year. This threshold aligns with the country-by-country reporting requirements, allowing Polish companies to verify compliance by checking past CBC-P reporting obligations. Determining if a company will be subject to Pillar 2 requires considering consolidated group revenues from 2021-2024. In 2024, Polish firms must fulfill aspects of the new regulations, necessitating an analysis of financial situations from 2020-2023.<br><br>The global minimum tax aims to ensure international firms pay fair taxes where they operate, eliminating aggressive tax optimization. The draft law introduces three types of equalization tax: the global equalization tax (IIR), where the group's parent entity pays the tax on itself and its low-taxed subsidiaries; the domestic equalization tax (QDMTT), levied in the country where low-taxed components of the group are located; and the equalization tax on insufficiently taxed profits (UTPR), applied when the parent entity operates in a jurisdiction without IIR or the tax wasn't collected under QDMTT. Although Polish lawmakers haven't implemented it, international groups in countries with Pillar 2 (Austria, Belgium, France) must consider the effective tax rate of Polish subsidiaries for 2024, requiring extensive data gathering. If operating in Poland as part of an international structure, assess your company's tax obligations now to prepare for the changes.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_343" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_343" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_343" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_345" style="display:none;">A sole shareholder of a limited liability company (LLC), even holding 99% of the shares, is not considered to be conducting non-agricultural business activity and is therefore not subject to social security contributions. This is the conclusion reached in a Supreme Court Resolution dated February 21, 2024. The Court clarified that the provision in the Social Insurance System Act defining "a shareholder of a single-member limited liability company" refers strictly to a company where all shares belong to one shareholder according to commercial law.<br><br>Previously, courts had reached similar conclusions, but there was some inconsistency in jurisprudence. One case involved the Lublin Regional Court dismissing a taxpayer's appeal against a Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) decision. ZUS had determined that the individual, owning 99% of the LLC's shares, should be treated as a sole shareholder and thus not subject to mandatory employee social security.<br><br>The Supreme Court emphasized that the law strictly defines who is subject to social security. The key factor is the legal status – whether the company is truly single-member – not the economic significance of a majority shareholding. A shareholder in a two-person LLC, even with 99% ownership, is not considered a sole shareholder and is not subject to social security under this specific provision. The law does not allow for the creation of new categories of insured individuals or the expansion of existing ones through interpretation. Therefore, only the actual sole shareholder of an LLC is subject to mandatory social security contributions.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_345" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_345" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_345" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_346" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Finance has announced the final consultations for the implementation of the National e-Invoice System (KSeF). Previous consultations identified areas for improvement and simplification. Businesses can submit comments on the draft bill until November 19th, and on business solutions until November 22nd.<br><br>KSeF implementation dates have been proposed: February 1, 2026, for businesses exceeding PLN 200 million in sales in 2025, and April 1, 2026, for all other businesses. Some functionalities, like including the KSeF number in payments and penalties for non-compliance, will be postponed to July 31, 2026. Consumer invoices will be allowed through KSeF. For digitally excluded taxpayers with low invoice volumes, the Ministry plans to allow traditional invoice issuance until September 30, 2026. Full technical functionalities will be ensured before the mandatory KSeF introduction. The National Revenue Administration will have access to KSeF data for its cases.<br><br>Logical structures of e-invoices will be modified, including payment terms and the marking of local government units. Attachments to invoices will be permitted for complex data. A new "employee" role will be introduced. The logical structure FA(3) incorporates feedback from businesses and software providers, aiming for stable implementation. The structure FA_RR(1) for VAT RR invoices will also be consulted. API functionality will be adapted for invoice attachments. The final consultations conclude on November 19th and November 22nd for business solutions.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_346" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_346" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_346" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="summary" id="summary_eng_347" style="display:;">The Polish Ministry of Finance has proposed significant changes to property tax regulations, particularly the definition of "building structure" (budowla), effective January 1, 2025. These amendments </p><p class="summary" id="summary_jp_347" style="display:none;"></p><p class="summary" id="summary_cn_347" style="display:none;"></p><p class="summary" id="summary_kr_347" style="display:none;"></p>
      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_347" style="display:none;">The Polish Ministry of Finance has proposed significant changes to property tax regulations, particularly the definition of "building structure" (budowla), effective January 1, 2025. These amendments are a response to a Constitutional Tribunal ruling from July 2023, which found the previous definitions of taxable property (buildings and structures) inconsistent with the Constitution.<br><br>The core issue was a tautological error in the previous legislation, where the definition of a building referenced construction law, which in turn defined an "object of construction" as a building, creating a circular definition. The new proposals aim to establish an autonomous definition of "structure" within the tax law itself, independent of external construction regulations.<br><br>Under the revised definition, structures will encompass specific objects listed in an annex, along with installations and equipment forming a unified technical-utility whole with them. It will also include structural parts of equipment not considered part of a structure, structural components of wind and nuclear power plants, foundations for machinery and equipment distinct from them, and connections to a construction object, provided they are made using building materials.<br><br>Crucially, a structure will now be defined as "made" rather than "erected," which broadens the scope. This change may allow for the taxation of prefabricated, portable items like freestanding equipment or tanks that are placed at a taxpayer's site without requiring further construction work. Examples of new categories of structures include open sports and recreation facilities, water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, shelters, hangars, container facilities permanently attached to the ground, ports, marinas, artificial islands, swimming pools, docks, breakwaters, quays, piers, jetties, and slipways.<br><br>The amendments also clarify the distinction between buildings and structures, especially in complex or heterogeneous objects like multi-functional stadiums. While parts of such complex structures might be classified as buildings and taxed based on area, other components or separate structures within a building, such as utility networks, will still be considered distinct taxable entities, taxed based on their value. The goal is to eliminate disputes arising from overlapping definitions and maintain the existing tax scope for both buildings and structures.<br><br>The Polish Ministry of Finance has presented a draft of changes to property tax regulations, particularly concerning the definition of a "building structure" (budowla), slated to take effect from January 1, 2025. This revision stems from a Constitutional Tribunal ruling in July 2023, which identified inconsistencies between existing definitions of taxable property and the Constitution. The previous legislation suffered from a circular definition of buildings and structures, leading to legal ambiguities.<br><br>The proposed changes introduce an autonomous definition of "structure" within the tax law, eliminating reliance on external construction regulations. A structure will now include specified objects, associated installations, equipment, and their components, as well as foundations and connections, provided they are made with building materials. The shift from "erected" to "made" is significant, potentially allowing for the taxation of prefabricated, portable items as structures.<br><br>The amendments clarify that parts of complex or heterogeneous objects, such as stadiums, may be classified as buildings and taxed by area. However, structures or their parts housed within buildings, like utility networks, will remain distinct taxable entities, assessed by value. This aims to prevent disputes and maintain the current tax scope for both buildings and structures, ensuring greater clarity in property taxation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_347" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_347" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_347" style="display:none;"></p>

Transfer pricing documentation for 2023 must be prepared by the end of October, and the TPR-C declaration filed by the end of November. This process requires meticulous analysis of all transactions with related entities, especially concerning reorganizations with potential tax implications.<br><br>A restructuring, under transfer pricing regulations, involves a significant change in commercial or financial relations coupled with the transfer of functions, assets, or risks between related entities. This is considered a restructuring if the predicted average annual financial result (EBIT) changes by at least 20% over a three-year period post-transfer. Examples include converting a full-risk distributor to a low-risk one, transferring significant intangibles, terminating contracts with asset transfers, or relocating functions. Reorganizations not meeting these criteria are still subject to general transfer pricing principles, even if not classified as a formal restructuring.<br><br>Crucially, compensation for restructuring needs careful consideration, particularly for profit-generating potential transfers. Documentation for restructuring includes identifying pre- and post-restructuring relationships, economic rationale, tax consequences, profit potential shifts, and the necessity and appropriateness of restructuring remuneration. Benchmarking analyses and business justifications are also required. The threshold for local transfer pricing documentation for restructuring is PLN 2 million. Restructuring transactions may also be subject to MDR reporting.<br><br>Moore Polska Tax & Legal offers assistance with all transfer pricing aspects, tailoring services to client needs.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_348" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_348" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_348" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_350" style="display:none;">Article 10(1) of the Polish Act on Counteracting Excessive Delays in Commercial Transactions protects creditors from late payments. It grants creditors a flat-rate compensation of 40 euros for debt recovery costs from the day they become entitled to interest due to the debtor's payment delay. This compensation is due without prior notice to the debtor.<br><br>The compensation is calculated in euros and converted to Polish zlotys using the average exchange rate announced by the National Bank of Poland on the last working day of the month preceding the due date. While beneficial for out-of-court settlements and situations with multiple overdue invoices from the same debtor, claiming the 40-euro compensation may be disadvantageous in court if it increases litigation costs beyond the compensation amount. Higher compensation amounts of 70 and 100 euros are applicable when the value of receivables is higher.<br><br>This law applies to commercial transactions involving paid delivery of goods or services, excluding contracts between businesses and consumers.

This tax operates parallel to the standard CIT, and if both taxes are due in the same year, the minimum tax liability is reduced by the amount of CIT owed, avoiding double taxation.<br><br>The minimum tax applies to companies with Polish tax residency, non-residents operating through foreign establishments in Poland, and domestic capital groups. Non-residents with establishments in Poland must carefully assess their business activities, as the new regulations may affect their income and losses related to these establishments.<br><br>Exemptions exist for new businesses (first two years), companies using Estonian CIT, entities with significantly lower revenues compared to the previous year, companies with simple ownership structures, and those deriving most income from specific activities like international transport or resource extraction.<br><br>The tax base is calculated using one of two methods: either 1.5% of revenue plus certain costs exceeding PLN 3 million and debt financing costs exceeding 30% of EBITDA, or 3% of operating revenue. Taxpayers must choose a method and inform the tax authorities in their annual return. Careful financial analysis and awareness of exemptions are crucial to avoid unnecessary tax burdens. Consulting a tax advisor is recommended.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_354" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_354" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_354" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_355" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Finance has prepared another draft law amending the laws on agricultural tax, local taxes and fees, forest tax, and stamp duty, incorporating comments from public consultations. This draft, dated September 2, 2024, focuses on changes to property and agricultural taxes.<br><br>Regarding property tax, the primary changes concern the definitions of "building" and "structure." The Ombudsman pointed out that the draft still references construction law rather than tax laws, potentially causing controversy based on a Constitutional Tribunal ruling that requires precise definition of taxable objects to avoid taxpayer uncertainty. The new definition of a building emphasizes a structure resulting from construction works, permanently attached to the ground, enclosed, with foundations and a roof, excluding storage facilities for bulk, loose, liquid, or gaseous materials where capacity is the key parameter. The definition of "structure" includes objects listed in the annex to the law, wind, nuclear, and photovoltaic power plants, energy storage, boilers, industrial furnaces, cable cars, ski lifts, ski jumps (only construction parts), construction equipment (connections, sewage treatment), industrial equipment (construction parts), and machinery foundations.<br><br>For agricultural tax, changes involve subject exemptions, specifically removing the application-based exemptions outlined in Article 12(2) of the Agricultural Tax Act, which currently exempts entities like universities and research institutes. The justification for this change is that the current application process is overly bureaucratic, as the exemption is based solely on the entity's legal status (university, research institute, etc.) which doesn't require verification through a taxpayer's application.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_355" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_355" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_355" style="display:none;"></p>

Failure to file for bankruptcy on time can result in fines, restrictions on freedom, imprisonment, and a ban on conducting business or holding management positions for up to ten years.<br><br>Tax liability can be imposed if the company's tax obligations cannot be fulfilled and the board member fails to prove timely bankruptcy filing or lack of fault. This liability covers tax arrears during their tenure, extend to social security contributions and can be avoided by indicating company assets sufficient to cover the tax debts.<br><br>The extensive liability aims to protect creditors, shareholders, and the company's interests.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_356" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_356" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_356" style="display:none;"></p>

The final version, released on June 17, 2024, introduces significant changes effective from January 1, 2025. Key modifications include revised definitions of "building" and "structure" specifically for property tax purposes, aiming to resolve interpretative disputes between taxpayers and tax authorities. These definitions will be independent from construction law to ensure fiscal stability and reflect judicial precedents.<br><br>The law also standardizes the taxation of multi-space garages in residential buildings, ensuring owners of designated parking spaces pay the same lower tax rate as those with spaces in shared property garages. This equalizes tax burdens by classifying separated multi-space garages as part of the residential building.<br><br>Furthermore, changes are made to tax exemptions for railway infrastructure, cargo terminals, and land, buildings, and structures at public airports, reverting to previous regulations that limit property tax exemptions to areas directly occupied by buildings and structures. Research institutes will only receive tax exemptions for properties used for research activities.<br><br>The bill is scheduled for parliamentary review in Q3 2024.

They found that many companies violated consumer rights and potentially committed offenses.

If solely for business, the taxpayer is exempt from taxes on hidden profits or non-business expenses under Estoński CIT. However, if cars are used for mixed purposes (business and private), private use by a shareholder constitutes a hidden profit. For private use by an employee, it's recognized as a non-business expense.<br><br>When opting for Estoński CIT, leased car taxation requires a specific calculation of the taxable base. Under this regime, the taxable base considers gross expenses documented on invoices for car usage. For mixed-use leased cars, the taxable base for Estoński CIT includes 50% of depreciation allowances on the initial value of leased cars, 50% of VAT attributable to the capital part of the lease payment (if deductible under VAT law), and 50% of the gross amount of the interest portion of the lease payment, including associated VAT. Tax authorities emphasize that any expense impacting net financial result, as per accounting regulations, is subject to classification as hidden profit or non-business expense. Consequently, gross expenses form the taxable base for hidden profits or non-business expenditures under Estoński CIT.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_361" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_361" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_361" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_362" style="display:none;">Currently, the most popular forms of business activity are limited liability companies and registered sole proprietorships. Both can be run by a single person. However, a limited liability company offers significant advantages, particularly in terms of financial responsibility. While its establishment and operation require financial and substantive investment, it limits liability to the registered capital. In contrast, a sole proprietorship exposes the owner to unlimited personal liability for business debts.<br><br>Establishing a sole proprietorship is significantly simpler and faster than a limited liability company, which requires a minimum capital of PLN 5,000 and potentially notarial acts.<br><br>Regarding ZUS (Social Insurance Institution) and taxes, sole proprietorships are burdened with high ZUS contributions, although new entrepreneurs can benefit from reduced rates and reliefs for the first 6 and subsequent 24 months. Tax options include linear tax (19%), progressive tax scale (12% or 32%), or lump-sum tax on registered revenue.<br><br>A single-member limited liability company also incurs ZUS contributions, treating the sole shareholder as a self-employed individual. However, with two or more shareholders, social insurance contributions are generally not applicable to shareholders, leading to significant savings. The company is subject to CIT tax at 19% (or 9% for small taxpayers), with dividends taxed at 19% personal income tax. Tax optimization is possible through employment within the company (e.g., employment contracts, board remuneration) and utilizing tax reliefs like R&D relief or IP Box.<br><br>Limited liability companies also offer greater credibility and ease of capital acquisition through the issuance of new shares, facilitating business partnerships and attracting investment. This transparency and formal structure enhance trust with potential clients.<br><br>In summary, while sole proprietorships are easier and cheaper to set up, limited liability companies offer enhanced security and potential tax benefits, albeit with more demanding requirements. Consulting with a tax and legal advisor is recommended to determine the most suitable legal form for a specific business.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_362" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_362" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_362" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_363" style="display:none;">The Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) has announced a new relief for entrepreneurs called "contribution holidays." Starting November 1, 2024, eligible business owners can apply to be exempt from paying their social insurance contributions for one chosen month per year. This voluntary option is available to sole proprietors and businesses employing up to nine staff members.<br><br>To qualify, entrepreneurs must meet specific criteria, including having no more than ten insured individuals (including themselves) in the month preceding the application, and not having generated excessive income in the past two years, generally not exceeding the equivalent of 2 million euros annually. They also cannot have conducted business for a former employer in a way that relates to their current business activities. The exemption covers mandatory social insurance contributions (retirement, disability, accident), voluntary sickness insurance, and contributions to the Labor Fund and Solidarity Fund. Importantly, the health insurance contribution still needs to be paid. This relief is considered de minimis aid, meaning its availability is subject to the entrepreneur's de minimis aid limit. The exemption applies only to the entrepreneur's own contributions, not those for employees.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_363" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_363" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_363" style="display:none;"></p>

This adjustment by the Ministry of Digitalization is due to the need for legislative processes and amendments to the electronic delivery act. E-Deliveries are a secure, trusted service for sending, receiving, and storing correspondence online, offering legal certainty equivalent to registered mail with return receipt. Key features include clear sender/recipient identification, confidentiality, data integrity, proof of sending/receipt with timestamps, and swift address verification.<br><br>The obligation applies to both public and private sector entities, including government bodies, social security institutions (ZUS, KRUS), healthcare entities (NFZ), educational institutions, courts, prosecutors, law enforcement, and all registered entrepreneurs (CEIDG, KRS). Certain public trust professions like lawyers, legal advisors, tax advisors, restructuring advisors, patent attorneys, and notaries are also mandated. For public administration and public trust professions, the obligation starts January 1, 2025. For businesses, deadlines vary based on registration dates, with some needing e-Delivery addresses as early as April 1, 2025, and others by October 1, 2026, or July 1, 2025, if changes are made to their registration after June 30, 2025. By October 2029, all public entities, local governments, courts, bailiffs, and prosecutors must conduct official correspondence via e-Deliveries. This system aims to improve efficiency, speed, security, and cost-effectiveness in document exchange.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_364" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_364" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_364" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_366" style="display:none;">The Estonian CIT taxation, implemented through the CIT act, covers a four-year tax period declared by the taxpayer in form ZAW-RD. However, changes in a company's legal form requiring the closure of accounting books introduce additional regulations that can affect the duration of the taxation period. The article discusses interpretations and the position of the Director of the National Fiscal Information (DKIS), as well as further legal actions taken by a company in response to this situation.<br><br>According to CIT law, the lump-sum taxation covers a four-year period immediately following the date specified by the taxpayer in form ZAW-RD. If separate regulations mandate the closure of accounting books before the taxpayer's chosen tax year ends, the tax year is considered to run from the first day of the month following the end of the previous tax year to the day the books are closed. In this case, the next tax year runs from the day the books are opened to the end of the taxpayer's chosen year.<br><br>Accounting books must be closed on the day preceding a change in legal form. The DKIS stated that the lump-sum taxation period declared in ZAW-RD is a minimum period. While it can be extended, for instance, by changing the fiscal year during the lump-sum taxation period, it cannot be shortened. A company challenged this interpretation, arguing that closing accounting books due to transformation would create two tax years in 2023, shortening the four-year period. The company's complaint to the Provincial Administrative Court (WSA) was unsuccessful, and the case is awaiting review by the Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) after an appeal.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_366" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_366" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_366" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_367" style="display:none;">On July 23, 2024, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled on the reporting of tax schemes (MDR), finding the regulations unconstitutional insofar as they obligate tax advisors to disclose information covered by professional secrecy to the tax authorities. The National Council of Tax Advisors challenged the MDR regulations in 2019, arguing they violated tax advisor confidentiality, following their implementation into Polish law based on the DAC 6 EU directive.<br><br>The Tribunal, after nearly five years, upheld the complaint, stating that the retroactive application of reporting requirements for domestic tax schemes was unconstitutional and violated the principle of *lex retro non agit*. It questioned provisions requiring tax advisors bound by professional secrecy to provide information about tax schemes without sufficient criteria for exemption and deemed the obligation for tax advisor promoters to report non-cross-border schemes also unconstitutional.<br><br>The Tribunal reasoned that the regulations lacked legal clarity under Article 2 of the Constitution and hindered tax advisors from acting within the public interest under Article 17. It emphasized that any modification of professional secrecy must meet high legislative standards and proportionality regarding constitutional rights. The Tribunal indicated that, following the ruling, the state could only obtain information on tax schemes prepared by tax advisors via the beneficiaries who are obliged to report. While the Tribunal discontinued proceedings in other areas of the complaint, the MDR reporting regulations are not entirely eliminated from Polish law and taxpayers remain subject to the reporting requirements.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_367" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_367" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_367" style="display:none;"></p>

The Polish tax authority stated that since the company lacks a permanent establishment in Poland, it should use its foreign VAT ID, even if registered for VAT in Poland. Using a Polish VAT ID could mislead the service provider about the place of supply. The authority confirmed that the company can deduct VAT from invoices with its Swiss VAT ID for services taxed in Poland. Correcting such invoices with a credit note is unnecessary, as the invoices are correct. The tax authority emphasized that if a foreign entity has a permanent establishment in Poland that participates in a transaction, it must use a Polish VAT ID. However, in this case, the Swiss company does not have a fixed establishment.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_371" style="display:none;">This material comprehensively discusses seven key risks associated with Estonian CIT, a crucial resource for businesses considering this taxation system.<br><br>The risks include: **Hidden Profits:** Defined as benefits to shareholders related to profit participation, encompassing loans, donations, representation expenses, and transaction market value excesses. Exceptions apply, such as salaries below a certain threshold. **Transfer Pricing:** Transfer pricing regulations still apply; companies must prepare relevant documentation. **Significant Limitations:** The flat-rate taxation lasts for four years, extendable if certain employment or expense conditions are met. Companies cannot acquire shares in other companies or use tax reliefs like R&D or IP Box. **Loss of Eligibility:** Losing eligibility occurs at the end of the four-year period or due to non-compliance with passive income, employment, legal form, or ownership structure requirements. Re-election is possible after three years. **Exclusion from Reliefs:** Estonian CIT excludes the use of reliefs such as bad debt relief, R&D relief, IP Box, innovative employee relief, and others. **Limitation on Loss Deduction:** Companies lose the right to deduct past losses, although deductions are possible in the two years preceding the first flat-rate year, provided the system is used for at least four years. **Election During the Tax Year:** Choosing the flat rate is possible mid-year by filing a ZAW-RD notification before the financial statement preparation.<br><br>The "7 Risks Associated with Estonian CIT" guide is offered for download, and further inquiries are welcomed.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_371" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_371" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_371" style="display:none;"></p>

When acting as a data controller, promoters and assistants must provide detailed information including their identity, contact details, the purpose and legal basis for processing data, recipients of the data, storage period, rights to access, rectify, or delete data, the right to complain to a supervisory authority, and whether providing data is a statutory or contractual requirement.<br><br>The law defines "data breach" broadly, encompassing any security breach resulting from intentional, unlawful actions, negligence, or accidents, leading to data destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized access, disclosure, or use, especially concerning personal data. Entities must regularly review and update internal procedures to comply with the new regulations, particularly regarding MDR reporting and personal data protection. Non-compliance can result in penalties up to 2,000,000 PLN, or up to 10,000,000 PLN for unreported obligations, and potential RODO fines of up to 20 million EUR or 4% of annual global turnover. The act aims to combat tax fraud by standardizing financial reporting for digital operators in the EU and updates existing MDR procedures.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_372" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_372" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_372" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_373" style="display:none;">The taxation of advance payments on profit for general partners in limited joint-stock partnerships (SKA) is interpreted differently by tax authorities and administrative courts. It is crucial to understand the positions of both to avoid tax errors.<br><br>Article 41(4e) of the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Act mandates SKAs to collect a flat-rate income tax (19%) on dividends and other income from profit participation, as per Article 30a(1)(4), considering the rules in Article 30a(6a-6e). Article 30a(6a) allows this tax to be reduced by an amount calculated as the product of the general partner's percentage share in the profit and the tax due from the SKA's income.<br><br>Tax interpretations vary. A KIS interpretation from July 23, 2021, states that advance payments to general partners are taxable at 19% upon payment, requiring the company to collect the tax. However, a June 7, 2021, interpretation suggests the company doesn't need to collect the tax at the time of payment; instead, the tax should be calculated after the SKA's tax for the fiscal year is determined, according to Article 30a(6a).<br><br>The Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) echoed the latter view, stating that calculating the general partner's income tax requires knowing the SKA's tax due for the year, making the tax obligation arise only after the company files its CIT return. Taxpayers who opt to withhold tax on advance payments can apply for a refund based on overpayment. If the NSA's view is adopted, the SKA would withhold tax only after calculating its income following the CIT return. The withheld tax is due by the 20th of the following month and reported in PIT-8AR. If no tax is withheld, the general partner reports it in their annual PIT return for the year the SKA filed its CIT return.<br><br>Navigating this complex issue requires careful consideration and consultation with a tax advisor.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_373" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_373" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_373" style="display:none;"></p>

Moore Polska Tax & Legal offers support by sharing knowledge and preparing essential documents and analyses to ensure tax function safety. Transfer pricing refers to the financial outcomes of conditions set between related entities, designed to prevent tax base erosion and profit shifting.<br><br>Entities are considered related if they have capital or personal ties, or if they are located in tax havens or their foreign establishments are in such jurisdictions. While adhering to the Arm's Length Principle is crucial, most taxpayers also face documentation obligations. Thresholds for mandatory documentation include PLN 10 million for goods and financial transactions, and PLN 2 million for services and other transaction types. These thresholds apply to transactions with related parties and entities influenced by the taxpayer's connections.<br><br>While exemptions and simplified documentation options exist, they require thorough analysis due to numerous exclusions and conditions. For example, domestic entities might be exempt if they meet specific criteria, but each related party must comply, and the TPR-C form still needs submission. Certain transaction types, like pure resale with no added value and immediate settlement, can also be exempt, provided they aren't linked to other controlled transactions and involve entities not in tax havens. However, proving the absence of a link to other controlled transactions is often challenging.<br><br>Moore Polska Tax & Legal assists clients with various transfer pricing matters, including transaction verification, local file preparation, TPR-C/TPR-P information, Master File documentation, tax haven transaction support, market price analyses, transfer pricing policy reviews, and training.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_374" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_374" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_374" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_375" style="display:none;">The proposed legislation aims to implement the EU Directive 2022/2555 concerning measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, known as NIS 2. This update is driven by the rapid advancement of technology, the increasing number of online public services, and emerging cyber threats. Both public institutions and private entities are facing escalating cybersecurity challenges, requiring greater resource allocation for protection. The current international situation and the need to serve a wider customer base also necessitate strengthening the national cybersecurity system. Statistics show a significant rise in reported cybersecurity incidents, with over 39,000 in 2022 and over 75,000 in 2023.<br><br>The NIS 2 directive and its implementation necessitate modifications to the existing Act on the National Cybersecurity System (KSC). Key changes include replacing "postal service operators" and "digital service operators" with "essential entities" and "important entities," who will be the primary recipients of legal obligations. The updated KSC will expand the scope of covered entities to include new economic sectors. It will impose risk management obligations on essential and important entities, establish a system for reporting incidents to CSIRT teams, and create sectoral CSIRT teams to assist entities. Furthermore, supervisory authorities' powers will be enhanced, and new administrative fines will be introduced for non-compliance, with proposed minimums of PLN 20,000 for essential entities and PLN 15,000 for important entities. A national plan for responding to large-scale cybersecurity incidents and crises will be developed, and the minister responsible for digitalization will gain expanded competencies, including identifying high-risk suppliers and issuing security orders.<br><br>This bill supports the objectives of the Polish Cybersecurity Strategy 2019–2024, focusing on enhancing resilience to cyber threats and protecting information across public, military, and private sectors. It also contributes to the development of the national cybersecurity system and secures supply chains, fulfilling a milestone in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_375" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_375" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_375" style="display:none;"></p>

The report identifies 13,776 companies founded in 1989 still operating in Poland. These businesses have contributed to Poland's economic growth through innovation and technology adoption, proving more agile and faster in decision-making than larger corporations. Most are SMEs, often family-run, facilitating quicker decisions, but also presenting succession and risk management challenges. Succession planning is crucial for family businesses, balancing tradition with modern approaches, and can drive growth when implemented strategically. Increasingly, women are taking leadership roles, bringing fresh perspectives and fostering diverse teams. These established businesses face challenges like rising energy costs, inflation, and regulatory changes, but their experience prepares them for the future.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_383" style="display:none;">For many new entrepreneurs, office rental costs can be a significant financial burden. A virtual office not only eliminates this problem but also provides a professional company image and helps meet legal requirements for a mailing address and business registration.<br><br>A virtual office is a service that allows registration of a business at a virtual address, without the need for a physical office. This service also includes receiving and managing correspondence, which is convenient for entrepreneurs working remotely or from various locations.<br><br>Polish law requires every entrepreneur to indicate an address where they will conduct business. A virtual office enables this requirement to be met, offering legal title to the address through a lease agreement. Lack of legal title can lead to problems with VAT registration and potential deletion from the Central Registration and Information on Business (CEIDG).<br><br>Signing a virtual office lease agreement before registering a business allows for better planning and organization of the initial phase of running the company. This ensures a smooth transition from the registration process to the actual commencement of operations, minimizing stress related to formalities and allowing for a focus on business development.<br><br>In summary, a virtual office offers not only cost savings and flexibility but also a solid foundation for building a professional company image.<br><br>Virtual offices offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for entrepreneurs. They eliminate the burden of physical office rental while providing a professional business address for registration and correspondence. Crucially, a virtual office ensures compliance with legal requirements, as Polish law mandates a registered business address. Securing a virtual office lease before registering a business streamlines the initial setup, preventing potential issues with VAT registration and business listing. By handling mail and offering a credible address, virtual offices allow entrepreneurs to focus on core business activities rather than administrative tasks. Therefore, a virtual office provides cost-efficiency, legal compliance, and a professional image, all vital for success in today's competitive business environment.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_383" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_383" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_383" style="display:none;"></p>

The legality of e-offices is supported by the Law on Freedom of Economic Activity, granting businesses the freedom to choose their registered office and provide services in their preferred manner. A 2014 Supreme Administrative Court ruling further reinforces this, stating businesses can operate from any location, including e-offices, facilitated by modern technology.<br><br>E-offices provide numerous benefits: safeguarding privacy by using the e-office address instead of a home address on public records, financial flexibility due to the absence of long-term contracts, and administrative assistance. Security measures employed by e-office providers protect client data.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_385" style="display:none;">Cryptocurrency sales in Poland may be exempt from VAT, which is a significant benefit for businesses operating in this rapidly growing industry. However, correctly determining the place of service provision and the tax status of foreign counterparties is crucial to take advantage of the available exemptions.<br><br>According to the VAT Act, the sale of cryptocurrencies is considered a service. Transactions involving currencies, banknotes, and coins used as legal tender are VAT-exempt. Virtual currency units accepted as alternative means of payment fulfill the function of legal tender, thus, cryptocurrency sales fall within this exemption.<br><br>The place of service provision is a key factor. If it's within Poland, the sale is VAT-exempt. However, if the place of service isn't in Poland, specific articles of the VAT Act apply, indicating that services provided to foreign entities are not subject to VAT in Poland. It's essential to determine if the foreign client meets the definition of a taxpayer, meaning they independently conduct economic activity, even under other countries' legal systems.<br><br>In practice, Polish cryptocurrency sales are VAT-exempt, provided the place of service is correctly determined and the foreign counterparty's tax status is verified. Businesses should analyze each transaction carefully to ensure compliance with VAT exemption requirements and consider professional tax advisory services to avoid potential disputes with tax authorities.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_385" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_385" style="display:none;">在波兰，加密货币销售可能免征增值税（VAT），这对从事这一新兴行业的公司而言是一大利好。但要享受此项免税政策，关键在于准确判断服务提供地以及境外交易方的税务身份。<br><br>根据波兰《增值税法》，加密货币销售被视为一种服务。法律规定，涉及法定货币（如纸币和硬币）的交易可免征增值税。由于加密货币被视为一种替代性支付工具，履行了类似法定货币的职能，因此其销售也适用于该免税条款。<br><br>服务提供地是决定是否免税的核心因素。如果服务发生在波兰境内，则销售免征增值税。而如果服务地在波兰境外，根据《增值税法》的特定条款，向境外实体提供的服务则不在波兰的征税范围内。在此情况下，必须确认境外客户是否符合“纳税人”的定义，即无论依据哪国法律，其本身在独立从事经济活动。<br><br>总而言之，只要服务地判定准确，且境外交易方的税务身份得到核实，波兰的加密货币销售通常可以免征增值税。相关企业应仔细评估每笔交易，确保满足免税条件，并考虑寻求专业税务咨询，以避免与税务部门产生潜在纠纷。</p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_385" style="display:none;"></p>

Access requires authorizing an individual with a PESEL number, with two access levels available.<br><br>Key benefits include the ability to consent to electronic correspondence, submit documents to KAS, request tax clearance certificates free of charge, file ZAW-NR notifications, review registration data, and utilize other expanding services.<br><br>A crucial feature is the taxpayer report, providing information on declaration errors, arrears, enforcement actions, and registered business locations and bank accounts, facilitating ongoing tax status monitoring. Experts recommend actively using organizational accounts in the e-Tax Office for more efficient tax management. It streamlines daily tasks and enhances the security and transparency of tax processes.

This measure had temporarily eliminated VAT on a wide range of essential food items, including meat, fish, dairy, eggs, honey, fruits, vegetables, and specific products for infants and medical purposes.<br><br>The decision to revert to the 5% VAT rate is attributed to the country's improving economic situation and decreasing inflation, which had fallen to 3.9%. The return to the standard VAT rate is expected to stabilize the market and the state budget in the long term.<br><br>Consumers may experience price increases on basic food items, impacting household budgets, especially those with lower incomes. While the 5% rate is relatively low, the reintroduction could create short-term market volatility as retailers adjust pricing. The food industry is preparing for the change. Experts emphasize that this step is a move toward normalizing the country's economic and fiscal situation.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_401" style="display:none;">In early January, the Ministry of Development and Technology announced a new "contribution holidays" solution from ZUS (Social Insurance Institution) for the smallest entrepreneurs. This initiative aims to allow eligible businesses to be exempt from social insurance, Labor Fund, and Solidarity Fund contributions for one calendar month each year. The exemption, however, will not cover health contributions.<br><br>A draft bill, released on January 23, 2024, outlines the eligibility criteria and timing for this relief. Contributions during the exemption period will be financed by the state budget, based on the insured person's lowest contribution base.<br><br>This ZUS contribution holiday is designed for micro-entrepreneurs: those running non-agricultural businesses, employing fewer than ten employees, and with an annual turnover not exceeding €2 million. Participants will retain their entitlement to sickness insurance and will not need to suspend their business operations to benefit.<br><br>Certain entrepreneurs are excluded. Those who conducted business in the current or previous year, providing services to a former employer where they worked in the year of business commencement or the preceding year, and performing activities within the scope of their current business for that employer, will not be eligible.<br><br>To utilize this benefit, eligible entrepreneurs must submit an electronic application to ZUS, ideally via a dedicated information profile. Applications can be submitted in the calendar month preceding the desired exemption month. ZUS has 40 days to process the request and must notify the entrepreneur electronically. Even with the exemption, businesses must still file settlement declarations and monthly individual reports for the covered period.<br><br>The new regulations are slated to take effect on October 1 of the current year, though the draft is currently undergoing public consultation. It is expected that further information will be released regarding the finalization of this date and the project's form.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_401" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_401" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_401" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_403" style="display:none;">On January 30, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that an employee who used their employer's identification data to issue false invoices for fraud purposes may be liable to pay the VAT shown on these invoices.<br><br>The case involved a VAT-registered company whose employee, without its knowledge, issued invoices that did not reflect actual economic transactions. During an audit, unlawful VAT deductions based on these false invoices were discovered. Tax authorities sought payment of the VAT from the company, a stance initially supported by a regional administrative court. However, the Supreme Administrative Court, having doubts, referred the matter to the CJEU, questioning whether the taxpayer or the employee should be liable for the VAT on false invoices and if the company had failed in its duty of care towards its employee.<br><br>The CJEU clarified that if an employee issues a false invoice using the employer's identity without their knowledge or consent, the employee is considered the one showing VAT, unless the employer failed to exercise reasonable diligence in supervising the employee's actions. If the employer was aware of the fraud and did not intervene, they could be held liable. However, if the employee's criminal actions were unrelated to their job role, or if there were no prior indications of irregularities, the employer might not be held responsible for the VAT on the forged invoices. Businesses should implement robust security measures and transparent internal procedures to demonstrate due diligence.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_403" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_403" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_403" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_404" style="display:none;">The balance sheet valuation of finished goods, according to the Polish Accounting Act and IAS 2 (International Accounting Standard 2), refers to determining the value of these products on the balance sheet date within a company's accounting records. Finished goods are defined as tangible assets produced or processed by an entity, intended for sale in the ordinary course of business, meaning they have completed all production phases.<br><br>Both Polish law and IAS 2 mandate that these assets are valued at the lower of their acquisition cost or production cost, or their net realizable value (NRV). NRV represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. This principle is rooted in the prudence concept, requiring companies to account for potential decreases in asset value.<br><br>IAS 2 provides detailed guidelines for inventory valuation to ensure comparability of financial statements. It allows for two primary valuation methods: cost and net realizable value. When market value falls below cost, NRV becomes crucial for accurately reflecting economic value. Companies must adjust their accounting records to reflect such decreases, either individually or by grouping similar inventory items. Proper year-end valuation is essential for accurate financial reporting, especially for entities with significant inventory levels, ensuring transparency for auditors and investors, and aiding management. Companies should consult accounting professionals to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and standards, as local requirements may add further stipulations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_404" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_404" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_404" style="display:none;"></p>

ESG serves as a three-faceted evaluation model assessing a company's environmental protection efforts, social welfare contributions, and internal corporate governance standards.<br><br>The significance of ESG in contemporary business is profound. It is no longer a mere concept but an integral part of business strategies, leading to enhanced brand image, increased customer trust, and greater investor confidence.

Furthermore, effective ESG management yields tangible financial benefits, including reduced operational costs, minimized risks, and boosted innovation, contributing to long-term company growth.<br><br>Successful ESG implementation requires a cohesive strategy and the commitment of all employees, reflecting a fundamental business mindset. Key steps include developing a clear ESG policy with defined goals and metrics, integrating ESG into the overall business strategy, consistently monitoring progress, and publishing transparent reports. Employee education on ESG principles is also crucial for enhancing awareness and engagement. Building ESG awareness among employees and customers through training and engaging initiatives strengthens brand loyalty and trust.<br><br>Ultimately, ESG is not just a trend but a critical component of a sustainable business strategy, fostering better financial performance and lasting stakeholder relationships.

An issuer relief allows for deducting advisory and legal costs related to share issuance, capped at 50% of costs or PLN 50,000. For individual investors, purchasing shares during an IPO and holding them for at least three years exempts them from capital gains tax on sale profits.<br><br>The **Expansion relief** permits a double deduction of expenses incurred to expand sales markets. To qualify, businesses must meet specific revenue targets within two consecutive tax years, such as introducing new products or increasing sales in foreign markets.<br><br>Relief for supporting **sport, culture, and education** allows non-agricultural businesses to deduct 50% of expenses incurred on these activities, up to the level of income generated from their business operations, provided these costs haven't been reimbursed or previously deducted.<br><br>The **Robotization relief** allows an additional 50% deduction of expenses on robotization, effectively allowing 150% cost recognition (100% as an expense and 50% as a relief). Eligible costs include acquiring new industrial robots and related peripheral equipment.<br><br>The **Consolidation relief** is for Polish companies acquiring other entities, allowing an additional deduction for expenses directly related to acquiring shares in a capital company.<br><br>The **Prototype relief** permits an additional 30% deduction of expenses related to trial production and market introduction of new products, and can be combined with other reliefs.<br><br>The **Innovative Employees relief** targets businesses incurring losses or low profits, allowing them to deduct qualifying R&D expenses from advance tax payments on employee salaries.<br><br>The **Payment Terminal relief** is for businesses acquiring payment terminals. It offers a deduction of up to PLN 2,500 for entities exempt from sales registration for specific individuals and farmers, and PLN 1,000 for others, covering terminal acquisition and transaction service costs.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_408" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_408" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_408" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_410" style="display:none;">Misunderstanding and ineffective financial management can lead to serious problems for businesses. This article outlines seven common financial "sins" of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and provides actionable advice on how to avoid them.<br><br>The first sin is the **lack of clearly defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and regular verification**. Many entrepreneurs fail to establish financial metrics and budgets, leading to disorientation and loss of control. Regularly monitoring revenue, margins, results, inventory value, and working capital, along with budgeting, is crucial for better control and alignment with financial goals.<br><br>The second is **insufficient working capital management**. Neglecting receivables and inventory can cause payment bottlenecks and freeze capital. Implementing debt collection processes and systematically managing inventory turnover and customer payment terms are vital for financial liquidity.<br><br>The third sin is **ineffective management of purchases and liabilities**. Poor negotiation with suppliers, lack of multiple offers, and inefficient control over financial obligations result in excessive costs and payment difficulties. Negotiating better payment terms and exploring various offers can improve the company's financial standing.<br><br>The fourth is the **absence of periodic cash flow analysis**. Many entrepreneurs overlook cash flow, leading to a lack of control over available funds. Regular cash flow analysis allows for informed management, quick reaction to liquidity issues, and accurate financial planning by estimating inflows and outflows.<br><br>The fifth is **lacking a financial cushion**. Without a financial reserve, companies are vulnerable to sudden expenses or revenue drops. Securing financing like an overdraft or leasing, even during prosperous times, acts as an insurance policy against future financial difficulties.<br><br>The sixth sin is **mismatched financing to business needs**. Incorrectly understanding financing types can lead to over-indebtedness or misallocation of funds. Aligning funding sources with specific company needs, such as using long-term debt for fixed assets, is essential for optimizing financial structure.<br><br>Finally, the seventh sin is **managing based on tax minimization**. Focusing solely on reducing taxes like VAT, CIT, and PIT, rather than creating enterprise value, leads to short-sighted financial management and can ultimately diminish the company's valuation. A long-term perspective, considering tax implications, and consulting with financial and tax advisors are recommended.<br><br>Avoiding these financial pitfalls requires awareness, planning, the use of appropriate financial tools, and expert consultation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_410" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_410" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_410" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_411" style="display:none;">The Polish Ministry of Finance has announced a delay in the mandatory implementation of the National e-Invoicing System (KSeF). Initially slated for July 1, 2024, for all businesses and January 1, 2025, for VAT-exempt small and medium-sized enterprises, the new deadline will be announced after an audit of the system’s development. The Ministry acknowledged critical errors in KSeF’s IT infrastructure and code, which could have impacted its performance. To address these issues, a technological audit has been commissioned. Furthermore, the Ministry plans to hold consultations with entrepreneurs to ensure the system's successful implementation with their input. Despite the postponement, the Ministry emphasizes that KSeF will eventually become mandatory, and development work will continue. Businesses that have not yet prepared for KSeF can now take a brief respite but must remain ready for future integration and compliance with the new requirements. The delay provides companies an opportunity to prepare for the system’s eventual rollout, ensuring smooth operations and reliable invoice processing.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_411" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_411" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_411" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_412" style="display:none;">Intercompany transactions are crucial in today's business environment, and fulfilling transfer pricing obligations is becoming increasingly common for taxpayers, especially given the dynamic legal landscape. Understanding the processes and practices of transfer pricing documentation (TPR) is key to efficient time management. This article provides guidance on TPR submission for current and previous tax years, including the concept of active repentance.<br><br>For tax years prior to 2022, TPR forms (versions 3 and 4) were interactive PDFs that lacked the mandatory statement on preparing transfer pricing documentation. Thus, a separate statement had to be submitted electronically to the relevant tax office, signed by the entity's head (as defined by accounting law) or by all authorized representatives if multiple individuals met the criteria or the head was unclear. Submission by proxy was not permitted for this statement. The TPR-C form (versions 3 and 4) was submitted electronically to the Head of the National Revenue Administration (KAS) and could be signed and filed by a proxy. The submission process for these older versions involved downloading a 32-bit Adobe Reader, opening the form, and using the "sign and send" function.<br><br>For the 2022 tax year onwards, the TPR-C form (version 5) is in XML format and includes the statement on preparing documentation. The submission authority has also changed from KAS to the local tax office. This version must be signed by the entity's head or a designated member of a multi-person governing body, with exceptions for proxies who are legal or tax professionals. The submission process involves filling or importing an XML file via a designated website, accepting and sending it, signing with tax data or a qualified signature, and uploading the signed document in XML or XAdES format.<br><br>Taxpayers can use active repentance if they fail to submit the TPR Information on time. This involves notifying the appropriate tax office about the violation, which can be done electronically with a qualified electronic signature, trusted profile, or personal signature, or in paper form.<br><br>In essence, submitting TPR and utilizing active repentance are largely electronic processes, simplifying tax compliance. However, taxpayers must be aware of the specific forms and rules applicable to each tax year to avoid transfer pricing issues.<br><br>Moore Polska's specialists are available for consultations on transfer pricing, active repentance, tax, and legal matters.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_412" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_412" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_412" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_413" style="display:none;">In today's global economy, international goods transport is crucial for many businesses. However, disruptions or delays in transport can impact VAT taxation. This article examines the issue of VAT on transport delays, analyzing different viewpoints and associated risks.<br><br>**Taxation of Delays:** If a transport delay stems from a carriage contract with loading and unloading clauses, the demurrage fee increases the VAT taxable base. Such additional fees are considered part of the international transport service and are taxed at the rate applicable to that service, as confirmed by tax authorities and courts.<br><br>**Compensation vs. Fee:** If demurrage costs are considered compensation and not a service provision, they are not subject to VAT. In such cases, a debit note is the appropriate document, not affecting VAT liability.<br><br>**Risks and Case Law:** Tax authorities and administrative courts have varying stances on transport delays. For goods export, proof of departure from Poland and maintained product characteristics is required. Transport interruptions or warehousing can lead to the loss of preferential VAT rates.<br><br>**Conclusion:** If a business transports goods by sea to a non-EU contractor and stops at an EU port for additional loading, export can be demonstrated if the original goods remain unchanged and were not unloaded, with the stop solely for adding other cargo. However, due to differing official opinions, meticulous documentation of the transaction is necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences. Businesses must be aware of the tax risks associated with transport delays and thoroughly analyze transport processes to ensure correct VAT accounting.<br><br>For further questions on transport taxation, contact our specialists.<br><br>Analysis, Transport Delay, Risks, Transport, VAT<br><br>Contact us: agnieszka.drozdz-wilk@moorepolska.pl</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_413" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_413" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_413" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_414" style="display:none;">To improve a company's financial situation, debt, such as loans or supplier obligations, can be converted into equity. This is common when a company owes money to related entities, particularly a parent company, and cannot afford to repay. This conversion acts as support for the struggling subsidiary. Less frequently, debt is converted when the creditor is not a shareholder. In this scenario, the creditor becomes a shareholder in exchange for extinguishing the debt, anticipating future profits. This shifts the company's financing from debt to equity, improving financial indicators and reducing leverage.<br><br>Two primary methods exist for converting debt into share capital for an LLC: either as a non-cash contribution (in-kind) where the debt is transferred to the company via assignment, leading to its extinction through confusion, or by increasing capital with a cash contribution followed by a set-off of mutual receivables. Accounting involves reclassifying the debt from loan accounts to shareholder contribution accounts, which are then settled against the increased share capital. Direct conversion of debt into reserve capital is not possible; it requires a share capital increase, with any excess debt value over the share value contributing to the reserve capital as share premium.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_414" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_414" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_414" style="display:none;"></p>

The opening remanent does not affect the health contribution, but the difference between the opening and closing remanent, known as the "remanent difference," does.<br><br>**Impact of Remanent Difference on Health Contribution**<br><br>The remanent difference can either increase or decrease income. If the closing remanent value is higher than the opening remanent value, income increases by this difference, thereby increasing the basis for the health contribution. Conversely, if the opening remanent value is greater than the closing remanent value, income decreases by the remanent difference, leading to a reduction in the health contribution basis.<br><br>**Health Contribution for 2023**<br><br>Changes introduced by the "Polish Deal" legislation from 2022 onwards meant that remanent differences impacted health contribution calculations. Previously, only negative remanent differences influenced the health contribution. However, this legal framework changed at the end of 2022. From 2023, both positive and negative remanent differences are considered when calculating the health contribution basis. Therefore, the annual health contribution settlement for 2023, filed on the ZUS DRA form for April 2024, will incorporate these remanent differences regardless of whether they are positive or negative.<br><br>For further questions regarding inventory valuation or health contributions, please contact our experts.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_415" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_415" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_415" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_416" style="display:none;">Transformations in the Polish Audit Market<br><br>In 2023, the number of audit firms auditing the financial statements of listed companies in Poland significantly decreased to 37, down from 46 in the previous year and 48 in 2021. This decline is attributed to market consolidation driven by legislative changes and increased regulatory demands concerning both personnel and technology. Many smaller audit firms withdrew, creating opportunities for new and mid-sized players.<br><br>Moore Polska emerged as a leader among auditing firms for listed companies, auditing 17 financial statements of GPW-listed companies in 2023. This achievement, coupled with its rise to 9th place in the "Rzeczpospolita" ranking of auditors, highlights the firm's advancement, professionalism, and process optimization in the audit sector.<br><br>The traditional "Big Four" auditors (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC) have seen a slight decrease in their dominance as they increasingly shift their services to areas other than auditing listed companies. This has opened doors for mid-sized firms like Moore Polska and Grant Thornton to become leaders in auditing financial statements of public companies.<br><br>"The supervision system for auditors of public interest entities has significantly tightened over the last four years, with the Polish Audit Oversight Authority actively inspecting and overseeing firms auditing listed companies," commented Piotr Witek, Managing Partner at Moore Polska. He added that regulatory, staffing, organizational, and technological requirements have substantially increased, leading to a situation where the "Big 4" no longer dominate due to their focus on more profitable services for listed companies, which often excludes them from auditing financial statements.<br><br>Moore Polska's leadership position is a result of its adaptability to changing market conditions, adherence to evolving regulatory requirements, and commitment to service quality, as well as client trust earned through professionalism and reliability. The firm's success is a testament to its ability to build lasting, empathetic client relationships, demonstrating that mid-sized, Polish-capitalized firms can thrive in the dynamic Polish audit market.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_416" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_416" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_416" style="display:none;"></p>

This obligation does not extend to the partners or a designated partner of the civil law partnership.<br><br>The Corporate Income Tax Act (ustawa o CIT) requires related entities to prepare local transfer pricing documentation electronically by the end of the tenth month after the tax year ends, to demonstrate that transfer prices were set at arm's length. The Act defines an "entity" broadly, including individuals, legal entities, organizational units without legal personality, and foreign establishments. However, the interpretation clarifies that a civil law partnership does not fit the definition of an "organizational unit without legal personality" as contemplated by the Act for transfer pricing purposes. The tax authority reasoned that the partners, not the civil law partnership itself, are the parties to such transactions, and the partnership lacks separate legal personality under the Corporate Income Tax Act. Therefore, a civil law partnership is not considered an "entity" for transfer pricing documentation requirements when dealing with its partners.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_423" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_423" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_423" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_425" style="display:none;">Accrued expenses for unused holidays are distinct from provisions under accounting law. Accrued expenses relate to costs that will definitely occur, whereas provisions cover uncertain liabilities in terms of amount or due date. Consequently, their accounting treatment should be separate.<br><br>The text clarifies that this pertains to compensation for holiday time not paid due to unused leave, not the equivalent for unused vacation days themselves. When employment continues into a new year, unused leave from the previous year must be granted by September 30th of the following year. Holiday leave is typically taken in kind, necessitating the payment of holiday wages. This means employers must grant and pay for both earned and overdue leave, including holiday pay for the latter. Therefore, payments for unused holidays are certain and arise from fulfilling legal obligations.<br><br>Accrued expenses for unused holiday pay are recognized to allocate costs to the period the employee worked, not when they were on leave. This aligns with accounting standards like IAS 19, which mandate recognizing expected benefits from employee work as liabilities and expenses. Specifically, for cumulative paid absences like holiday leave, the cost should be recognized when the employee performs work that increases their entitlement. This ensures that the cost of unused holidays is matched with the period of work performed, reflecting the company's financial performance more accurately, rather than the period of absence. This approach impacts financial reporting by smoothing out salary costs and matching expenses to the periods in which the benefits were earned.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_425" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_425" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_425" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_427" style="display:none;">The independence of an auditor is paramount for reliable financial assessments. As a public trust, auditors play a crucial role in accounting and financial control systems. They must inspire societal confidence that they will always act honestly and impartially, free from any pressure. This integrity ensures fair and trustworthy evaluations of company financial statements and underpins public trust in accounting. Key traits for auditors include objectivity, professionalism, and prioritizing the public interest. They must adhere to ethical codes and continuously enhance their knowledge to provide top-tier services. The profession relies on strong client-auditor trust, professional secrecy, a good public reputation, and due diligence.<br><br>Auditor independence refers to the ability to perform duties objectively, without external influences that could compromise judgment. Auditors must avoid conflicts of interest, remuneration pressures, or any factor affecting their independent opinions, and cannot perform other financial services like bookkeeping for the audited entity. This independence is vital for financial statement credibility, enabling auditors to assess procedures and documentation without fear of management or stakeholder pressure. It is the foundation of trust in financial reports. Independence is categorized into independence of mind (mental objectivity, professional skepticism, and honesty) and independence of appearance (avoiding situations where a reasonable third party would perceive a compromise in integrity, objectivity, or skepticism). Auditors maintain independence through strict adherence to ethical codes and professional standards, employing internal quality control systems to identify, assess, and mitigate threats to independence. Audit firms and team members must declare their compliance with independence requirements under penalty of law.<br><br>In essence, auditor independence is critical for the reliability of financial statement opinions. Auditors must uphold stringent standards and ethical principles to provide independent and credible opinions, which is fundamental for fair financial markets and the economy.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_427" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_427" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_427" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_428" style="display:none;">The term "audit" originates from the Latin "auditor," meaning listener. Historically, audits involved publicly reading and verifying accounts. The institution of auditing developed significantly in the 19th century, initially as an external function. In the 20th century, organizations began employing internal auditors to ensure compliance and check control mechanisms. Today, audits are conducted by independent experts, focusing on improving organizations rather than solely identifying irregularities. An audit is a planned process designed for improvement, not just a control measure.<br><br>When selecting an auditor, consider their experience, industry knowledge, and the expertise of their team, which should include a certified auditor capable of providing an independent opinion. Key criteria for choosing an auditor include specialization in your industry, access to supporting experts (tax, finance, IT, etc.), relevant qualifications and experience, adaptability to your organization's specifics, and high service standards (timeliness, quality, communication). Price should not be the primary factor, as low fees can sometimes indicate lower quality.<br><br>Finding the "ideal" auditor is achievable with the right partner. Moore Polska positions itself as a specialized team understanding unique business needs and offering personalized service. They leverage interdisciplinary and international expertise from the Moore Global network, combined with deep knowledge of the Polish business landscape and regulations.

They emphasize a collaborative approach to support sustainable business development.<br><br>A linguistic note: "Audit" is the English form of "audyt." Despite not conforming to Polish borrowing rules and not being in normative dictionaries, it has become industry jargon due to an unfortunate translation of ISO standards.

It's a broad, multidimensional concept encompassing various aspects of employees' professional and personal lives that affect their mental, emotional, and physical state.<br><br>Key components of corporate wellbeing extend beyond mental and physical health to include opportunities for professional development and maintaining work-life balance. Crucially, it involves fostering a positive organizational culture built on understanding, trust, safety, and empathy. Without this foundation, even material benefits like gym memberships or cinema tickets fail to improve employee engagement.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_431" style="display:none;">In recent months, the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) has been highly active, increasing its scrutiny of businesses in the Polish market. This intensified oversight, particularly since January 1, 2023, stems from significant legislative changes concerning consumer rights, price information, and unfair market practices. Key areas of focus include transparent communication about price reductions, updates on electronic platforms, complaint procedures, and contract termination rights.<br><br>Recent high-profile cases illustrate UOKiK's enforcement actions. Zalando, Sephora, Glovo, and Media Markt faced accusations of misleading consumers regarding price reductions by failing to clearly display the lowest price within the preceding 30 days, a mandatory requirement. Online platforms like Booking, Zalando, and Travelist were also charged with violating consumer collective interests by not properly informing users about whether offers came from businesses or individuals, as mandated by the Omnibus Directive implementation. Additionally, Carrefour Polska and Auchan Polska were investigated for potentially abusing contractual advantages by charging suppliers for transport costs, shifting their own operational expenses.<br><br>To avoid UOKiK sanctions, businesses must adhere to updated regulations, ensuring clear communication on price reductions and the origin of offers on online platforms. They should also avoid practices that could be construed as an unfair use of contractual advantages, such as unfairly burdening suppliers with costs. Adherence to these principles is crucial for maintaining compliance and avoiding penalties, which can amount to a significant percentage of annual turnover.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_431" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_431" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_431" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_432" style="display:none;">Profitability Analysis – Criteria<br><br>The primary goal of any business is profit, making its measurement crucial for both external analysts and internal management. Profitability can be assessed by relating a company's income to its sales volume, asset base, or book/market equity. Key indicators used for this evaluation include: ROE, ROA, Operating Profit Margin, and Net Profit Margin.<br><br>ROE (Return on Equity) measures how much profit a company generates from its shareholders' equity. A higher ROE indicates better financial health and more efficient use of equity capital, leading to potential for greater financial surplus and higher shareholder dividends. It is a key metric for investors and management to gauge profit generation effectiveness from available capital resources and impacts long-term stability and growth.<br><br>ROA (Return on Assets) assesses a company's ability to generate profits and efficiently utilize its assets. It is calculated as net profit divided by total assets, or as the product of sales margin and asset turnover. A higher ROA signifies a stronger financial position, meaning the company earns more profit relative to its assets. This is particularly important for lenders evaluating a company's debt repayment capacity based on asset performance.<br><br>Operating Profit Margin relates operating profit (EBIT) to sales revenue, indicating how much operating profit is generated per unit of sales. A higher margin signifies greater operational efficiency.<br><br>Net Profit Margin (ROS - Return on Sales) measures the percentage of net profit remaining from sales revenue after all costs, including taxes, are deducted. A higher net profit margin indicates a better financial condition, meaning more profit is retained. A declining ROS may necessitate increased sales to achieve the same profit level, highlighting its importance in assessing operational efficiency and profit-generating ability from sales.<br><br>These profitability measures, alongside financial, debt, and turnover analyses, help assess current performance and predict future trends but do not provide definitive actions. When interpreting these indicators, consider the company's characteristics and operating environment. Compare current data with previous financial periods and with competitors to establish relative efficiency.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_432" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_432" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_432" style="display:none;"></p>

Asset turnover can be analyzed through various cross-sections by calculating: Total Asset Turnover, Accounts Receivable Turnover, and Inventory Turnover.<br><br>**Total Asset Turnover** measures how many times a company's sales exceed its assets. This ratio is industry-dependent, being lower in capital-intensive industries and higher where human labor is paramount. It is most useful for intra-industry comparisons. A higher turnover indicates more efficient asset utilization, potentially due to shorter production cycles or higher sales profitability. An increasing value is generally a positive sign of better resource management.<br><br>**Accounts Receivable Turnover** assesses the efficiency of debt collection. An optimal range is typically between 7 and 10. A ratio below 7 suggests overly generous credit terms for customers, while a ratio above 10 may indicate a too-stringent collection policy that could alienize customers.<br><br>**Inventory Turnover** measures how effectively a company manages its inventory of goods or raw materials, indicating how many times inventory is replenished annually. A typical healthy range is between 7 and 10. Values below 7 suggest slow sales and potential excess storage costs or aging inventory. Values above 10 might mean the company cannot meet product demand, leading to order fulfillment issues.<br><br>---<br><br>Improving management efficiency hinges on the effective utilization of assets, which can be assessed through turnover analysis. Three key metrics are Total Asset Turnover, Accounts Receivable Turnover, and Inventory Turnover.<br><br>Total Asset Turnover quantifies how many times sales surpass a company's total assets, varying by industry. Higher turnover signals efficient asset use, often linked to shorter production cycles or robust sales profitability. It's best used for comparing similar companies.<br><br>Accounts Receivable Turnover evaluates debt collection effectiveness. An optimal range is 7-10; below this suggests extended credit terms, while above it indicates a potentially off-puttingly strict collection policy.<br><br>Inventory Turnover measures inventory management efficiency, showing how often stock is replenished. A healthy range is 7-10. Lower values may indicate slow sales and storage issues, whereas higher values could signify an inability to meet customer demand.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_434" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_434" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_434" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_435" style="display:none;">Debt ratios characterize the degree to which an entity is financed by external sources, particularly in relation to the equity capital employed. The most commonly distinguished ratios in this area include: General Debt, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Long-Term Debt Ratio, and Fixed Assets Debt Ratio.<br><br>The General Debt Ratio (debt ratio, DR) expresses the proportion of foreign capital (liabilities) to a company's assets, indicating the overall financing structure and the degree of indebtedness. A value exceeding 0.67 suggests excessive credit risk, while a low ratio signifies greater financial independence. However, the optimal financing structure depends on factors like capital cost and return rates.<br><br>The Debt-to-Equity Ratio assesses the relationship between foreign and equity capital. It is generally accepted that this ratio should not exceed 1.0 for large and medium-sized enterprises and 3.0 for small ones, indicating acceptable debt levels relative to equity based on company size. A lower ratio suggests greater financial autonomy, while a higher one may signal increased financial risk.<br><br>The Long-Term Debt Ratio measures how well long-term liabilities are covered by equity. A value exceeding 1.0 indicates a highly indebted company.<br><br>The Fixed Assets Debt Ratio (solvency ratio) assesses the extent to which long-term liabilities are secured by fixed assets, evaluating a company's ability to repay long-term obligations based on its tangible assets. A higher ratio indicates better security for long-term debt.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_435" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_435" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_435" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_436" style="display:none;">The minimum income tax, also known as the corporate tax, was introduced on January 1, 2022, as part of Poland's "New Deal" reforms, regulated by Article 24ca of the Corporate Income Tax Act (CIT). It applies to taxpayers headquartered or managed in Poland, capital groups, and those operating through a foreign establishment in Poland. The new provision is set to take effect from January 1, 2024, with an exemption until the end of the current tax year for entities whose tax year differs from the calendar year and began before January 1, 2024.<br><br>The minimum CIT rate is 10% of the tax base. It targets corporate income taxpayers who derive no more than 2% of their income from sources other than capital gains, or who incurred a loss from non-capital gain sources. This effectively means the tax applies to entities experiencing a tax loss. Certain income and costs, particularly those related to specific transactions, fixed asset acquisitions, or improvements under regulated pricing, are excluded from loss calculations. Additionally, excise duty, retail sales tax, gaming tax, fuel surcharge, and emission fee are not considered costs.<br><br>Exemptions from the minimum CIT include businesses starting operations in a given year, financial institutions, and companies solely owned by natural persons. Also exempt are entities whose revenue decreased by at least 30% compared to the previous tax year, and businesses whose majority of revenue comes from operating ships or aircraft in international transport.<br><br>The tax base is generally calculated as 1.5% of revenue from non-capital gain sources, plus certain financing costs exceeding the statutory limit. An optional simplified calculation allows for a 3% tax base based on non-capital gain revenue, which must be declared. Taxpayers must file their declarations and pay the tax by the end of the third month following the tax year's end.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_436" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_436" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_436" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_437" style="display:none;">The distinction between current and prospective creditworthiness is essential for adapting financial assessments to diverse practical scenarios. Banks need to ascertain not only a company's credit capacity at the time of a loan application but also its ability to maintain it throughout the loan's duration. This involves evaluating current financial data (current creditworthiness) and projecting future capacity until the repayment deadline (prospective creditworthiness).<br><br>A bank's assessment of current creditworthiness extends beyond loan approval. Loan agreements typically require borrowers to submit periodic business information and grant banks the right to inspect aspects related to loan repayment security. Current creditworthiness assessment is crucial for short-term working capital loans used to cover immediate obligations. This analysis involves monitoring bank account activity but primarily relies on financial statements, particularly the balance sheet and income statement, which provide fundamental financial reporting data. The analysis period can vary, encompassing both annual and multi-year comparisons.<br><br>Key analytical methods include comparative analysis of annual and multi-year data, data structure analysis, ratio analysis, analysis of specific issues, cash flow analysis, financial position analysis, and break-even analysis. Comparative analysis tracks changes in balance sheet and income statement items, both in absolute and relative terms. Data structure analysis assesses the proportion of assets, liabilities, and income statement items relative to total assets and sales value. Ratio analysis, widely used, involves calculating and comparing financial ratios over time and across similar companies.<br><br>In practice, financial analysis using various ratios aims to evaluate a company's financial position, including liquidity, creditworthiness, efficiency, and profitability. This evaluation involves comparing current and projected ratios to historical performance, industry benchmarks, and planned targets. Key ratio categories include liquidity, debt, efficiency, and profitability ratios. Liquidity analysis focuses on a company's ability to meet its financial obligations on time. It includes current ratio (ideally 1.3-2, with 2 considered optimal), quick ratio (ideally 1.0, excluding inventory, or 0.7 for high-turnover businesses), and cash ratio (ideally 0.2, though less critical as cash should be minimized to maximize revenue-generating assets).<br><br>Banks assess creditworthiness using a combination of methods to understand a company's financial health both now and in the future, ensuring the repayment of loans. This involves rigorous analysis of financial statements, key ratios, and comparative data to gauge a company's ability to manage its obligations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_437" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_437" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_437" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_439" style="display:none;">The MDR (Mandatory Disclosure Rules) procedure, also known as the internal procedure for counteracting the failure to report tax schemes, is a mandatory document required by Polish tax law. It obligates entities, particularly legal persons and organizational units without legal personality, to implement this internal procedure. The threshold for this obligation, based on revenue or costs exceeding 8 million PLN in the preceding year, has not been updated by the legislator, meaning smaller businesses that initially fell below this threshold may now be subject to it due to economic growth and professionalization.<br><br>The complexity of Polish law, increased cross-border transactions, and the engagement of external advisors further expand the number of entities needing to comply. Failure to implement the MDR procedure can result in significant fines, up to 2 million PLN for non-compliance and up to 10 million PLN if a tax offense is confirmed by a court.<br><br>A well-prepared MDR procedure serves as a crucial tool for businesses, clarifying tax reporting obligations, defining key terms with practical examples, identifying high-risk areas within the organization, and establishing clear processes for identifying, reporting, and processing reportable tax schemes. This proactive approach reduces the risk of non-compliance, enhances organizational awareness, and improves efficiency. Moreover, possessing an MDR procedure demonstrates a commitment to responsible tax management, aligning with growing expectations for corporate social responsibility and transparency. The increasing volume of MDR reports filed signifies a growing awareness of these obligations among taxpayers. Moore Polska's Tax and Legal Department offers support in developing these internal procedures.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_439" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_439" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_439" style="display:none;"></p>

This revocation, as per a May 2023 regulation, reinstated previously suspended tax obligations, including those concerning MDR reporting.<br><br>The obligation to report tax schemes was suspended until 30 days after the lifting of the epidemic threat. This meant that until the end of July, the deadlines for reporting domestic tax schemes to the Head of the National Revenue Administration were suspended. For the MDR-1 form, which applies to facilitators, promoters, and beneficiaries, the deadline was 30 days from the day after the scheme was made available, the first action related to its implementation, or its preparation, whichever occurred first. This placed the maximum deadline for submitting MDR-1 on August 30, 2023.<br><br>The reporting deadline for MDR-3 is more complex. Unlike MDR-1, its deadline is tied to the filing of tax returns and is not affected by the 30-day suspension period outlined in the Tax Ordinance. Beneficiaries who undertook actions within a tax scheme or received tax benefits from one in 2023 are required to submit MDR-3 with their relevant tax declaration. The Ministry of Finance indicated that MDR-3 reporting for 2020, 2021, and 2022, periods during which reporting was suspended, should be completed by August 1, 2023. This date also marks the start and end of the reporting period for MDR-3 if the original deadline fell in 2021. Despite the suspension of deadlines for non-cross-border schemes, information and notifications regarding these schemes could still be submitted between March 31, 2020, and July 31, 2023, making August 1, 2023, the final deadline for MDR-3.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_440" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_440" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_440" style="display:none;"></p>

However, legislative work is not yet complete, with the ministry only outlining the core solutions. A pre-consultation draft from May detailed a new requirement: an opinion from an independent statutory auditor on the applicant's report containing key data must be submitted with the application, unlike the previous edition where it was required during the settlement phase.<br><br>This shift presents significant challenges. Applicants must now provide a report detailing their assumptions, evidence, and calculations for energy costs, along with the auditor's attestation service report, adhering to specific national and international standards. The tight deadlines are a major concern. The first application period covers up to June 30, 2023, with applications due 45 days later, by August 15th.

This facilitates first-time homeownership but will reduce local government revenue.<br><br>The second change mandates a 6% PCC payment, in addition to VAT, for wholesale purchases of six or more apartments in a single investment, provided the sale is subject to VAT. This means buyers will pay double tax on the sixth and subsequent properties within the same development, unless those properties are part of a larger estate under a single land registry entry. This measure aims to curb speculative property acquisitions. The amendment was signed in July 2023, with the first-home exemption effective 30 days after publication, likely late August. The 6% PCC rate for wholesale purchases will take effect from January 1, 2024.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_443" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_443" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_443" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_444" style="display:none;">The Poland.Business Harbour program offers citizens of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine an accelerated and preferential visa pathway. This unique PBH visa allows IT specialists to apply with their families, work without a prior work permit, and establish businesses under the same conditions as Polish citizens. The program also facilitates interaction with local governments and Special Economic Zones, which provide temporary office and living spaces, business connections with investors, and R&D grants.<br><br>To apply for the simplified visa, applicants need a national visa application, a biometric photo, a passport valid for at least three months beyond the planned return and issued within the last 10 years, and medical insurance covering the visa's validity with a minimum of 30,000 Euros. IT specialists must provide proof of technical education or at least one year of IT experience, along with evidence of interest from a partner company. Startup founders need qualification for the Poland Prize program, and existing business owners require qualification through the Polish Investment and Trade Agency. Visa processing typically takes 2-5 weeks. Upon arrival, PBH visa holders can work and establish businesses in Poland without additional permits, with employment processes mirroring those for Polish citizens. Visa extensions are handled through residence permit applications in Poland, avoiding the need to leave the EU. Applicants are reminded that the program is free, excluding medical insurance costs, and includes a competency interview.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_444" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_444" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_444" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_445" style="display:none;">A taxpayer is entitled to interest for the entire period during which unduly collected tax is held. On June 8, 2023, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled in case C-322/22 that a taxpayer who has paid undue tax is entitled to interest for the entire period the tax authorities held the amount. This ruling primarily concerns situations where the obligation to pay a specific tax has been previously challenged by the CJEU.<br><br>The case stemmed from a U.S. investment fund's request to Polish tax authorities for a refund of taxes on dividends from Polish companies, based on a previous CJEU ruling from June 10, 2014, case C-190/12, which stated that such dividends are exempt from income tax. Despite this ruling, Polish law hasn't been updated to reflect it. The CJEU in C-322/22 found that Article 78 § 5 points 1 and 2 of the Polish Tax Ordinance Act are inconsistent with EU law. These provisions limit interest on tax overpayments resulting from CJEU rulings, granting it only from the date of overpayment to 30 days after the CJEU's judgment publication, or not at all if the refund request is filed after that date.<br><br>The CJEU reasoned that anyone burdened with tax due to a breach of EU law is entitled to a full refund of the tax amount and all applicable interest. The amount of interest should not depend on when the refund request is filed, as taxpayers may not be aware of CJEU rulings at the same time. This ruling is crucial for taxpayers, enabling them to claim refunds and interest for the entire period their tax payments were held, without necessarily waiting for Polish law to be amended.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_445" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_445" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_445" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_447" style="display:none;">Though it seems simple, the saying "He who asks doesn't stray" holds great wisdom, suggesting we can avoid mistakes by learning from others' experience. Asking questions stimulates creativity and is the first step toward finding answers. Asking the right questions is key to communication.<br><br>It's sometimes difficult to ask questions, because it's not just about asking, but asking *good* questions. Many ask questions incorrectly, resulting in poor answers. Before asking, consider what you hope to gain. Be inquisitive and specific to open up dialogue. Google is a great example: the more specific your search terms, the better the results. Asking questions, as Socrates noted, is a way to reach the truth. Don't assume you know best; ask questions to broaden your horizons.<br><br>Before you ask a question, define your goal. What do you hope to achieve? Ensure the question is relevant to the context, situation, and person you're asking. Choose the right person based on their expertise. Be specific in your question to get a clear, comprehensive answer, focusing on the core issue without unnecessary jargon. Listen carefully to the answer, even if it challenges your assumptions. Be open to different perspectives and maintain eye contact, sharing your doubts and asking follow-up questions. Regardless of the other person's attitude, remain calm and respectful. Good manners open doors. Asking the right questions in the right way is a trait of good leaders. Questions are powerful tools for development, stimulating thought and building self-awareness, often leading to valuable, lasting relationships.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_447" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_447" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_447" style="display:none;"></p>

This allows multiple entities to be treated as a single taxpayer, a concept introduced by the implementation of Directive 112. The aim was to standardize regulations across EU member states to prevent market distortions.<br><br>To form a VAT group, members must have economic, financial, and organizational links and be based in the country. Financial ties mean one member holds at least 50% of shares or voting rights in the others. Economic ties exist if their main activities are similar, complementary, or if one member's activities heavily benefit the others. Organizational ties involve common management or coordinated operations.<br><br>Once a VAT group is established, internal transactions become tax-neutral, requiring no invoicing or reporting. Dealings with external entities are treated as transactions of the VAT group. While each member fulfills VAT obligations through the group, a designated representative handles tax settlements. If members previously used a pre-VAT coefficient to determine deductible VAT on mixed-use purchases, the group should continue using the individual members' pre-coefficients from the year the group was formed.<br><br>VAT groups offer benefits such as simplifying tax administration and facilitating effective tax planning by treating the members as a single taxpayer.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_448" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_448" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_448" style="display:none;"></p>

The case arose from a dispute concerning the taxation of silos, with a company arguing they should be classified as buildings based on their characteristics, leading to a lower tax assessment based on usable area rather than initial value (used for "budowla"). The Tribunal agreed that defining tax objects by referencing other laws violates the constitutional principle that tax elements should be defined solely within tax laws. The Tribunal emphasized that taxpayers should be able to determine their tax obligations based solely on tax laws without needing to refer to other legislation. The ruling necessitates a new definition of "budowla" in the Law on Local Taxes and Fees and potential changes to the legal definition of "building", both without referencing non-tax laws, within 18 months.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_451" style="display:none;">Tax Capital Groups (TCG) are gaining popularity among CIT taxpayers due to the simplified conditions for their establishment introduced in 2021. One major advantage is the ability to file a consolidated income tax return. However, TCG status applies solely within the scope of the CIT Act, meaning constituent companies retain tax autonomy under other tax laws.<br><br>To form a TCG, several conditions must be met. Participating companies must be capital-related entities in the form of a joint-stock company, limited liability company, or simple joint-stock company. The minimum share capital for each company has been reduced to PLN 250,000. A dominant company must be designated, responsible for calculating, collecting, and paying CIT, and holding at least 75% of the share capital in subsidiary companies. Furthermore, the companies must not have outstanding tax payments to the state budget.<br><br>A written agreement for at least three tax years is obligatory, filed with the tax office 45 days before the TCG's tax year begins. The agreement must include a list of companies, their share capital, shareholder information, the agreement's duration, and the group's tax year.<br><br>TCGs simplify CIT settlement through consolidated income calculation. Income is the surplus of total income over total losses from the same revenue source across all group companies. Losses can be carried forward. Intra-group transactions are generally exempt from transfer pricing documentation, but market prices must still be applied. Transactions with related parties outside the group are subject to standard transfer pricing documentation requirements. VAT is handled independently by each company within the TCG, though VAT Groups offer similar tax planning advantages in the VAT context. Forming a TCG offers legal tax optimization benefits by consolidating income tax settlements and potentially reducing documentation burdens.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_451" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_451" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_451" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_452" style="display:none;">A VAT payer can be a large company or a sole proprietor. However, holding VAT payer status doesn't automatically define whether the entity is an active VAT payer (obliged to remit tax) or a passive one (exempt). VAT, or Value Added Tax, is a public levy remitted to the State Treasury. In Poland, whether an entity is subject to VAT depends on whether they are eligible for VAT exemptions under the law.<br><br>There are two main types of VAT exemptions: subject-matter exemptions, based on the type of service or item being taxed, and personal exemptions, related to the entity conducting the business that would normally be taxed. Subject-matter exemptions exclude specific services and items from VAT, as listed in Article 43(1) of the VAT Act. Personal exemptions, according to Article 113(1) of the VAT Act, are available to entrepreneurs whose taxable sales did not exceed 200,000 PLN in the previous tax year.<br><br>This limit applies to annual sales, and is prorated for businesses starting mid-year. Those using the personal exemption must track sales to avoid losing eligibility. Exceeding the 200,000 PLN limit requires immediate registration as an active VAT payer, with penalties for non-compliance. Article 113(13) lists goods and services always subject to VAT, regardless of sales value.<br><br>Entrepreneurs can simultaneously utilize both subject-matter and personal exemptions, provided they meet the specific criteria for each. For instance, a business providing services exempt under Article 43(1) can also use the personal exemption if its sales of taxable goods are below 200,000 PLN and the goods aren't excluded under Article 113(13).

It's a banking service that enables efficient management of funds and debt limits by balancing the balances between company accounts. Surplus funds are transferred from companies with excess cash to those with deficits, managed through a "Pool Leader."<br><br>Cash pooling agreements, common within tax capital groups, aim to facilitate the efficient financing of participants' working capital needs. The operation depends on internal group agreements, notably the method of fund distribution. While flexibility in structuring agreements offers advantages, tax implications must be considered.<br><br>Cash pooling agreements, not explicitly defined in the Civil Code, resemble loan agreements but aren't treated as such. Unlike loans, there's no obligation to transfer a specific amount to a designated entity. This is because a participant with surplus funds cannot determine how much of their funds will be used or by whom, as confirmed by the National Tax Information Director. Therefore, cash pooling isn't subject to civil law transaction tax.<br><br>Withholding tax applies if a foreign company participates in cash pooling. Interest payments under the agreement require the payer to collect withholding tax. It's crucial to determine the recipient of the interest income to apply the correct double taxation avoidance agreement. The payer must determine the taxpayer's residency to apply the appropriate double taxation avoidance agreement, potentially reducing or eliminating the tax if a tax residency certificate is provided. Ultimately, the actual owner of the interest must be verified, and the relevant double taxation treaty's provisions must be determined.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_454" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_454" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_454" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_457" style="display:none;">Entrepreneurs, especially those undertaking time-consuming and costly projects, often utilize the right to receive partial payment from a contractor before service delivery or goods provision. By collecting an advance payment, they can secure themselves against potential risks associated with the buyer's failure to meet contractual terms. The time discrepancy between receiving payment and completing an order can raise accounting and tax concerns. While domestic transactions, including those with advance payments, are common, foreign currency advances present true uncertainty.<br><br>This guide details the step-by-step process for taxpayers receiving advance payments in foreign currency. Upon receiving a foreign currency advance, the amount must be recorded in accounting books at the average exchange rate declared by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) from the preceding day. Subsequently, an advance invoice must be issued, no later than the 15th day of the month following receipt of payment. This invoice should reflect the exchange rate from the last working day before the tax liability arises, typically the day before receiving the advance. Notably, issuing an advance invoice does not create CIT liability; income is recognized upon service completion or goods delivery. Advance invoices can also be issued up to 60 days before receipt, using the NBP rate from the day before the invoice date.<br><br>Upon delivery or service completion, revenue is recognized. If the advance covers the entire order, a final invoice isn't mandatory. Advances previously recorded in deferred income accounts should be reclassified to revenue at the exchange rate of the day before delivery, accounting for any currency differences. If the advance doesn't cover the full order, a final invoice is required for the remaining balance, valued at the NBP rate from the day before delivery. Taxable currency differences are calculated only on net amounts; VAT differences are tax-neutral.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_457" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_457" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_457" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_458" style="display:none;">Since 2021, amendments to the VAT Act have regulated e-commerce activities, implementing EU Directive 2020/284. These changes apply to all e-commerce businesses. A new draft law, expected to take effect on January 1, 2024, aims to further close VAT loopholes in the e-commerce sector.<br><br>The 2021 amendments introduced definitions for distance selling of goods within the EU and imported goods, along with the One Stop Shop (OSS) system for easier VAT declaration and payment for cross-border transactions. This includes Import One Stop Shop (IOSS), Union One Stop Shop (UOSS), and Non-union One Stop Shop (NUOSS). The IOSS procedure simplifies VAT payment and reporting for distance sales, notably by removing the €22 VAT exemption for imported goods. VAT is now collected at the point of sale by the seller for imported goods sold to EU consumers from third countries. Goods processed through IOSS are exempt from import VAT, and if they meet IOSS special procedure conditions, they also benefit from the exemption for goods valued up to €150, effectively negating the impact of the removed €22 exemption. A valid VAT identification number is required for these exemptions.<br><br>Further amendments impose reporting obligations on payment service providers for cross-border payments exceeding 25 transactions per quarter. These records will be shared with tax authorities and then submitted to the CESOP system by the 10th day of the second month following the reporting quarter. CESOP, a centralized electronic system for payment information, will facilitate cross-member state administrative cooperation to combat tax fraud and VAT gaps, managed at the EU level by the European Commission. It will collect data on cross-border transactions where payers and payees are in different member states or when the payee is in a third country. Reporting entities include credit institutions, electronic money institutions, and payment service providers.<br><br>The ongoing updates to the VAT Act underscore its susceptibility to tax fraud and the continuous efforts to close VAT gaps. The latest proposed amendment, driven by the need to exchange payment information within the e-commerce sector, is currently awaiting parliamentary approval, with a planned effective date of July 1, 2024, though this may change.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>Since 2021, Poland has been implementing EU directives to regulate e-commerce, focusing on closing VAT loopholes. Key changes include defining distance sales and introducing the One Stop Shop (OSS) system for simplified VAT management of cross-border transactions. The Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) procedure has been crucial, removing the VAT exemption for low-value imported goods and shifting VAT collection to the point of sale for sellers based outside the EU. This also allows for VAT exemption on imports for goods up to €150 if processed under IOSS. A new draft law, expected to be effective from July 1, 2024, will further enhance VAT collection in e-commerce. This includes new reporting obligations for payment service providers regarding cross-border transactions, with data to be shared through the EU's Central Electronic System of Payment information (CESOP) to combat tax fraud.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_459" style="display:none;">Depreciation is a crucial aspect for companies holding fixed assets with a useful life exceeding one year, used in business operations. Depreciation charges are made to account for the loss of value of fixed assets due to usage and to determine their current value. Tax depreciation amounts represent a tax-deductible expense for businesses, thereby reducing the tax base.<br><br>Tax and accounting depreciation differ. While companies must depreciate for both purposes, tax depreciation reduces the tax base by classifying depreciation as a deductible expense. The tax law permits straight-line and declining-balance methods. Straight-line amortizes acquisition or production costs evenly over the asset's life. Declining-balance allows larger deductions in early years, tapering off later, with the deduction amount dependent on the chosen declining-balance rate. Accounting law offers more flexibility, not dictating specific depreciation methods.<br><br>Depreciation for tax purposes begins the month after an asset is recorded. Charges are made from the initial value of intangible assets or fixed assets, either monthly, quarterly, or as a lump sum annually (except for the declining-balance method). Initial value is the acquisition price, production cost, or market value at acquisition if obtained through donation or inheritance. Depreciation is based on the asset's classification according to the Standard Classification of Fixed Assets (KŚT) and the selection of an appropriate depreciation rate.<br><br>Investment relief allows companies to deduct a portion of expenses for new fixed assets from the tax base. This enables one-off depreciation charges on the initial value of newly acquired assets in the year they are recorded, for specific asset categories like machinery and equipment. One-off depreciation is limited to PLN 100,000 annually if an asset's initial value is at least PLN 10,000, or if the combined initial value of at least two assets acquired in a year reaches PLN 10,000, provided each individual asset's initial value does not exceed PLN 3,500.<br><br>Assets with an initial value below PLN 10,000 can be subject to a one-off depreciation charge in the month of use or the following month. Alternatively, no depreciation may be recorded, with acquisition costs treated as expenses in the month of use.<br><br>Certain assets are excluded from tax depreciation, including land, perpetual usufruct rights, residential buildings, art, museum exhibits, goodwill (unless acquired under specific conditions), and assets not in use due to business suspension or cessation. Perpetual usufruct rights, unlike land itself, can be amortized for accounting purposes, reflecting the distribution of their acquisition cost over their period of use.<br><br>Depreciation is essential for businesses, reducing the tax base by treating depreciation charges as expenses. However, accounting and tax depreciation rules vary in rates, commencement times, and inclusions.<br><br>Amortization is a critical component of business accounting, allowing for the reduction of the taxable base by recognizing depreciation charges as deductible expenses. It's important to note that the rules for making depreciation charges differ for accounting versus tax purposes. These differences include depreciation rates, the timing of charge commencement, and inclusions.<br><br>Depreciation is a crucial accounting practice for businesses, enabling them to reduce their taxable income by treating depreciation charges as deductible expenses. Companies must adhere to different depreciation rules for financial reporting and tax purposes, which can vary in terms of rates, when charges begin, and what is included in the calculation. This process helps determine an asset's current value and its impact on the company's financial health.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_459" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_459" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_459" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_461" style="display:none;">On April 13th, a draft deregulation law was published to improve the legal and institutional environment for businesses, including changes to tax law. The law aims to simplify every stage of starting and running a business.<br><br>The package is built on four pillars: facilitating starting a business, simplifying business operations, streamlining succession, and creating business-friendly economic law. It addresses entrepreneurs' needs by reducing regulations, leading to time and cost savings. This includes clearer rules for unregistered businesses and minors starting businesses, aiming to eliminate legal loopholes.<br><br>The law seeks to improve relations between businesses and public administration by reducing in-person visits, providing advance notice of audits with document lists, and reducing paperwork. The use of stamps will also be limited.<br><br>Succession is streamlined through automatic extensions of succession management, consistent bank account access for succession managers, joint exercise of rights to shares, and reduced requirements for establishing succession management.<br><br>Business law will be more friendly to businesses through the "one in, one out" principle, mandatory ex-post regulatory impact assessments, and a cyclical regulatory policy every four years.<br><br>Changes are also proposed for the Tax Ordinance, CIT, and local taxes. The Tax Ordinance would allow waiving appeal procedures if the party agrees with the first-instance decision. MDR-3 form signatures could be made by proxy. The law aims to provide a closed list of tax-related information required in tax strategies. Also, a central source of information on local tax rates will be created. Finally, average rye and wood prices for agricultural and forestry taxes would be determined by July 20th, instead of October 20th.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_461" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_461" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_461" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_462" style="display:none;">Since January 2023, the Polish Fiscal Penal Code has tightened regulations regarding transfer pricing, with potentially fluctuating higher fines throughout the year. Failure to comply with transfer pricing documentation obligations can result in penalties under both the Fiscal Penal Code and the Tax Ordinance. Sanctions can be levied for failing to prepare local transfer pricing documentation, omitting group documentation, submitting documentation late, or providing inaccurate transfer pricing information.<br><br>The Fiscal Penal Code imposes penalties up to 720 daily rates (potentially up to PLN 33.5 million) for non-preparation or inaccurate documentation, and up to 240 daily rates (potentially up to PLN 11.17 million) for late submission. Failure to submit transfer pricing information or submitting inaccurate data also carries a penalty of up to 720 daily rates, while late TPR form submission incurs a penalty of up to 240 daily rates. Lesser offenses may result in fines for fiscal violations.<br><br>The Tax Ordinance also stipulates penalties, with rates of 10% applied to improperly understated or overstated amounts. This increases to 20% if the documentation is incomplete or not provided, or if the additional tax liability exceeds PLN 15 million. The maximum rate of 30% applies if documentation is not submitted and the additional tax liability exceeds PLN 15 million. If incomplete documentation is fully supplemented within 14 days, the lack of documentation is waived.<br><br>Transfer pricing controls are becoming more frequent and stringent, especially when companies show losses for more than a year, make significant post-year-end adjustments, exhibit low profitability, have high debt, experience significant year-over-year profitability changes, or have a high share of group charges. Common errors include failing to prepare Local Files, improperly identifying homogeneous transactions, and neglecting to document free services.<br><br>Taxpayers often have queries about reorganization processes subject to documentation and how to perform comparative analysis. The penalties for non-compliance with transfer pricing documentation are among the most restrictive in Europe.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_462" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_462" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_462" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_463" style="display:none;">Most taxpayers encounter situations requiring them to issue or receive corrective invoices (adjusting invoices) for goods or services. These corrections can stem from various reasons such as price errors, discrepancies in the quantity of goods, or discounts. The question then arises: when can VAT be deducted from these corrective invoices?<br><br>Before 2021, the process was straightforward for "minus" corrections: the taxpayer signed and returned the invoice, and the seller accounted for VAT upon receiving it. There were no regulations for "plus" corrections, the practice depended on the cause of the correction.<br><br>Since 2021, the SLIM VAT package introduced changes, emphasizing the need for documentation confirming agreed-upon correction terms and their fulfillment. Agreements can be documented through contracts, amendments, emails, or seller's website terms.<br><br>For sellers issuing "minus" corrective invoices, the correction is accounted for when the invoice is issued, provided documentation confirms agreed terms. Without this documentation, the correction is only included in the JPK declaration for the period the documentation is obtained. For "plus" corrections, the adjustment is made in the period the correction's cause occurred, whether it's an initial error, corrected retroactively to the original period, or a secondary cause, accounted for in the current period.<br><br>Buyers receiving "minus" corrections must also possess documentation confirming agreed terms with the seller, accounting for the correction in the period they obtain this documentation, provided the original invoice was recorded. For "plus" corrections, the input VAT can be deducted in the period the corrective invoice is received or in the subsequent three periods.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_463" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_463" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_463" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_465" style="display:none;">Polish tax law requires businesses to report tax schemes, a regulation introduced in 2019 but temporarily suspended during the pandemic. These regulations are expected to return, and failure to comply can result in significant penalties. A tax scheme is an arrangement, whether current or future, involving at least one taxpayer, designed to create a tax advantage through deliberate utilization of available tools. This applies to both domestic and cross-border transactions.<br><br>The reporting obligation falls on promoters (those who design and implement the scheme), beneficiaries (those who benefit from the scheme), and supporting entities (those involved in its development or supervision). Identifying when a scheme arises is complex, requiring careful documentation. All involved parties must be notified.<br><br>Internal procedures for managing tax schemes are mandatory for entities meeting the definition of promoters and those employing or compensating promoters. Such entities must also exceed a revenue or cost threshold of 8,000,000 PLN in the preceding year.<br><br>Ambiguities exist regarding which transactions require reporting, such as operational leasing agreements. While a leasing agreement may satisfy a general hallmark from the lessor's perspective, whether the lessee achieves a tax benefit is assessed on the particulars of the case.<br><br>Ultimately, businesses must continuously monitor and analyze their activities to ensure compliance with evolving reporting requirements. The complexity of these regulations increases the likelihood of encountering reportable events or transactions.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_465" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_465" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_465" style="display:none;"></p>

A similar exemption applies if the company has a social and welfare fund in place of ZFŚS.<br><br>Benefits paid to employees from ZFŚS are subject to full enforcement. These benefits are not treated as wages. Enforcement requires a relevant enforcement title.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_468" style="display:none;">The project regarding collective labor disputes is currently under discussion with social partners in the Social Dialogue Council. A key aspect is introducing the concept of a "dominant employer," defined as an employer or entrepreneur who exerts significant influence over another employer or entrepreneur, particularly through ownership or organizational ties. This aims to address situations where the actual decision-maker isn't the direct employer, enabling collective bargaining with the entity holding real power over employee rights and working conditions.<br><br>The draft law also defines a collective labor dispute as a disagreement between employees and employers concerning collective rights, freedoms, or interests related to employment. It stipulates that multiple unions must form a joint representation for negotiations. The proposed law limits the duration of a dispute to nine months, extendable by agreement to twelve, after which it must conclude with an agreement, a record of disagreements followed by a vote and strike, or it expires. To reinforce mediation, the project aims to enhance the standards and requirements for mediators and maintain a public list of mediators managed by the minister. A party requesting mediation must inform the other party and include a record of disagreements. Preventive mediation is also introduced to de-escalate conflicts during negotiations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_468" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_468" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_468" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_469" style="display:none;">VAT tax control is a crucial tool for tax authorities, aimed at combating tax fraud and ensuring the proper functioning of the tax system. It involves checking whether taxpayers comply with tax regulations and avoid irregularities. Significant discrepancies between input and output VAT can trigger an investigation, which must stay within the scope defined by the authorization. Both businesses and individuals registered for VAT can be subject to these controls.<br><br>VAT is highly susceptible to abuse due to its neutral, transferable nature. While businesses have the right to deduct input VAT, this mechanism can be exploited through schemes like carousel fraud, which aim to defraud the state via fictitious transactions. International trade also presents risks of tax evasion due to differing tax laws and rates across borders, often exacerbated by poor accounting practices.<br><br>Tax controls serve a preventative role. Taxpayers receive advance notification, typically 7 to 30 days before an audit. During a control, tax authorities may request accounting documents, conduct interviews with employees, and examine specific periods or the entire operational history. Actions include analyzing accounting records and VAT registers, verifying the consistency of goods/services with tax declarations, and ensuring correct VAT rate application. Cross-control procedures examine transactions between two entities to detect discrepancies and fraud.<br><br>To minimize the risk of a VAT audit, businesses should maintain accurate accounting records, apply correct VAT rates, and implement due diligence procedures for verifying business partners, including checking their bank account registration on the "white list" and the legitimacy of transactions. The split payment mechanism, where VAT is paid to a separate VAT account, enhances payment transparency.<br><br>If notified of an audit, taxpayers should rectify any errors in their documentation, ensure all financial records are organized and accessible, verify compliance with regulations, and prepare for potential questions from tax inspectors. Internal audits are also recommended for early error detection and correction.<br><br>In summary, VAT tax control is essential for maintaining the integrity of the tax system and fighting fraud. Taxpayers are obligated to keep accurate records, but the dynamic nature of tax law, particularly for fraud-prone taxes like VAT, often necessitates audits. Implementing internal procedures and seeking professional advice can significantly mitigate tax risks and the likelihood of an audit.<br><br>agnieszka.drozdz-wilk@moorepolska.pl</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_469" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_469" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_469" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_470" style="display:none;">The obligation to pay withholding tax on income earned in Poland applies to both residents and non-residents. Withholding tax (WHT) is a flat tax on income for individuals and legal entities who are non-residents, specifically when they earn income in Poland. The Polish payer is responsible for withholding and remitting this tax. Certain situations may also require Polish residents to pay WHT, such as dividend payments to domestic entities.<br><br>WHT applies to intangible services and income derived from interest, royalties, rights to inventions, trademarks, designs, as well as fees for using industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, know-how, and services related to entertainment or sports performed by foreign entities. It also covers fees for cargo and passenger transport by foreign shipping companies from Polish ports (excluding transit), income of foreign airlines from Polish operations (excluding scheduled passenger transport), and dividends or other profit distributions. The scope can be influenced by double taxation treaties.<br><br>Key considerations for WHT include exercising due diligence when withholding tax or applying reduced rates/exemptions. This involves verifying document accuracy, the recipient's tax residency, and the counterparty's status as a taxpayer. Confirming beneficial ownership, meaning the recipient is the true owner of the income and conducts genuine business activity, is also crucial for tax preferences.<br><br>The "pay and refund" mechanism allows for tax withholding and subsequent refund requests. A 2,000,000 PLN limit applies to payments of WHT-liable income to the same taxpayer. Exceeding this limit requires withholding the statutory rate (19% or 20%). Refunds can be claimed by the taxpayer or payer, with a typical verification period of six months, potentially extending to nine. Failure to refund within the statutory period incurs interest. Tax authorities may approve or deny refund requests through a decision, which can be appealed. The complexity of WHT, especially regarding due diligence and verification, often leads to disputes.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_470" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_470" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_470" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_473" style="display:none;">In theory, VAT covers the paid supply of goods and services within the country. However, unpaid services can also be taxable. When providing unpaid services to employees, it's crucial to understand the VAT implications. VAT applies to paid supply of goods, services, exports, imports, and intra-community transactions. The transfer of the right to dispose of goods as an owner, including free transfers and consumption for personal use by the taxpayer or employees, is considered a taxable supply of goods if the taxpayer had the right to deduct VAT. Unpaid services for personal use, including those for employees, are also taxable.<br><br>However, unpaid services not related to business activities are exempt. The connection between the service and the business is key. Employee accommodation is generally considered personal, but if necessary for work efficiency, it may not be taxable. This often depends on the necessity of lodging near the workplace, away from the employee's residence. Free transportation to work is usually taxable, unless it's the only way for employees to reach work, thus benefiting the employer's business. Gifts are exempt if of small value (up to 20 PLN) or, with proper records, up to 100 PLN per person per year. In conclusion, assess the primary purpose of unpaid services, ensuring it's linked to business operations rather than solely benefiting the employee personally, to determine VAT obligations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_473" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_473" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_473" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_474" style="display:none;">The article discusses the transfer of gift vouchers and income tax implications, building upon a previous discussion of fundamental aspects.<br><br>Regarding voucher transfers, the VAT treatment depends on whether the voucher is for a single or multiple purposes. For single-purpose vouchers transferred by an intermediary on behalf of the issuer, the transfer is considered a supply of goods or services by the issuer. The distributor accounts for VAT on their intermediary services, while the issuer is liable for VAT on the voucher sale. Free transfers are treated as free supplies. If a foreign business without a presence in Poland transfers a single-purpose voucher to a Polish VAT payer, the Polish buyer is responsible for VAT if the supply location is in Poland.<br><br>For multi-purpose vouchers, when transferred by someone other than the issuer, only intermediary services like distribution or promotion are subject to VAT. The issuer is responsible for VAT when the vouchers are redeemed; the transfer to the distributor is not taxable.<br><br>Regarding income tax, revenue is recognized when goods are delivered or services are rendered, or at the latest, when an invoice is issued or payment is made, according to the Accounting Act and the Corporate Income Tax Act. Issuing a voucher doesn't create revenue, but redeeming it does, regardless of the voucher type. If a voucher expires unused, revenue is recognized on the expiration date.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_474" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_474" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_474" style="display:none;"></p>

These include:<br><br>**Margins, Profitability, and Break-Even Point:** Understanding the company's market (retail, wholesale, etc.) and tracking margins, sales profitability, and break-even points for new projects are crucial. Margin analysis reveals how much profit each sale generates and identifying downward trends is vital.<br><br>**Liquidity and Cash Resources:** Companies fail due to liquidity issues, not just lack of profit. Monitoring working capital, inventory turnover, and receivables collection is essential. Assessing liquidity ratios is also important, especially during annual reviews.<br><br>**Investments, Debt, and Capital Negotiations:** The Supervisory Board approves business strategy and related investments. Understanding the consequences of loans, debt agreements, and capital increases (interest rates, currency risk) is a must. Reviewing loan covenants is also critical.<br><br>**Internal Control Systems - Risks, New Operations, Fraud:** Supervisory Boards should actively engage with the COSO framework. It's important to review the internal control system annually, especially during rapid development. Implementing "four eyes principle" and reviewing management authority can support fraud detection.<br><br>**IT Systems - Business Continuity, Data Integration and Security:** Ensuring IT systems have backup plans, data is archived, and recovery tested are essential. Solving data integration problems leads to business success.<br><br>**Business Model and Changing Expectations (ESG):** Regularly testing the business model and comparing it to competitors can result in innovative activities and strengthen the business model. Furthermore, taking into account the impact of the organization on the ecosystem is increasingly important.<br><br>Ultimately, being a Supervisory Board member requires critical and non-linear thinking. Questioning assumptions to strengthen the organization and finding areas for improvement allows the business to develop more strongly.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_475" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_475" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_475" style="display:none;"></p>

Scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2023, it builds upon previous SLIM VAT packages from 2021, which addressed international transactions and VAT deduction deadlines.<br><br>SLIM VAT 3 includes raising the small taxpayer sales limit to 2 million euros, allowing VAT account funds to be used for retail sales tax, and eliminating the requirement to possess an invoice for intra-community acquisition of goods when deducting VAT. It also reduces the number of necessary adjustments, simplifies VAT accounting by waiving corrections if the difference between preliminary and final proportions doesn't exceed 2%, streamlines reporting for sales using cash registers, and unifies regulations for Binding Rate Information (WIS), Binding Tariff Information (WIT), Binding Excise Information (WIA) and Binding Origin Information (WIP). The fee for a WIS application will be abolished, and a spending review process will be implemented in public finance.<br><br>The package was also influenced by the CJEU ruling C-935/19, which calls for VAT sanctions to be proportionate to the nature of the offense. Sanctions will be applied at the authorities' discretion, based on the nature of the activity and taxpayer's due diligence. Maximum sanctions should be applied only in the case of tax fraud.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_477" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_477" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_477" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_478" style="display:none;">A good leader possesses qualities like leadership, empathy, and respect. They understand business, make sound decisions, and care about the organization. Communication and persuasion skills are vital, as is self-criticism. Crucially, they guide a team of diverse individuals, fostering their development, not just managing tasks. Being a good leader is challenging and not for everyone.<br><br>Contrary to the image of an infallible perfectionist, a good leader is not without flaws. Their strength lies in self-assessment, enabling continuous growth. Perfection isn't the goal; rather, it's about expanding knowledge and preventing stagnation within the team. If doubts exist about one's ability to guide others effectively, it's better to step aside. Leadership isn't necessarily teachable; some are naturally inclined, while others excel as experts. Combining both roles requires significant self-improvement and a commitment to learning.<br><br>Good leaders possess numerous qualities that aren't always easily learned, but are honed over time. They are multidimensional, creative, and knowledgeable, building teams that complement each other. They unite and motivate, communicate honestly about successes and failures, and sometimes act as mediators. Clear communication is essential, whether listening, advising, or making tough decisions.<br><br>Thirteen key traits of a good leader include: good leadership, honesty, respecting opinions, valuing others, asking questions instead of commanding, persuasiveness, offering approval, driving the team to success, trusting employees, active listening, clear communication, decisive decision-making, and commitment to continuous development. A good leader is also a good business partner, professional and transparent.

The choice depends on factors like whether the member is a shareholder, the employment duration, and associated costs.<br><br>Appointment is often preferred for its simplicity. Until recently, it was attractive due to the lack of mandatory social security contributions, although health insurance is still required. Employment contracts are increasingly scrutinized by ZUS, requiring clear separation of duties and genuine positions within the company. Civil law contracts are considered safer from ZUS challenges, but their content must avoid resembling employment contracts to avoid similar social security obligations.<br><br>Board members are entitled to remuneration, usually determined by shareholder resolution for appointments and by contract terms for employment or civil law agreements. Termination can occur through dismissal, death, mandate expiration, or resignation. Resignations must be submitted to shareholders, and may result in liability for damages caused by sudden departure without a valid reason. Proper documentation of activities is crucial for potential audits.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_479" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_479" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_479" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_480" style="display:none;">Tax succession involves the transfer of rights and obligations from one entity to another resulting from a transformation or significant structural change in the original entity. It typically occurs when a sole proprietorship expands and becomes a company, or when an existing company undergoes changes in its legal form. Restructuring requires careful consideration of both organizational and tax consequences.<br><br>Company transformations are regulated in the commercial companies code, encompassing changes between different types of partnerships or capital companies. These modifications in legal form may be driven by the desire to alter the distribution of rights and obligations, organizational structure, business expansion, or mergers and acquisitions. Transforming a capital company into a partnership can be particularly complex due to the taxation of undistributed profits. Companies undergoing liquidation or bankruptcy cannot be transformed.<br><br>Tax succession resulting from company transformations is governed by the Tax Ordinance. The newly formed legal entity assumes all rights and obligations of the transformed company. In case of conflicting regulations between the general Tax Ordinance and specific tax laws, the latter prevails.<br><br>Transforming a sole proprietorship into a single-person capital company involves specific rules regarding tax succession, focusing on the succession of rights rather than obligations. This excludes the entrepreneur's personal liability for obligations.<br><br>In conclusion, company transformations result in new obligations stemming from tax succession as outlined in the Tax Ordinance. While transformations facilitate business expansion, it's essential to assess potential tax burdens and consequences.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_480" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_480" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_480" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_481" style="display:none;">In today's business environment, effective management requires more than just industry expertise. Leaders need a grasp of economics, business psychology, finance, law, and taxation. This multifaceted demand has led to a shift where managers and owners seek a "business partner" in their finance and accounting professionals. These partners, armed with the right knowledge, can simplify complex business realities into analyzable facts for management.<br><br>This article outlines key discussions between business owners, boards, and finance professionals who embrace the business partner role. A critical question managers often pose is, "Can we afford this?" This seemingly simple query triggers a deep dive into current financial health, profitability drivers, short-to-medium term forecasts, cash flow projections, and the allocation of any surplus funds.<br><br>A common source of frustration for executives is the disconnect between accounting profit and actual cash availability. This arises from the accrual basis of accounting (memoriał) versus the cash basis (kasowa). Accrual accounting recognizes revenue and expenses when earned or incurred, not necessarily when cash changes hands. For instance, sales are recorded upon delivery, not payment. Similarly, purchases with deferred payment terms impact cash later. VAT further complicates this by requiring payment on sales tax differences, irrespective of actual cash received.<br><br>A proficient financial analyst can bridge this gap by analyzing revenue-to-cash conversion rates and the timing of expenses. They connect profitability metrics with liquidity and working capital management, examining receivables, payables, and inventory. Understanding where a business earns the most is paramount for strategic resource allocation. Profitability, defined as the difference between selling price and costs, necessitates a granular understanding of all associated expenses. Pricing strategies are crucial; poorly set prices can lead to business failure.<br><br>Future-oriented questions about interest rates, currency exchange rates, and the cost of energy or raw materials are vital for planning. Financial directors and chief accountants monitor economic indicators to forecast future margins, profits, cash flows, and costs. While forecasts are not exact, they provide sufficient accuracy to navigate business operations and mitigate risks.<br><br>Regarding tax optimization, it's achievable but depends on an owner's risk appetite. While accountants are inherently cautious, business owners should collaborate on tax strategies, as interpretations and legal precedents evolve. Seeking external expertise can ensure optimal tax planning.<br><br>The decision between purchasing, leasing, or financing assets varies. While large corporations have centralized decisions, smaller entities benefit from expert financial advice tailored to their specific goals and financial position. Ultimately, a good financial partner, understanding the CEO's vision, can guide these crucial decisions, identifying both opportunities and risks within the business, thereby significantly influencing its successful development.<br><br>Contact: piotr.witek@moorepolska.pl</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_481" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_481" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_481" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_482" style="display:none;">Employee wellbeing encompasses more than just fair pay and benefits; it requires a holistic approach. It includes a positive work atmosphere, satisfactory compensation, and development opportunities. Beyond these, perks like team-building activities, relaxation areas, bonuses, and holiday gifts contribute. Ultimately, wellbeing is about an employee's overall quality of life, a concept particularly important for younger generations entering the workforce.<br><br>Gallup identifies five key elements of wellbeing: finding meaning in daily work, strong workplace relationships, financial security, good physical health, and a positive connection to one's community. Research indicates that healthy employees are significantly more productive, engaged, and have lower absenteeism rates.<br><br>Despite efforts, many companies struggle with employee wellbeing, often focusing on engagement metrics without genuine implementation. Common pitfalls include treating engagement as a mere survey or program rather than a continuous practice, prioritizing survey data over people development, and defining engagement as simply the absence of dissatisfaction instead of genuine enthusiasm. Companies also err by relying on metrics that provide flattering results rather than those that identify organizational issues.<br><br>The synergy between wellbeing and work-life balance hinges on employee appreciation. Recognized employees who feel valued are more productive. Fostering a sense of importance and belonging encourages employees to take on challenges and minimize errors. A company's commitment to wellbeing reflects its organizational culture, leading to happier, more productive employees, a better work-life balance, and attracting new talent, ultimately driving growth and success. Investing in employee wellbeing yields significant returns across multiple dimensions.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_482" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_482" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_482" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_483" style="display:none;">Development works have long been present in Polish balance sheets, with established knowledge and best practices now available. It's a misnomer to claim ignorance, as the landscape has significantly shifted. Striving to make development works a source of pride, not a weakness, is achievable. Tools exist to support this, including grant agreements from entities like NCBR, which often necessitate revenue forecasts, success criteria, and TRL scale assessments.<br><br>Development works remain a challenging asset due to specific accounting requirements lacking practical examples, the inherent variability of R&D projects, skepticism from auditors and external users, significant asset values attracting scrutiny, reliance on estimates increasing error risk, and potential misuse for artificial profit enhancement by deferring current costs. This often leads to analysts treating these assets as worthless.<br><br>Five common myths CFOs fall for regarding development works include: viewing them as a quick profitability booster, which can mask liquidity issues and lead to over-investment; extending amortization periods, creating a ticking time bomb for future write-downs; believing no one will notice these significant balance sheet items; assuming no one knows how to properly account for them, despite available tools and guidance; and accepting the notion that development works are inherently fraudulent, which is untrue unless misused for financial misrepresentation. Proper management and use of tools can ensure development works are a strength.<br><br>Development works, when managed correctly, represent genuine investment that should yield returns, not a tool for financial manipulation. Companies whose core business relies on internally developed technology are adept at managing these investments, using available tools to monitor progress and profitability. The aim should be to ensure development works are a point of pride in financial statements, not a vulnerability.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_483" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_483" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_483" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_484" style="display:none;">Gift vouchers are commonly understood by consumers as a way to acquire goods or services without depleting their personal budget. However, for a voucher to be received, it must first be issued and enter circulation. This introduces the issuer, a business entity, which must account for gift vouchers as economic events.<br><br>This article delves into gift vouchers, focusing on their legal essence, types, and accounting treatment, including VAT. A voucher is legally defined by the VAT Act as consideration for the supply of goods or services, where these items or their suppliers can be identified. Vouchers are payment instruments, distinct from discount cards.<br><br>The VAT Act distinguishes two types of vouchers: single-purpose vouchers, where the place of supply, services, and VAT amount are known at issuance, and multi-purpose vouchers, where at least one of these elements is unknown at issuance. Issuing a voucher means its first introduction into circulation, while issuance and subsequent transfers are considered voucher transfers. Vouchers can be physical or electronic, paid or free.<br><br>From a VAT perspective, the tax obligation is crucial. While issuing a voucher does not create a tax obligation, its redemption does. Vouchers are initially recorded as deferred revenue. The distinction between single-purpose and multi-purpose vouchers is key for VAT. For single-purpose vouchers, VAT is due upon sale; for multi-purpose vouchers, VAT is due upon redemption. Small taxpayers using the cash method are exempt from VAT on single-purpose voucher transactions. Income tax related to vouchers will be covered in a subsequent part.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_484" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_484" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_484" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_485" style="display:none;">The Estonian CIT, or lump-sum CIT on company income, shifts taxation from the difference between taxable revenue and costs to the taxation of accounting profit upon profit distribution. While it simplifies accounting, it requires initial obligations. Companies adopting Estonian CIT for 2023 must present specific equity items in their December 31, 2022 balance sheets: undistributed and distributed profits earned before the first year of lump-sum taxation, and uncovered losses from prior years. Standard balance sheet templates may not accommodate these, but greater detail is permissible per accounting law.<br><br>A preliminary adjustment is necessary to reconcile tax and accounting results. This involves including accounting revenues not recognized as taxable, and taxable costs not recognized as accounting costs, and vice versa. This adjustment may create a provisional liability that expires after four years of Estonian CIT application, classifying it as a contingent liability.<br><br>Companies under Estonian CIT must also disclose income from hidden profits in their financial statement footnotes. Additionally, deferred tax assets and provisions should be derecognized if the company is expected to continue with Estonian CIT, as they won't be utilized in tax settlements, impacting the preceding year's financial results.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_485" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_485" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_485" style="display:none;"></p>

He discussed his motivation for choosing this career, its evolution over three decades, and the value of being a statutory auditor. The profession's roots trace back nearly a century to a Ministry of Finance project for "expert accountants" aimed at detecting tax offenses. The term "statutory auditor" first appeared in a 1928 presidential decree, defining their role in examining financial reports of joint-stock companies. The modern profession emerged alongside economic reforms after 1989, leading to the establishment of the National Chamber of Statutory Auditors in 1992, marking 2023 as the 30th anniversary of the current self-governing body and profession.<br><br>Witek, an auditor for 21 years, was influenced by his mother, Lucyna Witek, also a statutory auditor and founder of a successful accounting firm.

Currently, he manages a team of nearly 250 professionals across nine offices in Poland, emphasizing employee development and success.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_487" style="display:none;">Polish entrepreneurs often have an obligation to prepare annual environmental reports and pay environmental fees. This article details the types of environmental reports and their submission deadlines.<br><br>The "Report/Information on the Scope of Environmental Use and Environmental Fees" is due by March 31st. This report quantifies emissions of greenhouse gases, dust, and stored pollutants, forming the basis for calculating environmental fees. Entities using the environment are responsible for determining their fees for the period of use. This reporting obligation applies to various entities, including sole proprietorships, companies, cooperatives, legal persons, foreign entrepreneurs, agricultural producers, legal entities without legal personality but with legal capacity, and individuals whose environmental use requires a permit. The report, submitted to the provincial governor, includes data on substances introduced into the air, greenhouse gas emissions, and stored waste, along with the calculated fees. There's an exemption from submitting these reports if the annual fee for each type of environmental use does not exceed PLN 100. Furthermore, the environmental fee itself is due by March 31st of the following year, with no payment required if the total annual fee is less than PLN 800.<br><br>The "Report on Waste Generation and Management" is due by March 15th. This report aims to improve waste management systems, combat the grey economy and illegal landfills, and enhance recycling efficiency, ultimately protecting public health and the planet. It is prepared by waste producers who are required to keep records, entities managing waste (excluding municipal waste collectors in terms of collection and processing), and those extracting waste from landfills with appropriate consent. The report, submitted electronically via the BDO database to the relevant provincial governor, includes identification data and information on the mass and types of waste.<br><br>The "Report on Products, Packaging, and Waste Generated from Them" is also due by March 15th. This detailed report is for the annual accounting of environmental use and associated fees, mandated for specific entities. These include those introducing and exporting packaging, products in packaging, retail or wholesale businesses offering plastic shopping bags subject to a recycling fee, entities introducing products covered by product fee regulations, importers of vehicles subject to recycling laws, and those introducing equipment, authorized representatives, batteries, or accumulators. The report, submitted to the provincial governor based on the entrepreneur's registered address, contains identification data and information on the mass and types of packaging.<br><br>Environmental reports are crucial for practical environmental protection, aiming to control emissions and waste disposal from various industrial and commercial activities. The data collected helps optimize environmental protection processes. Failure to submit these reports or pay the required fees by the deadlines can result in penalties, including interest and fines.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_487" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_487" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_487" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_488" style="display:none;">The modern business world is complex and globalized, necessitating trust and reliability in partnerships. This is where statutory audits become crucial. In Poland, companies exceeding two out of three thresholds—50 employees average, 2.5 million Euro balance sheet total, or 5 million Euro revenue—require mandatory financial statement audits. An audit provides an opinion on the financial statements, assuring stakeholders that they accurately reflect the company's true financial position.<br><br>Several factors influence auditor selection and service costs. Key among these are industry knowledge and expertize, the auditor's resources and timeline, brand reputation, international experience, and work culture. Industry expertise is vital for understanding complex valuations and business models. Adequate resources, including skilled personnel and technology, are necessary for timely and efficient audits, especially for large entities. A strong brand reputation ensures recognition and adherence to high standards, while international experience is critical for global businesses. Work culture impacts communication and accessibility to key personnel. The cost of audits varies significantly based on these factors, company size, and the accounting standards applied (Polish GAAP, IFRS, or US GAAP), ranging from tens of thousands for smaller entities to millions for large corporations.<br><br>auditors,audit,auditors,certified auditors,certified auditor,price,factors,cost,service cost,service,cooperation<br><br>Contact us<br>piotr.witek@moorepolska.pl</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_488" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_488" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_488" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_489" style="display:none;">This article explains the importance of a "accounting policy" document for businesses, especially when their accounting is handled by external parties. The Polish Accounting Act mandates that companies keeping full accounting records must have a written accounting policy. This document details how a company will conduct its accounting, including its financial year, reporting periods, valuation methods for assets and liabilities, how financial results are determined, and the principles for keeping books, such as the chart of accounts and classification of economic events. It also specifies data protection systems for accounting evidence.<br><br>The law outlines key elements for the accounting policy, but it's not exhaustive. The policy should be tailored to the specific nature of the business and may include methodologies for documenting operations, inventory principles, accruals, provisions, receivables valuation, inventory accounting, fixed asset registration and depreciation, and document archiving. The article criticizes the common mistake of treating the accounting policy as a mere formality. It highlights that the company's Head is ultimately responsible for this document, but the accountant's expertise in accounting methods and system limitations is crucial. Collaboration between the Head and accounting services is vital to ensure the accounting reflects the company's strategy and adapts to changes.<br><br>Changes to the accounting policy are necessary due to external economic factors, legal changes, or the company's decision to alter accounting simplifications or adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The accounting policy also forms part of the annual financial statement introduction. In essence, a well-defined accounting policy organizes a company's operations, aids accounting services, and ensures the quality of financial reports, providing clarity to auditors and regulatory bodies.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_489" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_489" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_489" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_491" style="display:none;">Since 2021, Estonian CIT (Corporate Income Tax) has been an alternative tax regime for companies. Its core purpose is to provide a competitive and simple system that discourages tax abuse. While it has been in place for two years, its interpretation, particularly regarding "hidden profits," remains open. Recent individual tax interpretations offer guidance on what activities do not constitute hidden profits.<br><br>Eligible companies for Estonian CIT must primarily generate revenue from operational activities, employ staff beyond shareholders, operate as a capital company, and have a simple ownership structure (individuals only, no stakes in other entities). The tax is levied upon profit distribution, not income generation, fostering investment and improving liquidity. The tax base includes distributed profits, profits covering losses, and hidden profits.<br><br>Hidden profits are defined as any shareholder benefits beyond dividends, whether monetary or non-monetary, paid or unpaid, linked to the shareholder's right to profit participation. Such benefits trigger a tax liability. The classification of services provided by a shareholder to the company as hidden profits can be complex. While the law doesn't explicitly list such scenarios, a recent tax interpretation clarified that market-based transactions, like services rendered under cooperation agreements with civil liability for non-performance and independent of the company's financial status, are not considered hidden profits if they are not linked to the shareholder's right to profit participation. These interpretations, while not universally binding, provide valuable insight into tax authority practices.<br><br>The Estonian CIT has become popular for its potential tax cost reduction, with companies attracted by lower tax rates. However, ambiguities in certain concepts necessitate the use of individual tax interpretations for clarity on tax obligations and the practical application of tax laws.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_491" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_491" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_491" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_492" style="display:none;">Companies often express gratitude to employees or contractors through gifts or gift cards, funded from company operating funds or the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS). This can have tax implications. The source of funding impacts the tax treatment of gifts for employees. Gifts to employees from operating funds are generally considered income from employment, subject to income tax and social security contributions (ZUS), except for gifts of small value (under 100 PLN per year). Gifts funded from ZFŚS are tax-free up to 1000 PLN per year, above which they are taxable income but not subject to ZUS contributions. Employee benefits within a motivation system are treated as monetary equivalents, subject to income tax and ZUS.<br><br>Gift cards for employees and contractors are generally not considered tax-deductible expenses for the company, as they are viewed as donations. Gifts to business partners, lacking a promotional purpose, are also not deductible. Gifts received by B2B partners are treated as business income, with the partner responsible for taxes. VAT obligations may arise when giving gifts to contractors, unless they are of small value and related to the company's business. Companies were previously required to file PIT-8AR forms for gifts to contractors, but are now obligated to show the benefit in PIT-11. No declaration is needed for small-value gifts. Tax analysis of funding sources can lead to tax optimization for both employers and employees.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_492" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_492" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_492" style="display:none;"></p>

A good accountant helps the company navigate regulations, meets deadlines, optimizes taxes, and provides good reporting. While recruitment mishaps sometimes occur, they are quickly resolved. The author identifies two main paths to becoming a good accountant, both requiring a mentor. Theoretical knowledge alone is insufficient. A mentor provides experience, knowledge, and understands client expectations, guiding the mentee through various tasks and providing support.<br><br>The first path involves working in a specialized accounting firm, gaining experience in diverse tasks for multiple clients across various industries. This allows for rapid professional growth, especially when supplemented with training. These individuals often become chief accountants or financial directors due to their broad understanding of accounting principles and risk management. The second path involves working within the accounting department of a specific company, which provides in-depth industry knowledge but may limit exposure to a wide range of accounting challenges. Additional training can compensate for this.<br><br>Regardless of the path, a good accountant works efficiently and prioritizes tasks to meet management's needs. Soft skills, especially communication, are essential for building relationships with clients, managers, and colleagues. In conclusion, a career in accounting offers intellectual and communication challenges, leading to satisfaction and fulfillment, especially with the opportunity to become a certified auditor.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_494" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_494" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_494" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_498" style="display:none;">The National e-Invoice System (KSeF) is an integrated IT system for issuing, storing, and sending structured invoices. Optional since 2022 alongside paper and electronic invoices, it will become mandatory on July 1, 2024, according to the Ministry of Finance.<br><br>Active VAT taxpayers with a registered office or fixed place of business in Poland will be obligated to use KSeF. VAT-exempt entrepreneurs may also be required, but with a delayed implementation deadline of January 1, 2025.<br><br>KSeF primarily covers B2B sales transactions, excluding B2C documents like consumer invoices (replacing fiscal receipts with customer data but without a VAT number) and toll road tickets.<br><br>Businesses can prepare for KSeF using software provided by the Ministry of Finance or commercial alternatives. A test version is currently available on the Ministry's website.<br><br>Benefits of KSeF include faster VAT refunds (40 days instead of 60), standardized documentation, no need for taxpayers to store invoices, easier accounting, and exemption from sending JPK_FA files. KSeF also enables self-billing, allowing sellers to authorize buyers to issue invoices.<br><br>Failure to implement KSeF by July 1, 2024, may result in penalties, potentially up to 100% of the tax amount on the invoice, or 18.7% of the amount due if no tax is shown. However, the Ministry of Finance plans to postpone sanctions for errors until 2025.<br><br>KSeF aims to streamline invoicing, reducing the burden on businesses. Digitization offers benefits such as faster VAT refunds and eliminating the need for document storage. Early preparation is recommended to familiarize oneself with the system's functionalities and adapt to the changes.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_498" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_498" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_498" style="display:none;"></p>

Licensing involves the licensor transferring rights to intangible assets, specifically granting the licensee the right to use software for further exploitation, constituting a service.<br><br>Tax authorities have interpreted licensing differently over the years. Initially, it was often seen as a continuous service, with the tax obligation arising based on payment schedules. However, in 2017, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that a license, regardless of duration, is not a continuous service. Now, tax obligations are generally recognized based on standard principles. This is reinforced by individual interpretations, indicating an emerging consensus against classifying licenses as continuous services.<br><br>Under VAT law, the tax obligation arises upon service completion. If no invoice has been issued or partial payment made, the tax obligation and revenue recognition occur on the date of delivery of the object of the agreement. In the case of a license, it is the date of transfer, confirmed by both parties, often through a transfer protocol. If the license is conditional upon payment, the tax obligation arises upon receipt of that payment.<br><br>Regarding corporate income tax (CIT), revenue is generally recognized on the date of item delivery, asset disposal, or service performance, but no later than the date of invoice issuance or payment settlement. Thus, the revenue recognition moment is typically the date the license/software rights are transferred, confirmed by both parties.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_499" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_499" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_499" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_500" style="display:none;">Work on the law regarding family foundations is nearing completion, potentially enabling the establishment of the first family foundations in the first half of 2023. A family foundation manages a family business's assets, securing the wealth for designated individuals, usually family, and facilitating business succession. It aims to protect family business assets upon the owner's retirement or passing, ensure family harmony to prevent business disruption, ease succession, and prevent asset fragmentation, ensuring the continuity of the family enterprise.<br><br>Foundations can be established by multiple individuals, including non-relatives, and kinship between founder and beneficiary isn't required. Taxation is family-relationship based, often tax-neutral. PIT exemptions apply to benefits and assets acquired from the foundation by the founder, spouse, ancestors, descendants, siblings, stepchildren, stepparents, or stepmothers. Others pay 15% PIT. CIT exemption applies to revenue from specified business activities; otherwise, a 25% CIT rate applies. A 15% CIT is levied when distributing funds to beneficiaries upon the foundation's dissolution. Establishing and transferring assets to the foundation is exempt from CIT and PCC taxes.<br><br>Family foundations cannot utilize the Estonian CIT taxation model for companies in which they hold shares. Inheritances and donations received from the family foundation are subject to income tax on individuals and are not subject to inheritance or donation tax. It benefits those wanting to maintain a family business across generations, protect assets, and generate profits for beneficiaries' upkeep. Tax advantages exist for founders and beneficiaries, with PIT exemptions for close family members. Favorable CIT conditions are introduced, with specified business activities exempt. CIT is levied at 15% only upon distribution to beneficiaries.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_500" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_500" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_500" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_501" style="display:none;">Many entrepreneurs question the necessity of engaging with accounting firms and how to choose one. Remote work, document digitization, and automation have blurred geographical limitations. Shared service centers in Poland handle accounting for companies across the globe, proving that businesses of any size can be served remotely.<br><br>The price of accounting services depends on factors such as the type of business, accounting methods, document volume, business complexity, accounting system, and reporting requirements. Sole proprietorships using simplified accounting methods like a flat-rate tax are the simplest and cheapest, while corporations using full accounting books are more complex and expensive. The number and complexity of documents significantly affect the price, with high-volume, complex businesses incurring higher fees.<br><br>Business complexity, measured by the number of cost centers, reporting requirements, and the type of financial system used (SAP, Oracle, etc.), also drives costs. Automation and streamlined data transfer can reduce expenses, as human labor is the costliest. Ultimately, accounting firms sell their time, and clients can expect to pay from a few hundred to thousands of zlotys per month. While value-added services exist, clients often focus on hourly rates. Prestige, experience, customer service, and advice quality are also factored into the final price.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_501" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_501" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_501" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_504" style="display:none;">The amended Labor Code allows employers to conduct preventive alcohol testing of employees if it's necessary to protect the life, health, or property of employees or others. Employers decide if the testing is justified and define its scope in collective agreements, work regulations, or announcements, specifying the affected employee groups, testing methods, device type, timing, and frequency. Employees must be informed at least two weeks before testing begins, and new hires must be informed before starting work.<br><br>Testing involves non-laboratory methods using calibrated devices to determine alcohol presence. An alcohol concentration of 0.1 to 0.25 mg/dm3 in exhaled air is considered being after alcohol use, exceeding 0.25 mg/dm3 indicates intoxication. Testing must respect employee dignity. Positive test results or suspicion of intoxication prevent an employee from working, with notification provided. Employees can request a separate test by law enforcement if they disagree with the results.<br><br>Information about testing and positive results can be stored for up to one year, or longer if it's evidence in legal proceedings involving the employer. Reporting to work intoxicated or consuming alcohol at work can lead to fines, disciplinary action, or termination.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_505" style="display:none;">Lean management originated in the 1940s, inspired by post-World War II Japanese automotive industry practices, particularly at Toyota. John Krafcik coined the term "lean production" in the late 1980s, contrasting Toyota's production system with traditional mass production. Lean emphasizes eliminating waste ("muda"), synchronizing processes for "just-in-time" delivery, preventing errors ("poka-yoke"), and continuous improvement ("kaizen").<br><br>Lean thinking involves defining value, identifying the value stream, ensuring continuous flow, implementing a pull system (delivering services only when needed), and striving for excellence. This approach reduces costs, improves efficiency, and maximizes employee potential, ultimately enhancing competitiveness. Simulation games, like "Architeka," help employees understand and implement lean principles.<br><br>Moore Polska has embraced lean management to improve service delivery. Internal trainers use the "Architeka" game to educate employees about Lean Service, aiming to enhance process efficiency. Workshops have been conducted across Moore Polska's offices, training 120 employees. The company believes that lean management and a well-trained team lead to better client service. Modern organizations adopt lean principles to address challenges in a volatile business environment, as traditional methods are no longer sufficient. Moore Polska fosters this culture and positions itself as a partner that understands and utilizes processes effectively.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_505" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_505" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_505" style="display:none;"></p>

In today's dynamic world, it's often overlooked. People mistakenly believe that consistent hours equal balance, which is frequently an illusion. True harmony exists when we fully engage at work without dwelling on personal matters, and vice versa.<br><br>To nurture ourselves, grow, and enjoy life, time is crucial. Organizing it, dividing the day into personal and professional spheres, is key. Lists and schedules help categorize tasks, prioritizing the most important. Systematically addressing these tasks is vital. Self-control and responsibility boost motivation.

The sender of a message can inadvertently create communication noise, leading to misunderstandings.<br><br>Encoding is the process of translating information into a message, using symbols that represent concepts and meanings, which can take the form of words or gestures.

These factors can cause the same information to be conveyed differently by different people.<br><br>To improve communication, one must learn to "read" people and understand their perspective. When encoding messages, senders should use symbols that are familiar to the target audience. Effective encoding involves conveying information clearly and simply, and anticipating and eliminating potential misunderstandings.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_508" style="display:none;">Estonian CIT is gaining popularity, but taxpayers still have doubts about its practical application. One such area is the mixed use of company cars by employees, which is subject to varying interpretations by tax authorities and administrative courts. Currently, there isn't a unified legal precedent. Tax authorities often draw an analogy to hidden profits, suggesting that 50% of the expenses related to mixed-use cars should be treated as non-business expenses subject to CIT.<br><br>However, a ruling by the Provincial Administrative Court in Gdańsk offered a contrasting view, stating that companies under Estonian CIT don't need to pay tax on expenses from mixed-use cars, as long as the employee is not a shareholder. The court argued that without a specific law, there's no basis for taxation.<br><br>From January 1, 2023, an amendment to the CIT law clarifies this, stating that 50% of expenses related to cars not exclusively used for business purposes will be considered non-business expenses. While interpretation issues currently exist, the January 2023 amendment is expected to resolve them.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_508" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_508" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_508" style="display:none;"></p>

While many see job cuts as the solution, this article argues against it. Layoffs offer immediate financial gains but incur significant hidden costs. Employees are the driving force of a company, contributing intellect, ideas, and crucial client relationships. Losing staff disrupts teams, creates knowledge gaps, and fosters uncertainty, leading to decreased morale and potential departures of remaining employees. Furthermore, layoffs damage the employer's reputation, deterring future candidates. Rehiring involves substantial costs in recruitment, training, and onboarding, which are lost when employees leave prematurely. Instead of layoffs, employers should explore alternatives such as temporary salary reductions, reduced working hours, job reassignments, flexible work arrangements, unpaid leave agreements, or suspending non-essential perks. Prudent cost management in administrative purchases and supplier renegotiations can also yield savings. Experienced and stable staff are invaluable during economic downturns, as they prevent recruitment costs and ensure business continuity when the economy recovers.

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a law (Tarcza 1.0) introduced a suspension of administrative law deadlines. This caused significant legal debate regarding whether tax law was included and, if so, whether the suspension should benefit taxpayers exclusively, aligning with constitutional protections. The Supreme Administrative Court referred these critical interpretive questions to a 7-judge panel for a definitive ruling. Taxpayers await this clarification to understand the precise timing of their tax liability expirations. The outcome will be crucial for tax compliance and rights protection.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_510" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_510" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_510" style="display:none;"></p>

Section 1.4 of the guide states that the CIT Act's provisions do not exclude the application of all separate tax obligations, specifically mentioning transfer pricing and withholding tax.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_513" style="display:none;">The Non-financial Disclosure Reporting Directive (NFRD) was an early step towards non-financial reporting, requiring large public interest entities with over 500 employees to disclose information on environmental, social, and employee matters, human rights, anti-corruption, and bribery. This directive allowed for significant interpretation. In Poland, the NFRD was implemented through an amendment to the Accounting Act in 2016, affecting entities with over 500 employees and meeting specific asset or revenue thresholds. The first reporting year under these requirements in Poland was 2017.<br><br>Due to a lack of standardized rules and comparability issues with NFRD reports, the European Commission introduced the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in April 2021. The CSRD mandates several key reporting obligations for companies. These include conducting a materiality assessment based on a two-way materiality principle, preparing reports according to the unified European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), analyzing and including information on the company's alignment with the EU Taxonomy, presenting reports in XHTML format with proper tagging, and undergoing an audit by an independent, authorized entity. The CSRD aims to cover a broader range of entities than the NFRD. The development of the ESRS is being led by the EFRAG Project Task Force, with the standards comprising 13 documents covering general principles, cross-cutting indicators, environmental, social and governance matters. Auditors and other certified assurance service providers will verify these reports.<br><br>The Non-financial Disclosure Reporting Directive (NFRD) was an initial European Union directive requiring large public interest entities to report on non-financial matters like environmental, social, and employee issues, human rights, and corruption. While it laid the groundwork for such reporting, it offered considerable room for interpretation. Poland implemented NFRD through its Accounting Act, impacting companies exceeding specific employee and financial thresholds. The subsequent Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), introduced due to the NFRD's limitations in standardization and comparability, significantly expands these requirements. The CSRD mandates companies to conduct materiality assessments, report using the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), detail their alignment with the EU Taxonomy, use a standardized XHTML format, and have their reports audited. The ESRS, developed by EFRAG, cover a comprehensive range of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics. The CSRD aims for broader coverage and more rigorous, comparable reporting to enhance transparency in sustainability matters.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_513" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_513" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_513" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_514" style="display:none;">The Director of the National Revenue Information confirmed that a company that did not meet all the conditions for choosing Estonian CIT on the day of submitting the ZAW-RD notification did not effectively choose this form of taxation. Consequently, the company does not have to wait 3 years to resubmit the relevant notification.<br><br>This article highlights an individual interpretation from October 12, 2022, issued by the Director of the National Revenue Information (0111-KDIB1-1.4010.482.2022.1.AW), which addresses this specific issue.<br><br>The company stated it submitted the ZAW-RD notification to opt for the lump-sum corporate income tax regime, effective from April 1, 2022. Despite prior analysis of the eligibility criteria, professional advice revealed that not all conditions were met. The company is now working to adjust its business model to qualify for Estonian CIT.<br><br>The company questioned whether its ZAW-RD notification had any legal effect and if it was now free to resubmit the notification before the three-year penalty period expired.<br><br>The Director of KIS clarified that a company can effectively resubmit the ZAW-RD notification before the three-year period, which is a penalty for those who lose this tax option. Crucially, if a company did not meet all the necessary prerequisites for Estonian CIT at the time of submission or the intended start date, its notification was not effective, and thus it never acquired the right to this tax regime. Therefore, it can resubmit the ZAW-RD notification before the three-year sanction period has elapsed.<br><br>The key takeaway is that a company failing to meet the conditions for Estonian CIT when filing the ZAW-RD notification or on the intended start date does not lose the right to this tax regime because it never acquired it in the first place. This allows for the resubmission of the ZAW-RD notification before the three-year penalty period.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_514" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_514" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_514" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_515" style="display:none;">This article, following a previous one on ESG, discusses whether ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) represents an opportunity or a threat for financial market participants. It highlights that ESG implementation will bring significant changes, requiring reporting entities to acquire new competencies and tools. Audit committees and regulatory bodies like the Ministry of Finance and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority will also need ESG-trained personnel for effective oversight.<br><br>Globally, 75% of companies are reportedly unprepared for comprehensive ESG adoption. However, customer surveys indicate strong support for sustainable practices, with many willing to pay more for products from environmentally conscious companies. Ignoring ESG principles is deemed unprofitable, hindering growth and leading to stagnation for unadaptable organizations. Younger generations entering the workforce are particularly attuned to environmental issues, offering significant potential for driving ESG initiatives.<br><br>The financial market is responding to these shifts, with specialized companies like EcoVadis emerging to measure sustainability readiness through multi-dimensional ratings. Banks play a crucial role as capital providers, facing demands to collect, aggregate, and analyze sustainability data. This will likely lead to preferential financing for companies with strong ESG performance, particularly in green industries and those pursuing decarbonization. Ultimately, ESG is presented not as a threat but as a long-term opportunity for businesses, regulators, and citizens. Europe is investing heavily in transforming its economy, with substantial EU funds and financial sector capital allocated for this purpose. Adapting to ESG requirements is crucial for success, with unpreparedness posing regulatory and reputational risks.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_515" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_515" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_515" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_516" style="display:none;">Banks on the defensive. Courts rule that borrowers do not have to repay franc loans when the bank set the franc exchange rate.<br><br>Polish courts are increasingly issuing rulings favorable to individuals who took out Swiss franc loans. The reason? Banks unfairly set franc exchange rates for repayment purposes. According to the courts, such agreements are invalid. As a result, borrowers can demand the refund of paid installments and do not have to pay banks additional remuneration for using the granted credit.<br><br>In one such case, the District Court for Warsaw-Śródmieście asked the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) whether, if an agreement made the repayment of a franc loan dependent on the bank's consent, the court could independently remove such a provision. Banks argued that this would render the rest of the agreement valid, meaning the borrower could continue repaying the loan, but at official exchange rates set by the National Bank of Poland.<br><br>The CJEU has taken a clear stance, maintaining its pro-consumer approach in franc loan cases. It ruled that courts cannot remove clauses from loan agreements that require the bank's consent for repayment at unfair exchange rates and simultaneously automatically introduce an obligation to repay at official NBP exchange rates. Such a solution would impose no penalty on banks for using unfair clauses and would excessively interfere with the contract's terms.<br><br>Furthermore, the CJEU established that the statute of limitations for consumers' financial claims against banks should be calculated from the moment the consumer becomes aware that the agreement or its specific terms are unfair.<br><br>However, some issues remain unresolved. One such issue is the banks' right to remuneration for borrowers' use of borrowed money. While courts mostly deny banks this additional remuneration, the CJEU is currently considering this matter, with a ruling expected in 2023.<br><br>Banks are facing increased pressure from legal challenges to Swiss franc loans due to unfair exchange rate practices. Polish courts are siding with borrowers, often declaring loan agreements invalid. The CJEU has reinforced this pro-consumer stance, ruling that unfair clauses cannot be simply removed and replaced with official exchange rates without penalizing the banks. The calculation of the statute of limitations for claims has also been clarified to begin when the consumer realizes the unfairness of the terms. A key outstanding issue concerns banks' entitlement to remuneration for the use of funds when loans are deemed invalid, a matter the CJEU is currently reviewing.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_516" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_516" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_516" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_517" style="display:none;">The 21st century has presented significant financial challenges, including the pandemic, disrupted supply chains, the conflict in Ukraine, and rampant inflation. Alongside these, profound changes in corporate reporting are occurring.<br><br>The business world is increasingly prioritizing non-financial aspects, particularly sustainability, encapsulated by ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance). While financial reporting has a long history, non-financial reporting is relatively new, indicating substantial room for development. The European Union is driving a significant shift, treating ESG reporting as a "tsunami" in corporate reporting systems, with the aim of aligning it with financial reporting. Poland, like other member states, is mandated to implement these changes, with new directives shaping future sustainable reporting.<br><br>In Poland, ESG reporting will be phased in, initially focusing on public trust entities, specifically those listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange employing over 500 staff. Eventually, it will encompass all public trust entities and those operating outside the EU. Standards are being developed by EFRAG.<br><br>The digital format is the intended publication method for ESG reports, to be included alongside financial statements and management reports. The initial publication period under these sustainability requirements is planned for January 1, 2024, with audits occurring in 2025 for the 2024 period. Similar to financial data, ESG reports will be subject to auditor examination, receiving an opinion with the same level of assurance as financial statements. Ethical and independence principles will apply to both financial and non-financial data.<br><br>ESG attestation services will be based on Standard 3000, akin to ESEF. Professionals will require training and specialization. The European Commission is expected to issue guidelines by January 1, 2026. Internal auditors may also gain approval powers for ESG reporting. Currently, Poland faces "greenwashing," where companies misuse ESG reports for marketing. The future impact of ESG remains to be seen, but expectations are high.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_517" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_517" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_517" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_518" style="display:none;">According to amendments to the Personal Income Tax and Corporate Income Tax laws effective January 1, 2022, depreciation is no longer allowed for residential buildings (including elevators), separate residential properties, cooperative ownership rights to apartments, and rights to single-family homes in housing cooperatives, if used for business or leased. However, a transitional provision allows taxpayers to deduct depreciation expenses for these assets if they were acquired or manufactured before January 1, 2022, but only until December 31, 2022.<br><br>A residential building purchased in January 2022 cannot be depreciated. If acquired in 2021, depreciation can be deducted until the end of 2022, but not after. This change has raised concerns about violating the principle of protecting acquired rights. Taxpayers argue for continued depreciation until full amortization, based on constitutional principles. Tax authorities disagree, deeming this position incorrect in individual interpretations.<br><br>Administrative courts align with tax authorities. A non-final ruling by the Provincial Administrative Court in Łódź (September 20, 2022) stated that an individual tax interpretation procedure cannot be used to challenge the compliance of tax regulations with the Constitution. Tax authorities lack the jurisdiction to assess constitutional compliance. Therefore, the court agreed that depreciation of residential properties purchased before January 1, 2022, can only be deducted until December 31, 2022, not until fully amortized. Neither the tax authority nor the Administrative Court can invalidate a law due to potential constitutional violations. This stance confirms the impossibility of disregarding the legal provision based on potential constitutional infringements.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_518" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_518" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_518" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_519" style="display:none;">Following the outbreak of war in Ukraine, many Ukrainian citizens have emigrated to Poland. A significant number of these individuals are approaching or have already exceeded the 183-day period of stay in Poland. Some refugees continue to work for their previous Ukrainian employers. This raises the question of whether these individuals are obligated to pay Polish income tax.<br><br>The Polish Personal Income Tax (PIT) Act, specifically Article 3(1) and 1a(2), states that individuals residing in Poland are subject to unlimited tax liability on all their income, regardless of where it was earned. Residence is established if a person stays in Poland for over 183 days in a tax year. However, these provisions are subject to double taxation avoidance treaties.<br><br>According to Article 15(2) of the double taxation treaty with Ukraine, remuneration earned by a resident of one contracting state from employment exercised in another contracting state is taxable only in the first state if: (a) the recipient stays in the second state for no more than 183 days in a calendar year, (b) the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in the second state, and (c) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment of the employer in the second state.<br><br>Therefore, if a Ukrainian citizen stays in Poland for over 183 days and earns income from employment for a Ukrainian employer not having a seat in Poland, this income is fully taxable in Poland. While some experts suggest that the 183-day period should be suspended due to the war preventing return to Ukraine, this interpretation lacks legal basis and could have adverse consequences.<br><br>According to Article 44(1a)(1) and (3a) of the PIT Act, taxpayers receiving income from abroad without an intermediary are obliged to pay advance tax payments themselves. These payments are due by the 20th of the month following the income receipt, applying the lowest tax rate. The entire income earned during the stay in Poland must be declared.<br><br>In essence, if a Ukrainian citizen has resided in Poland for over 183 days and works remotely for a Ukrainian employer, they are liable for Polish income tax on that income. They must proactively pay advance tax payments and declare all income earned in Poland.<br><br>In summary, Ukrainian citizens residing in Poland for over 183 days and working for Ukrainian employers are subject to Polish income tax on their earnings, according to Polish law and the double taxation treaty with Ukraine. While the ongoing conflict may impede return to Ukraine, a strict interpretation of the 183-day rule means that income earned during this period in Poland is taxable locally. Taxpayers are obligated to make advance tax payments and declare all income received in Poland. Failure to do so may result in adverse consequences.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_519" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_519" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_519" style="display:none;"></p>

A draft amendment to the special act on aid for Ukrainian citizens, concerning their stay in Poland due to the armed conflict, is planned to be submitted to parliament.<br><br>Current regulations allowed Ukrainians to apply for temporary residence permits, with applications expected by the end of November. These permits would have had a simplified procedure compared to those issued under general immigration laws. However, the Ministry of Interior and Administration has decided to abandon this solution.<br><br>The decision stems from the immense influx of Ukrainian citizens into Poland since February 24, 2022. As of September 28, 2022, approximately 1.3 million PESEL numbers were issued to Ukrainians. The ministry explained that even with maximum procedural simplifications and automation, provincial governors would be unable to efficiently process the vast number of applications for simplified temporary residence permits. The increasing number of applications from other foreigners, including Ukrainians not covered by the special act, also presents a significant challenge for provincial offices.<br><br>The Diia.pl digital identity document, accessible via a mobile app after obtaining a PESEL number and activating a trusted profile, is recognized within the EU. It allows holders, along with a travel document, to cross Schengen borders multiple times and stay in Schengen states. The proposed amendment will legally define Diia.pl as a residence document under the Schengen Borders Code.<br><br>Further changes include extending the validity of national visas, Schengen visas issued by Polish or other Schengen authorities, and temporary residence permits for Ukrainians until August 24, 2023, if their permitted stay was set to expire from February 24, 2022. Currently, these documents are automatically extended until December 31, 2022.<br><br>Ukrainians conducting business in Poland will also benefit from an extension until August 24, 2023, for exemptions from specific requirements related to business permits. Legally residing Ukrainians can conduct business on equal terms with Poles and are currently exempt from demonstrating income, employing Polish citizens, or proving future financial capacity, unlike other foreigners applying for business residence permits.<br><br>A new provision in the draft amendment introduces the possibility of granting a one-year temporary residence permit to Ukrainians who do not meet standard requirements due to their declared purpose of stay or circumstances that do not justify a stay longer than three months, or if grounds for refusal exist other than those specified in the law.<br><br>The amendment will also repeal certain provisions of the COVID-19 act related to the automatic extension of visa and residence permit validity. This will impact foreigners, primarily non-Ukrainians, whose documents extended due to the pandemic have expired. They must urgently apply for legal status in Poland.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>Poland is discontinuing its plan for simplified temporary residence permits for Ukrainian citizens due to the overwhelming number of applications. The government is extending the validity of existing visas and residence permits for Ukrainians until August 24, 2023. The digital Diia.pl document will be legally recognized as a residence permit for travel within the Schengen area. Ukrainians engaged in business will retain exemptions from certain permit requirements until August 24, 2023. A new provision allows for one-year temporary residence permits for Ukrainians who don't meet standard criteria. The changes also repeal COVID-19-related extensions for other foreigners, who are urged to legalize their stay promptly.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_520" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_520" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_520" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_521" style="display:none;">On September 29, 2022, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a controversial ruling in the Raiffeisen Leasing v. Republic of Slovenia case (C-235/21). The case concerned whether a written agreement, in the absence of a formal invoice, could be considered an invoice under Article 203 of Directive 2006/112/EC.<br><br>The CJEU ruled that a disposal and sale-and-leaseback agreement, if it contains the VAT rate and all information necessary for tax authorities to determine if the conditions for VAT deduction are met, can be treated as an invoice. This ruling is controversial because it suggests a potentially informal approach to VAT invoicing requirements. Experts worry this could lead to practical issues, such as businesses inadvertently issuing "empty invoices" if a subsequent formal invoice is issued, potentially leading to double VAT payment and criminal liability.<br><br>The ruling also raises concerns for buyers regarding VAT deductibility when agreements might be treated as invoices. Furthermore, it creates ambiguity on how to correct such "invoices" and how they would integrate with the upcoming Krajowy System e-Faktur (National e-Invoice System) in Poland. While Polish tax practice has sometimes diverged from CJEU rulings, businesses are advised to assess their agreements carefully.<br><br>This ruling allows a written agreement to be considered an invoice if it includes the VAT rate and sufficient details for tax authorities to verify VAT deduction rights. This departure from traditional invoicing practices is seen as potentially problematic and could create uncertainty for businesses and tax authorities regarding VAT obligations, invoice correction, and system integration. The controversy stems from the perceived over-informal approach and the potential for misinterpretation, leading to significant practical challenges and legal ambiguities for taxpayers and tax administrations alike.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_521" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_521" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_521" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_522" style="display:none;">Implementing ESG concept standards is a long-term process that yields benefits across multiple levels. Modern companies focused on continuous development and professional service quality readily adopt new, often mandatory, standards into their corporate policy, viewing them as valuable rather than burdensome necessities.<br><br>What is ESG?<br>Modern businesses increasingly integrate sustainable and responsible development solutions. Pressure from regulators, investors, lenders, employees, and consumers significantly influences their actions. ESG, an evolution from CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), incorporates financial factors, focusing on environmental, social, and corporate governance. While CSR primarily addressed sustainable development, it often served as a marketing strategy, lacking the comprehensive value that ESG now provides.<br><br>The ESG acronym stands for Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance. Companies prioritizing customer care, partnerships, sustainability, and responsible business should focus on all key ESG criteria.<br><br>The three pillars of ESG:<br><br>Environmental: This pillar encompasses actions supporting environmental protection and climate change mitigation, including energy efficiency, waste management, emissions reduction, renewable energy investment, and adherence to environmental regulations.<br><br>Social: This pillar covers social responsibility and human rights, addressing internal and external company matters. Internally, it includes equal pay, employee rights, human rights respect, promoting diversity and inclusion, data security, and transparent communication. Externally, it involves investing in employee development through training and volunteering, knowledge sharing, and nurturing customer relationships.<br><br>Corporate Governance: This pillar includes board structure, shareholder rights, executive compensation, tax transparency, and anti-corruption measures. These elements are crucial for building trust with long-term investors and business partners.<br><br>ESG's impact on employee motivation and recruitment:<br>Today's employees seek reliable employers who acknowledge global changes. A well-planned ESG strategy positively impacts current and future employees, reducing turnover and boosting engagement by fostering a sense of purpose and identification with company values. Companies investing in employee development are perceived as authentic and aware of their human capital's potential, actively listening to and implementing employee ideas.<br><br>In the competitive talent market, ESG is a powerful recruitment tool. Millennials and Gen Z, in particular, prioritize environmental concerns, equality, pay transparency, and non-discrimination. Studies show ESG-adopting firms experience twice the employment growth of those that do not prioritize it. Fulfilling ESG objectives related to equality, governance, community support, and environmental protection significantly influences job choices and candidate applications.<br><br>Moore Polska integrates all ESG strategy pillars into its company policy.<br><br>ESG – A Path to Success:<br>Building a business strategy around ESG should be viewed not as an obligation but as a long-term path to success in company development, talent recruitment, securing financing, and enhancing the company's reputation among clients and partners. Embracing ESG values allows medium-sized enterprises to be perceived as responsible, engaged, and attractive employers and business partners in a rapidly changing world.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_522" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_522" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_522" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_523" style="display:none;">Trust is more than a dictionary definition; it's an evolving process, not just believing someone's words or skills. In business, this is "trust management." Success hinges on trust, making it vital for leaders to build teams on trustworthy individuals who trust each other. Granting trust often leads to greater employee engagement, while constant control and visible doubt can demotivate teams.<br><br>Effective trust management involves recognizing risks and strategically building trust, which doesn't mean neglecting a team. A good leader stays informed and fosters an environment where employees feel comfortable asking for help. Credibility starts at the top; leaders must earn their team's trust by being reliable experts with a human touch, fostering cohesion and job satisfaction.<br><br>Stephen Covey emphasized that trust, or its absence, significantly impacts business, industry, education, and administration outcomes. Leaders must empower their subordinates to avoid stagnation, and trusting one's team signifies psychological maturity. This maturity allows for setting higher goals and shared responsibility.<br><br>Business is fundamentally about relationships built on trust, dialogue, and empathy, not just data. Trust means being both sincere and professional. Dale Carnegie advised respecting others' views and offering genuine praise to inspire willingness, advocating for authority based on trust rather than tyranny. Building such trust is key to finding reliable business partners.<br><br>Trust is foundational for successful leadership and business operations. Leaders who cultivate trust foster higher employee engagement, productivity, and overall satisfaction. This approach, rooted in credibility, expertise, and open communication, creates a more cohesive and effective team. It's a strategic imperative for achieving organizational goals and building lasting relationships. Trust empowers individuals and teams, leading to greater autonomy and a willingness to take on challenges, ultimately driving success.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_523" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_523" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_523" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_524" style="display:none;">Starting January 1, 2023, a new version of the PIT-2 form will be implemented in Poland, significantly expanding its scope and functionality. Previously, only employees on standard employment contracts submitted PIT-2 declarations, primarily to inform about other income sources that might affect their tax-reducing amount. This new PIT-2 (version 9) aligns with changes introduced by the "Polski Ład" and "Polski Ład 2.0" legislation.<br><br>The updated form will be accessible not only to employees but also to individuals earning income from other sources, such as civil law contracts (umowa zlecenia, umowa o dzieło), management contracts, and board positions. A key change is the ability to divide the tax-reducing amount across multiple income sources, up to three, proportionally. This benefits lower-income earners who previously couldn't fully utilize this reduction. Furthermore, the new PIT-2 consolidates several previously separate declarations into a single document. These include statements regarding joint taxation with a spouse, preferential tax treatment for single parents, increased tax-deductible costs, specific tax reliefs (for returnees, families with 4+ children, working seniors), waiving certain reliefs or 50% deductible costs, and requesting no tax advance payments if the tax-free allowance isn't exceeded. Previously submitted PIT-2 forms remain valid.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_524" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_524" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_524" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_525" style="display:none;">New regulations for employing foreigners in Poland are expected, with some changes potentially taking effect as early as October. A new act will replace existing provisions concerning foreign employment, aiming to streamline procedures, reduce abuse, and fully digitize processes. Key improvements include the elimination of the "labor market test," which previously required employers to prove no local candidates were available. This will simplify and expedite legalization by several weeks. Furthermore, all procedures for obtaining work permits and declarations of work assignment will be digitized, accessible solely through the praca.gov.pl portal. Employers will also be able to modify existing work permits instead of obtaining new ones when a foreigner's job conditions change.<br><br>Penalties for illegal employment will be revised, with fines calculated proportionally to the number of illegally employed foreigners, starting at a minimum of 500 PLN per person. This aims to make penalties more impactful for employers hiring multiple undocumented workers. However, some changes may increase costs for employers, such as a minimum employment requirement of one-quarter of a full-time position or 10 hours weekly for work permits. Annual permits will be issued for businesses operating for less than a year, foreigners working part-time (up to half-time or 20 hours weekly), or those employed under civil law contracts. The Council of Ministers may also introduce employment quotas through separate regulations.<br><br>Crucially, Russia will be removed from the list of countries whose citizens can work under simplified procedures by October. Russian citizens will now require work permits, which can take months to obtain, unlike the current swift declaration process.<br><br>Moore Polska offers assistance with the legalization of stay and work for foreigners in Poland.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_525" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_525" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_525" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_526" style="display:none;">Payroll accuracy is a critical concern for employees, especially following the implementation of "Polski Ład," a significant tax reform. The year 2022 saw numerous, often complex, legislative changes impacting payroll calculations, introduced amidst uncertainty and further modified by subsequent regulations and amendments.<br><br>Key changes included the introduction and subsequent withdrawal of a middle-class tax relief, the removal of deductions for health insurance contributions from taxes, and the postponement and eventual discontinuation of "advance tax deferral" (roling zaliczek). New tax exemptions for returning workers, seniors, and large families were introduced alongside a revised tax scale and a new monthly tax deduction. Health insurance obligations were extended to individuals appointed to positions, and changes were made to lump-sum allowances for company car private use, the mandatory application of tax reductions, and minimum wage rates.<br><br>These revolutionary and dynamic changes necessitated a thorough review of payroll calculations to ensure accuracy and prevent errors. Correctly calculated payroll and the elimination of potential mistakes are vital for building employee trust and enhancing a company's image. Companies struggling with payroll processing after "Polski Ład" are encouraged to seek professional verification services.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_526" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_526" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_526" style="display:none;"></p>

Consequently, the maximum rates for real estate tax will increase by 11.8%, a significant rise compared to last year's 3.6% increase.<br><br>On July 28, 2022, the Minister of Finance published a notice regarding the upper limits of flat-rate local taxes and fees for 2023. Examples of maximum rate increases include:<br><br>*   Land used for business activities: from PLN 1.03 to PLN 1.16 per square meter.<br>*   Residential buildings: from PLN 0.89 to PLN 1.00 per square meter of usable floor area.<br>*   Buildings used for business activities: from PLN 25.74 to PLN 28.78 per square meter of usable floor area.<br><br>It is important to note that these are maximum rates, which can be lowered by municipal councils. However, some municipalities, such as Gdańsk and Warsaw, have previously set their rates at the maximum level.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_531" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_531" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_531" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_532" style="display:none;">A new government bill published on August 25, 2022, proposes to repeal regulations from January 1, 2021, which extended transfer pricing documentation requirements to indirect tax haven transactions.<br><br>Previously, transfer pricing documentation was mainly associated with large-scale transactions between related entities. However, the scope was broadened to include smaller value transactions with unrelated entities. The obligation could arise if the beneficial owner of payments made to a counterparty was located in a tax-harmful jurisdiction, even indirectly through a counterparty's dealings. Such indirect "tax haven" transactions, if homogeneous and exceeding PLN 500,000 annually with a single counterparty, could trigger full local documentation requirements, including comparability analyses.<br><br>To mitigate these expanding obligations, taxpayers were advised to implement internal processes for verifying transactions and counterparties. The proposed bill aims to revert this, removing the documentation burden for indirect tax haven transactions. The article offers assistance with identifying reportable transactions, preparing required statements from counterparties, and compiling transfer pricing documentation for related-party and direct tax haven transactions, as well as developing procedures for identifying such obligations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_532" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_532" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_532" style="display:none;"></p>

This standard establishes the principles for determining, recognizing, and presenting revenue from the sale of goods in financial statements. Its primary objective is to define the accounting rules for recognizing, measuring, presenting, and disclosing revenue from sales of these items, as well as associated costs incurred to conclude and fulfill sales agreements.<br><br>KSR No. 15 is applicable for financial statements prepared for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, though earlier adoption is permitted. The standard addresses crucial aspects such as the conditions for recognizing revenue, valuing variable consideration, accounting for contract modifications, identifying the transfer of risks and benefits, demonstrating the probability of economic benefits, detailing elements in multi-element contracts, defining the roles of participating entities (agent vs. principal), handling sales under special conditions (e.g., consignment, conditional sales, deferred delivery, promotional sales, barter, repurchase agreements), reducing revenue (returns, discounts, rebates, price adjustments, grants), and the presentation and disclosure of revenue information in financial reports.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_535" style="display:none;">Approve means to consider something good, right, or worthy of support. It also expresses consent and acceptance. Approval, or praise, is a secret yet readily available, powerful weapon in the hands of every good leader.<br><br>We all desire approval. It is crucial to distinguish the normal human desire to be appreciated and noticed from an unhealthy need for approval, which psychologist Albert Ellis places at the pinnacle of irrational beliefs. Constantly seeking everyone's approval leads to mental and emotional discomfort because it's unattainable; there will always be someone who disagrees.<br><br>Professional approval, however, is different. Although people thrive when appreciated, they often deny this to others, resorting to coldness, indifference, or unnecessary criticism. The truth is, praise has a greater impact on development than constructive criticism.<br><br>A good leader praises others. Fear, uncertainty, and a focus on punishment without rewards are common but ineffective leadership styles. The best, though more difficult, approach is to acknowledge and praise every small progress a team member makes. This shows they are seen and valued, motivating them to do more and better, ultimately benefiting the team and the entire company.<br><br>Why approval at work is so important: Regardless of our position, we like our work to be recognized and acknowledged. A good leader understands that praising their team fosters their development. Silence, indifference, or constant criticism can make a team feel their work is meaningless, leading to a decline in effort. Focusing on positive outcomes boosts morale, encouraging employees to perform willingly. By minimizing criticism and utilizing praise, positive reactions are fostered and developed, while negative ones fade due to lack of attention.<br><br>A good leader remembers that shouting, unwarranted criticism, or instilling fear makes their team less productive, unhappy, and disinclined to perform their duties. Conversely, approval is a powerful tool. Every manager must aim for progress and understand their team, remembering their own past experiences as employees.<br><br>In summary, genuine approval and praise are potent tools for effective leadership. While the need for approval is a natural human desire, an unhealthy obsession with it is detrimental. In professional settings, acknowledging and celebrating even minor achievements significantly boosts morale and productivity, proving more impactful than criticism. Leaders who foster an environment of appreciation, rather than fear or negativity, create motivated and high-performing teams, ultimately benefiting the entire organization. This approach encourages positive behaviors and employee growth, leading to better overall results and a more positive work environment.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_535" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_535" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_535" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_536" style="display:none;">According to the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act, a real estate company is defined as an entity other than a natural person, obliged to prepare a balance sheet under accounting regulations, where specific conditions are met. These conditions differ for entities commencing business activities and those already operating. If an entity fails to meet any of these presented conditions, it cannot be recognized as a real estate company.<br><br>Practically, determining this status often leads to numerous doubts, primarily stemming from difficulties in correctly interpreting the relevant provisions of the Act. Consequently, tax authorities issue tax interpretations to assist taxpayers in establishing their real estate company status. A notable interpretation (sygn. 0111-KDIB1-1.4010.523.2021.2.AW dated May 6, 2022) clarified that when assessing the balance sheet value of real estate, both tangible assets and current assets (products, inventory) should be considered. Furthermore, when determining if the 60% revenue threshold from rental or subletting is met, revenue derived from properties involved in development activities must also be included. For further details, please contact us.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>The CIT Act defines a real estate company based on accounting obligations and specific revenue thresholds from property. Entities must correctly interpret these criteria, as ambiguities often arise. Tax authorities provide interpretative rulings to clarify this status. A key interpretation highlights that when calculating a real estate company's asset value, both tangible and current assets are relevant. Additionally, revenue from properties involved in development activities should be counted towards the rental income threshold. This clarifies the conditions for a company to be classified as a real estate company under Polish tax law, impacting its tax obligations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_536" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_536" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_536" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_539" style="display:none;">Persuasion is a method of influencing others, aiming to gain interest and approval for one's arguments. It is an art designed to evoke specific, intended reactions. A rational approach is fundamental, especially when dealing with complex topics or potential counterarguments. Relying on verified data, logical reasoning, and rational analysis is always best. When trying to change someone's opinion, these tools are essential, not to belittle their knowledge, but to support your own points, making it easier to guide their thinking.<br><br>However, data must be presented thoughtfully, sourced from reliable origins, avoiding unverified information or fake news for the sake of statistical weight. Truthfulness and conciseness are key; even a hint of falsehood or hesitation will be noticed. It's crucial to avoid a patronizing tone; the manner of speaking is as important as the factual basis. Respectful engagement with the listener, acknowledging their opinions even when different, is vital. Maintaining composure, even when faced with challenging questions, is essential, as these can be opportunities for discussion and learning. Avoid succumbing to emotions.<br><br>The tone of voice matters; mumbling or shouting is ineffective. A confident, convicted tone, without arrogance, is persuasive. Balanced word choice is a key to success. Body language is equally important; avoid being overly stiff or animated. Naturalness is foundational; artificiality will be perceived negatively. Free and easy communication fosters a relaxed atmosphere, making the listener more receptive and breaking down barriers.<br><br>The art of persuasion isn't about long-winded or convoluted speech. Overly elaborate language can obscure the main point and bore the listener, leading to misunderstanding. Simple, clear communication is most effective. Structuring arguments logically, starting with a general overview and gradually moving to specifics, prevents overwhelming the audience and clarifies the discussion's purpose. Avoid creating uncertainty or negative feelings. Instead, foster sympathy, tolerance, and courtesy to open doors for persuasion. This skill is invaluable not only in leadership but also in business conversations and negotiations.<br><br>Persuasion is the art of influencing others by gaining their interest and approval for your arguments.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_540" style="display:none;">Recording operations within a closed cost circle, in correspondence with other accounts in that circle, means the change in product inventory recorded on accounts of the Cost (Group 6) equals the balance of account 49 (Cost Settlement). However, many operations can cause entries into or exits from this cost circle. Analysis of these movements primarily focuses on operations recorded on Group 6 accounts in conjunction with accounts outside the circle, such as Groups 0, 1, 2, 3, and Group 7 accounts (excluding the cost of goods sold).<br><br>Examples of such transactions on Group 6 accounts include releasing finished products for lab testing, promotional events, identifying inventory shortages or surpluses, transfers to a company store's inventory, use in fixed asset production, value write-downs, and donations of finished goods.<br><br>However, analyzing changes in product inventory should not be limited to Group 6 accounts. The closed cost circle also includes Group 5 accounts (Costs by Activity Type), account 70-1 (Cost of Goods Sold), and account 49 (Cost Settlement). Therefore, movements in and out of these accounts can also disrupt the balance within the closed cost circle.<br><br>Examples of deviations within Group 5 involve resolving or establishing provisions for employee benefits or warranties, providing gratuitous services, or undertaking fixed asset construction by primary or auxiliary activities. For account 490, deviations can include settling insurance costs or establishing/resolving provisions for employee benefits or warranties.<br><br>Importantly, changes in product inventory should not be affected by deferred costs unrelated to core operations, like financial commissions settled over time.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_540" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_540" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_540" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_541" style="display:none;">The legislative process for these changes is ongoing, and updates will be provided as significant developments occur.<br><br>Key amendments to the Corporate Income Tax Act include the repeal of "hidden dividend" provisions, which were designed to prevent profit distribution disguised as deductible expenses, such as gratuitous asset use or interest-free loans to shareholders.<br><br>A proposed suspension of the minimum income tax is planned until December 31, 2022. Future modifications to this tax include raising the profitability threshold from 1% to 2% and adjusting its calculation by excluding specific costs like leasing fees, salary and social security increases, energy cost increases, and excise tax.<br><br>The project also aims to simplify the building income tax refund process by eliminating the need for formal decisions when refund amounts are clear.<br><br>Documentation requirements for transactions with offshore entities (TP) will be adjusted, notably by increasing the materiality threshold for direct transactions to PLN 500,000 annually. The scope of documentation will be clarified, focusing on the beneficial owner of the income. The presumption of beneficial owner residency in tax havens will be abolished.<br><br>For Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFC), regulations will be introduced to prevent double taxation on dividends paid between CFCs within the same holding structure, and the definition of a subsidiary will be refined.<br><br>Holding company rules are being clarified, including a revised definition of a holding company that removes the tax exemption condition and expands its scope to include simple joint-stock companies. A 95% dividend tax exemption will become a full 100% exemption.<br><br>Clarifications for the lump-sum corporate income tax (Estonian CIT) will address non-business expenses, the burden of proof for business asset use, the expiry of tax liability after four tax years, and the deadline for tax returns and payments. Payment deadlines for various income distributions will also be extended.<br><br>Changes to the "enveloped profit tax" will include defining deductible expenses and clarifying the conditions for its application to counteract tax avoidance through transfers to low-tax jurisdictions.<br><br>Withholding tax rules will see a relaxation of the "pay and refund" mechanism, with some payer obligations regarding interest and discount on government securities being repealed. Exemptions for non-residents will be expanded, and the deadline for submitting payer declarations regarding preferential treatment conditions will be extended to the end of the tax year.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_541" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_541" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_541" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_546" style="display:none;">This article addresses changes in Polish tax law concerning company reorganizations, specifically focusing on the impact of the "Polish Deal" amendments to the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act. The key question is the tax implications of a second reorganization.<br><br>The article explains that while EU Directive 2009/133/WE generally ensures tax neutrality for mergers, divisions, and share exchanges, the Polish amendments introduce new conditions. The Ministry of Finance argues these changes aim to prevent indefinite tax deferral and ensure continuity in tax valuations.<br><br>Specific conditions for tax neutrality in share exchanges include verifying if the shareholder is a CIT taxpayer, if contributed shares are for capital increase, if the shares were acquired for the first time (not through prior reorganizations), and crucially, if the tax valuation of acquired shares continues the valuation of the restructured assets. Failure to meet these conditions results in taxation.<br><br>Similar conditions apply to company mergers and divisions. The tax neutrality hinges on shares not being previously acquired via share exchanges or other reorganizations and the tax valuation of new shares not exceeding the prior tax valuation of the original shares, ensuring continuity of asset valuation.<br><br>Changes also affect contributions of businesses or organized parts of businesses (ZCP). Tax neutrality for such contributions is maintained only if the recipient company adopts the tax book values of the assets from the contributing entity. The burden of proof for these conditions rests with the taxpayer. The amendments, effective from January 1, 2022, lack transitional provisions, requiring immediate application and potential re-evaluation of past transactions. Tax neutrality is largely determined by the method of acquiring shares involved in the reorganization.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_546" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_546" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_546" style="display:none;"></p>

Several tax preferences expired at the end of May 2022.

Specifically, the exemption for general welfare fund payments increased to PLN 2,000, while exemptions for assistance due to random events, natural disasters, long-term illness, or death were raised to PLN 10,000, and other welfare payments to PLN 3,000.

By respecting another person, you cannot judge them. Everyone has the right to be themselves and to express their own opinion, provided they do so in a cultured and balanced manner. Gender, position, or circumstances are irrelevant here.<br><br>What if several people at work have different opinions? How to behave so that appropriate business steps are taken despite a lack of agreement? What to do so that a person whose opinion you disagree with feels that, regardless of your own opinion, you respect their words?<br><br>Empathy is the key to respect. Empathetic people cannot intentionally hurt another person; they understand others' feelings and know how to support them. These are undoubtedly skills a good leader should possess. Empathy is also the foundation of respect – it allows for a better understanding of the interlocutor's position and easier acceptance when it differs from our own. Respect is the key to avoiding arguments, and you can find an article about it HERE.<br><br>A good leader must remember that the employee is at the center of the value system, and therefore, must also take care to show them respect, even if they are not always right. Example always flows from the top. Thus, a good leader must possess appropriate character traits to better understand the behavior of people around them. They must, of course, be reasonable but also cannot close themselves off to others' opinions, especially when they differ from their own reasoning.<br><br>Be like Socrates. Never show your interlocutor that you start a discussion eager to prove your point at all costs. Also, remember to control your emotions. Do not try to imply that "you are smarter" or "you will confirm your thesis at all costs." First, ask yourself if you are truly 100% sure you are right – it rarely happens. Allegedly, Theodore Roosevelt humbly assured that if he were right 75% of the time, he couldn't expect anything more. It is worth noting that this was said by one of the most enlightened minds of the 20th century.<br><br>Dale Carnegie, in his book "How to Win Friends and Influence People," goes a step further, saying that if we were right 55% of the time, we could safely invest in the stock market and earn millions. However, if you are not even 55% sure, why are you able to tell someone they are wrong? So, don't be afraid of hesitations in your statements – "it seems to me," "I have a feeling," "if I'm wrong, correct me." This is not a sign of weakness. Such an introduction will defuse tension, open a broader scope for discussion, and inspire the interlocutor to approach the discussion with equal respect. You will avoid arguments, and perhaps even make someone admit they are wrong, given that the other side openly mentions such a possibility.<br><br>Respect in business.

The forgiven subsidy is classified as income from other sources, not from capital gains, and should be reported in position 53 of the CIT-8 form.<br><br>For the CIT-8/O attachment, specific positions (170, 171, 172) should be completed to reflect the waiver of tax collection based on a ministerial regulation dated July 16, 2021.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_550" style="display:none;">Since 2017, VAT regulations stipulated that if a taxpayer received an intra-Community acquisition invoice within three months of the end of the month when the tax liability arose, and declared the corresponding output VAT in the period the liability arose, they could deduct the input VAT in the same period. However, significant delays in invoice issuance by suppliers created a risk of retrospective tax declaration, potentially leading to interest penalties.<br><br>The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled in case C-895/19 on March 18, 2021, that this "separated timing" for intra-Community acquisitions was incompatible with EU law. The CJEU emphasized that the principle of neutrality requires VAT payment and deduction to occur in the same period, preventing taxpayers from bearing the burden of VAT for which no amount is due to tax authorities.<br><br>Following this ruling, a VAT law amendment effective September 7, 2021, aligned Polish regulations with the CJEU judgment. This amendment allows taxpayers to report both output and input VAT for intra-Community acquisitions in the same period, provided the output VAT is declared when due. This change offers more favorable tax treatment and opens the possibility for claiming refunds of interest paid under the previous, less advantageous rules.<br><br>agnieszka.drozdz-wilk@moorepolska.pl</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_550" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_550" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_550" style="display:none;"></p>

A loss occurs when the costs incurred to generate revenue exceed the total revenue itself. Specifically, a loss from qualified intellectual property (IP) arises when the expenses associated with that IP surpass the income derived from it.<br><br>Taxpayers can offset their taxable income with losses from qualified IP. This offset is permissible within the next five consecutive tax years, provided the loss stems from the same qualified IP. It's crucial to understand that the IP BOX regulations do not permit the pooling of income and losses from different qualified IPs to offset one another. Furthermore, losses from qualified IPs cannot be used to reduce income derived from other sources, such as those taxed under general tax scales (18%/32%) or the flat tax rate (19%). This exclusion also applies if the taxpayer subsequently ceases to generate income from qualified IPs, rendering the prior loss unrecoverable. The principle works conversely as well; losses from non-qualified IP sources cannot offset income from qualified IPs.<br><br>An exception exists where a taxpayer cannot precisely allocate income or loss to individual IPs used in products or services. In such cases, losses can be recognized against the same product or service category where the qualified IP was employed. However, this is an exception, and taxpayers are expected to maintain detailed records that clearly distinguish individual qualified IPs and their respective revenues, costs, and resulting income or loss.<br><br>For further inquiries, please contact us.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_552" style="display:none;">Regulations concerning Article 15e of the CIT Act on limiting the deductibility of costs – the fate of the provision.<br><br>The repeal of Article 15e of the CIT Act at the beginning of 2022 removed a provision that, due to its structure, contained an open catalog of intangible services subject to cost limitation. This led to numerous individual tax interpretations and administrative court rulings. However, the application of Article 15e's solutions is not entirely excluded, as they are implemented in regulations related to the so-called minimum tax, suggesting further interpretative disputes. Nevertheless, given court rulings resolving ambiguities surrounding cost limitations under Article 15e, entities that have applied its provisions can analyze their past tax settlements to assess the possibility of claiming refunds for overpaid CIT tax in previous years.<br><br>Clarified doubts by administrative courts – taxpayer opportunities.<br><br>A Supreme Administrative Court ruling on June 1, 2021 (ref. II FSK 364/21) established that technical support services for production machinery, investment project coordination, productivity improvement initiatives, and waste reduction projects are not similar to services listed in Article 15e(1)(1) of the CIT Act and thus are not subject to limitation. The court emphasized that the nature of the service, not solely its PKWiU classification, should determine its applicability.<br><br>Another ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court on December 16, 2021 (ref. II FSK 841/19) found that sales intermediation services, where agents find customers and facilitate sales agreements without directly concluding them, do not constitute services similar to advertising. The court stated that promotional activities within these intermediation services do not dominate and are not characteristic of advertising.<br><br>A ruling by the Provincial Administrative Court in Gliwice on February 17, 2021 (ref. I SA/Gl 1746/20) determined that IT support services, including IT solution implementation, software maintenance, IT security procedures, network access provision, technical support, and website maintenance, are not similar to advisory or management and control services as defined in Article 15e. The court clarified that these services are routine and technical, unlike external management or control responsibilities.<br><br>Conclusions and recommendations – how we can help.<br><br>Discrepancies between tax authorities and administrative courts, along with numerous interpretations and rulings, highlight the persistent ambiguities surrounding Article 15e of the CIT Act. Companies adopting a cautious approach due to these interpretative differences might have overpaid their taxes. Analyzing past settlements in light of current interpretation and case law can lead to tax refunds.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_554" style="display:none;">On February 21, 2022, the Supreme Administrative Court issued a resolution (III FPS 2/21) clarifying the tax treatment of goodwill. Goodwill, defined as the positive difference between the acquisition price of a business or its organized part and the market value of its assets, had previously led to divergent court rulings regarding its taxability under the Civil Law Transactions Tax (PCC) act.<br><br>The PCC act taxes the sale of tangible assets and property rights. Some courts had argued that goodwill constituted a property right due to its transferability and quantifiable value, thus making it subject to PCC. Conversely, other courts maintained that goodwill was merely a factual state arising at the moment of sale and not an independent property right existing prior to the transaction, therefore exempt from PCC.<br><br>The Supreme Administrative Court's resolution aligned with the latter interpretation, ruling that goodwill is not a property right subject to PCC. The court reasoned that goodwill, as an asset value, emerges only at the point of business acquisition and is not composed of property rights. It distinguished goodwill from the business itself, which is a collection of assets.<br><br>This definitive ruling provides an opportunity for taxpayers who have paid PCC on goodwill to claim a refund of overpaid tax, provided the tax obligation has not expired. Typically, tax refund claims are possible for obligations arising in 2017 or later.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_554" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_554" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_554" style="display:none;"></p>

Instead of escalating conflict by asserting superiority, acknowledge and respect the other person's opinion, even if you believe you are entirely correct. This is the first step to de-escalating a dispute.<br><br>Avoiding arguments is crucial, as conflicts negatively impact the entire team's morale and productivity, potentially leading to employee turnover. Leaders must foster an environment where open and respectful discussion of diverse opinions is encouraged. When disagreements arise, leaders should remain calm, avoid instinctive aggression, and not defend their views at all costs. Effective communication, clear messaging, and avoiding information noise are paramount.<br><br>A good leader confronts issues rather than avoiding them, seeking to understand the root cause of conflicts, whether it's poor criticism delivery or communication breakdowns. They remain objective, fair, and admit mistakes readily, understanding that humility and strong arguments are more effective than asserting authority. In some situations, a leader recognizes when a debate is unproductive and it's better to disengage, particularly when dealing with individuals who are firmly convinced they are right despite evidence to the contrary. Building a culture of dialogue and acceptance within teams minimizes conflicts, allowing leaders to focus on growth and development, confident that any misunderstandings can be resolved smoothly.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_555" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_555" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_555" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_556" style="display:none;">The influx of Ukrainian refugees into Poland necessitates the determination of their tax residency for Personal Income Tax (PIT) purposes, especially when they earn income beyond standard employment contracts. This is crucial for both employers, who are responsible for withholding PIT advances, and employees, as tax residency impacts their tax liabilities.<br><br>Polish PIT law states that non-residents with limited tax liability pay a flat 20% tax on income earned in Poland from personal activities like service or work contracts. This means no tax-free allowance and specific income-earning cost deductions, which can be disadvantageous. Generally, an individual is considered a tax resident in Poland if they have their center of personal or economic interests there or have stayed in Poland for over 183 days in a tax year. However, double taxation treaties, like the one with Ukraine, can alter these rules.<br><br>The bilateral agreement with Ukraine is complex and doesn't explicitly use the 183-day rule common in OECD models. To clarify this, the Polish Ministry of Finance has advised that Ukrainian citizens can confirm their Polish tax residency by submitting a declaration of having their center of personal or economic interests in Poland. Upon submitting this declaration, they are considered Polish tax residents from their arrival date. Employers are generally not obligated to verify the truthfulness of such declarations unless they possess contrary information. This means working Ukrainians can potentially pay a reduced PIT rate, benefit from tax-free allowances and standard income-earning cost deductions, similar to Polish citizens.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_556" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_556" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_556" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_558" style="display:none;">On April 1, 2022, the Minister of Finance issued a general interpretation clarifying that expenses incurred for the repayment of a loan taken out to purchase a property that is subsequently sold can be considered as expenditures for the taxpayer's own housing purposes, effective for the legal status until December 31, 2021. This "housing relief" exempts income from the sale of property if the proceeds are reinvested in one's own housing needs within three years. Previously, there was legal ambiguity, with some tax authorities and courts arguing that only the acquisition of a new property qualified, while others accepted loan repayments. This new interpretation confirms that using sale proceeds to repay a loan (including consolidation and refinancing loans, and their interest) used for the sold property's purchase constitutes a legitimate housing expenditure. Consequently, taxpayers who previously paid tax on such income and whose tax obligations have not expired can now claim a refund for overpaid tax. The interpretation specifies that various household appliances and custom-built furniture also fall under qualifying housing expenditures. The Ministry of Finance's stance means that tax calculations that did not account for loan repayments as a housing expense were incorrect, and taxpayers can seek redress.<br><br>On April 1, 2022, the Minister of Finance clarified that repaying a loan used to buy a property that is later sold qualifies as an expenditure for one's own housing purposes, thus eligible for tax relief. This "housing relief" exempts income from property sales if the proceeds are reinvested in housing needs within a three-year period. Previously, there was legal uncertainty, with differing court and tax authority opinions on whether loan repayments counted towards this purpose. This new general interpretation definitively states that using sale proceeds to repay the original loan (and its interest) for the sold property constitutes a valid housing expenditure. This allows taxpayers who previously paid tax on such income and whose tax obligations are not time-barred to claim a refund for overpaid tax. The interpretation also confirms that specific household appliances and custom-made furniture are also considered qualifying housing expenses. The Ministry of Finance's stance corrects prior incorrect tax assessments and offers a path to reclaim overpaid taxes.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_558" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_558" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_558" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_560" style="display:none;">The document outlines methods for valuing key financial items, particularly focusing on fair value and amortized cost. Fair value is defined by accounting law as the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled in a market transaction between informed, independent parties. Reliable fair value can be determined through active market prices, estimations based on similar instruments, using valuation models with market-derived inputs, or generally accepted estimation methods. If reliable fair value cannot be determined, assets are valued at cost less impairments, and liabilities at amortized cost, with changes recognized in financial income or expenses. Subsequently revaluing to fair value involves transferring the difference between book value and fair value to the revaluation reserve. Amortized cost is the initial book value of a financial asset or liability, adjusted for principal repayments, the cumulative discount or premium amortized using the effective interest rate method, and impairments or provisions. The effective interest rate calculation includes all fees and commissions received by the bank associated with the creation of the amortized cost asset. The text also refers to related articles on specific provisions and collateral adjustments.<br><br>The document explains valuation methods for financial assets and liabilities, emphasizing fair value and amortized cost.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_562" style="display:none;">Investment agreements are a relatively new type of agreement introduced into the Tax Ordinance on January 1, 2022. These agreements are contracts between a taxpayer and a tax authority, specifically addressing the tax implications of an investor's actions. They aim to enhance tax law certainty and ensure consistent interpretation of tax regulations, ultimately increasing an investor's tax security.<br><br>To enter into an investment agreement, an entity must possess "investor" status, meaning they are planning or commencing an investment in Poland. An "investment" is defined as a significant commitment to fixed assets or intangible assets, such as establishing a new plant, expanding production, diversifying output, or fundamentally changing a production process. The acquisition of assets from a closing business is also included, provided it's from an unrelated entity and doesn't involve purchasing company shares. The minimum investment value is PLN 50,000,000, with foreign currency valuations based on the National Bank of Poland's exchange rate on the first day of the month of application.<br><br>These agreements can cover various aspects, including the assessment of transfer pricing in controlled transactions under arm's length conditions, the tax benefits of a proposed investment, the classification of excise goods or passenger cars according to the Harmonized System (HS), and the description and classification of goods or services with appropriate tax rates. They can also include interpretations of tax law not covered by the previous points. Investment agreements are seen as an alternative to other tax rulings like advance pricing agreements or individual tax interpretations, offering greater protection and security.<br><br>The process begins with an application from the investor or a group of investors. The application requires identifying information, contact details, a description of the investment, its declared value, the proposed duration of the agreement, and its subject matter. An initial fee of PLN 50,000 is required per applicant, with a main fee ranging from PLN 100,000 to PLN 500,000, as determined by the agreement itself. Importantly, applications and related documents can be in English to encourage foreign investment. These agreements are binding for up to 5 tax years.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_562" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_562" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_562" style="display:none;"></p>

It is irrelevant whether they are ready for use or not.<br><br>External indicators of impairment include: circumstances suggesting receivables may not be collected due to external factors like technological, market, economic, or legal changes. This also covers situations where recovering costs for long-term services is uncertain due to disputed contracts, legal actions, or inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Changes in the timing of cash flows expected from an asset due to financial difficulties, significant market price declines beyond normal wear and tear, increases in supplier costs or decreases in customer prices, anticipated rises in selling costs, adverse changes in financial markets or investments, significant negative technological, market, economic, or legal shifts, or increases in market interest rates that impact discount rates can also signal impairment. A net book value exceeding the market or fair value of issued shares is another indicator.<br><br>Internal indicators of impairment include: evidence of physical damage to tangible assets, significant unfavorable changes in how assets are used or will be used, the company’s intention to discontinue or restructure activities related to certain assets, plans to dispose of or liquidate an asset earlier than expected, or evidence that the economic benefits from an asset's use are or will be worse than anticipated.<br><br>Upon identifying potential impairment indicators, entities must identify individual cash-generating assets, assess for impairment, and make necessary write-downs.

Impairment indicators can stem from both external and internal sources. External signs include economic downturns, legal issues, market volatility, technological obsolescence, and changes in interest rates. Internal indicators focus on the physical condition of assets, changes in their usage, management's intentions to discontinue or sell assets, and underperformance compared to expectations. When impairment indicators are present, companies must identify cash-generating assets (individually or in groups), assess for value loss, and record necessary impairment charges to adjust asset values to their recoverable amounts.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_563" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_563" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_563" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_566" style="display:none;">A new amendment to the Polish Deal tax system came into effect on March 10, 2022, with two primary objectives: clarifying the application of the PIT-2 form and regulating the extension of income tax advance payment deadlines into law.<br><br>Regarding the PIT-2 form, employers are now obligated to apply the monthly tax-reducing amount of PLN 425 immediately upon receiving a PIT-2 declaration at any point during the year, effective from the month following receipt. A previously submitted PIT-2 remains valid for subsequent years unless the underlying circumstances change. Previously, this reduction was only applicable if the PIT-2 was submitted before the first payment of the tax year.<br><br>The amendment also introduces statutory provisions for extending income tax advance payment deadlines for income earned in 2022 up to PLN 12,800 gross per month. This applies to income tax advances from employment, service contracts, and certain social security benefits. Advance payments are now calculated twice: based on current rules (no health insurance deduction, higher tax-reducing amount, middle-class relief) and pre-December 31, 2021 rules (partial health insurance deduction, lower tax-reducing amount). The lower advance payment is collected, with the difference deferred. If no months with a lower current calculation occur, the remaining tax is due with the annual tax return. Employees, including those who have submitted PIT-2, can now request not to have their advance payment deadlines extended, effective from the month following the request.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_566" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_566" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_566" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_567" style="display:none;">We invite you to familiarize yourself with the previous articles in the "Get to know IP BOX with us!" series. This article explains the basic principles of expectancy when using IP BOX, based on tax explanations from July 15, 2019.<br><br>Expectancy refers to the waiting period for protection to be granted. For taxpayers starting to use IP BOX preferences, this period begins when an application for intellectual property rights protection is filed. This allows for conditional use of preferential taxation due to the lengthy process of granting protection. Therefore, a 5% tax rate can be applied from the moment of filing an application, even before the right is registered.<br><br>If the relevant authority refuses protection, rejects the application, or denies registration, the taxpayer must pay tax at the standard rates (9% or 19% for CIT, or 18/32% or 19% for PIT). The difference between the tax already paid at 5% and the amount due under standard rates will need to be settled.<br><br>In certain situations, like an appeal procedure, the expectancy period can be extended until a final decision is made. However, if protection is ultimately denied, the taxpayer must pay taxes according to their applicable business tax rates.<br><br>Copyrights to computer programs are an exception as they are not registered and protection is granted by law from the moment of creation, not upon application.<br><br>We encourage you to contact us with any further questions and to stay tuned for the rest of the IP BOX series.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_567" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_567" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_567" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_568" style="display:none;">The BDO (Database on Products and Packaging and Waste Management) is a system established by Polish waste management law to collect data on waste and manage registration, record-keeping, and reporting obligations. Businesses that generate, transport, process, or manage waste are generally required to register. This includes entities that import products in packaging, tires, lubricants, vehicles, batteries, accumulators, or electrical and electronic equipment into Poland. Critically, businesses introducing any products in packaging into the country, even simple palletized goods wrapped in stretch film, must register.<br><br>However, sole proprietorships generating only municipal waste, which is collected by the local waste management system, are exempt. This means businesses like accounting firms or law offices, which produce typical household waste, are not typically subject to BDO registration. The registration process is entirely electronic, handled by regional marshals, and requires a trusted profile login. Key company details and the basis for registration must be provided. The registration fee is 100 PLN for micro-enterprises and 300 PLN for others, with annual fees of the same amount. Registered businesses must display their BDO registration number on all official documents. Failure to comply can result in penalties, including fines up to 1,000,000 PLN, for activities such as operating without registration or omitting the BDO number from documents.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_568" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_568" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_568" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_569" style="display:none;">The article discusses the nomenclature of job positions and categorizes them into four levels: senior management (CEOs, presidents), junior management (department/team heads), specialists, and support staff. It highlights the distinction between a manager and a leader, emphasizing that a leader actively nurtures their team.<br><br>A 2020 Grant Thornton study revealed that globally, only 29% of women hold senior management positions, with a mere 20% in CEO roles and 18% as COOs. McKinsey & Company's 2021 research indicates that for every 100 men promoted to management, only 72 women are promoted, leaving most women at lower organizational levels. This suggests a continued masculinization of top positions, with men dominating roles like CFO, CIO, and CMO. In Poland, a 2019 Eurostat study found women held 47% of managerial positions, ranking second in Europe, but only 13% of board seats in large listed companies, below the EU average.<br><br>Surprisingly, Africa leads with 38% of women in senior management, followed by Western Europe and ASEAN countries at 35%. Latin America has 33%, the EU and Southern Europe 30%, and North America and APAC lag behind. Recent reforms promoting gender equality in Africa and the #MeToo movement potentially influencing organizational changes in Latin America are cited as reasons for their progress. Medium-sized companies globally show the highest employment of women in senior roles, with a stable 87% in 2019.<br><br>Despite a decade of progress, the article argues that the 9% increase in women in management is insufficient given the pace of global change, suggesting stagnation. It advocates for greater openness and diversity of thought, not forced parity, recognizing the value of women in leadership. Moore Polska is presented as an example of gender balance, with women constituting the majority of employees and senior management.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_569" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_569" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_569" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_570" style="display:none;">The article emphasizes the critical importance of maintaining accurate and separate accounting records for taxpayers utilizing the IP BOX tax incentive. While no specific template for IP BOX record-keeping exists, the law mandates that taxpayers clearly identify each qualified intellectual property right within their accounting books. This includes isolating revenues, costs, and income attributable to each IP. Failure to do so, or if the records do not allow for the determination of income from IP, can lead to the loss of the reduced tax rate.<br><br>Tax authorities' guidelines further underscore the need for distinct records for IP BOX-related income and expenses, particularly research and development costs. Taxpayers should proactively plan and implement their accounting systems to meet these informational needs, considering budget allocations, tax regulations, and technical capabilities. For those using the simplified tax ledger (PKPiR), a well-archived spreadsheet can suffice. Specific attention must be paid to employee costs, requiring detailed project descriptions, timelines, personnel involvement, and the allocation of remuneration to R&D activities versus other duties, as stipulated in employment contracts and job descriptions. Proper record-keeping is essential to avoid tax authority challenges and to benefit from the IP BOX regime.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_570" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_570" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_570" style="display:none;"></p>

When speaking about Moore Polska, this statement is not an exaggeration in any way. Women are not only the foundation of the company's operations but also its founders. The history of Moore Polska is a story of the strength and determination of intelligent women who were not afraid to make difficult decisions and often took risks.<br><br>In the late 1980s, Poland's free-market economy began to develop intensely. Private businesses emerged, and talented managers sought personal fulfillment and development. It is no surprise that those with professional experience made bold decisions to create their own companies. This was the case for Irena Leczyk and her two daughters, Roma Żuchowska and Lidia Skudławska, currently Managing Partner of Moore Polska. Their determination, knowledge, and experience led to the debut of FINANSISTA in 1989, a company that quickly solidified its position as a synonym for professional client service, punctuality, and excellent execution.<br><br>Shortly after, in 1992, WIT accounting firm debuted, founded by Lucyna Witek, a statutory auditor, after her return from a diplomatic post in Baghdad. WIT became the genesis of the family company REWIT, established in 1994 through the hard work of Lucyna's family. REWIT soon became one of the most reputable and respected firms in the market.<br><br>Women have been the strength of Moore Polska from the beginning. They are open to new challenges, dialogue, and make bold decisions. Their experience educates subsequent generations in accounting, auditing, and business consulting. They look bravely to the future while remembering their history. They are the bedrock of the company, employing over 220 experts, including 30 statutory auditors and 3 tax advisors, with women comprising 87% of the staff and the majority in managerial positions. The founders' perseverance, hard work, and the strength of the teams they built have resulted in a strong auditing firm with an established market position. Moore Polska celebrates its female team, acknowledging their continuous contribution to the company's development and wishing them further success.<br><br>Moore Polska is a testament to the strength and vision of women. Founded by Irena Leczyk and her daughters in 1989, and influenced by Lucyna Witek’s accounting firm established in 1992, the company’s history is deeply intertwined with female leadership and determination. Women form the backbone of Moore Polska, constituting 87% of its workforce and a majority in management roles. This female-led environment fosters growth, innovation, and a commitment to excellence in auditing, accounting, and consulting services.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_572" style="display:none;">This article, the third in a series on IP BOX, delves into the tax settlement aspects of this intellectual property incentive. It explains that the taxable base for IP BOX is the sum of income from qualified intellectual property rights earned during the tax year, calculated as the product of income from specific IP rights and the NEXUS indicator. The NEXUS indicator, crucial for IP BOX, is calculated separately for each qualified IP right and represents the ratio of taxpayer's costs related to R&D activities (direct R&D, acquisition of results from unrelated or related entities, and acquisition of the IP right itself) to the total costs. This indicator cannot exceed 1.<br><br>The article clarifies that income covered by IP BOX is not included when determining the base for solidarity tax. It also details the annual tax return process, noting that no separate notifications are required, with settlements made in the annual tax return using the PIT/IP annex. Overpaid advance payments are generally refunded. Finally, it mentions that in specific cases related to COVID-19 countermeasures, taxpayers may be eligible to apply the 5% tax rate for IP BOX during the tax year.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_572" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_572" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_572" style="display:none;"></p>

Effective teamwork leads to efficient work, timely results, and ultimately, company success. Leaders need to command respect through charisma and emotional intelligence, paired with hard work, good habits, and systematic actions. They listen, understand their team, and are creative, logical thinkers who grasp the needs of both individuals and the organization. Good leaders foster success and well-being through dialogue and encouragement, not punishment or degradation, while remaining productive and outcome-focused.<br><br>True leadership isn't about authoritarian commands or diminishing employees. Strength lies in empowering others to find solutions, not dictating them. A good leader listens, analyzes, and shares insights constructively, using even criticism as a teaching opportunity. They can effectively argue their point and know when to say "no" for the good of the team and company, acting fairly in all circumstances. Their proposals are accepted not through dictation, but through knowledge and strong communication skills.<br><br>Partnership is key to Moore Polska's success, extending from client relations to internal team collaboration. Leaders at Moore Polska unite employees and guide them through challenging projects, fostering healthy structures where dialogue benefits business relationships.

To qualify, taxpayers must be engaged in research and development (R&D) activities. R&D is defined as creative activity involving scientific research or development work, systematically undertaken to increase knowledge and use it to create new applications. This can include scientific research alone, development work alone, or both.<br><br>Eligible income must stem from qualified intellectual property (IP) rights. These include patents, utility model protection rights, industrial design registration rights, integrated circuit topography registration rights, plant variety protection rights, and computer software copyrights. Crucially, these rights must be legally protected and must have been created, developed, or improved by the taxpayer through their R&D activities. Income from qualified IP can arise from licensing fees, sales of the IP, IP incorporated into product pricing, or compensation for IP infringement. Taxpayers can deduct qualified costs directly related to the creation, development, or improvement of these IP rights, such as materials, salaries of R&D staff, and patent maintenance costs.<br><br>IP BOX is a beneficial tax incentive for businesses investing in innovation, offering a significant reduction in tax liability on income generated from their intellectual property.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_575" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_575" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_575" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_576" style="display:none;">On January 28, 2022, a bill amending the "Polski Ład" (Polish Deal) was sent to the Senate. This article explains the PIT-2 statement, a voluntary declaration by employees to their employers to reduce their monthly income tax advance. By submitting PIT-2, an employer lowers the tax advance by 1/12 of the tax-reducing amount. In 2022, this amount is PLN 5,100 annually, meaning a monthly reduction of PLN 425.<br><br>PIT-2 is not applicable to individuals earning income from civil law contracts like service agreements or works contracts. It's crucial for employees with multiple employment contracts, business activity, or pensions to submit PIT-2 to only one payer to avoid underpayment penalties during annual tax settlement. The increased significance of PIT-2 in 2022 stems from the "Polski Ład," which raised the annual tax-reducing amount from PLN 525.12 to PLN 5,100.<br><br>PIT-2 is typically submitted before starting employment and remains valid until revoked. However, the recent amendment allows submission during the year, with the reduction applied from the following month. The statement confirms the employee's eligibility for the tax reduction at that specific workplace. A key change in the amended PIT-2 addresses individuals receiving pensions or annuities, allowing them to opt out of the tax-reducing amount through a specific application to the pension authority. If a PIT-2 is not submitted, employees can still claim the tax-reducing amount during their annual tax return. It's important to distinguish PIT-2 from the "middle-class relief" as they are separate tax preferences.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_576" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_576" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_576" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_577" style="display:none;">We encourage you to also read the first article on BANK ACCOUNTING AND THE CREATION OF SPECIFIC RESERVES.<br><br>The Regulation of the Minister of Finance of December 16, 2008, on the principles of creating specific reserves for risks associated with bank activities (Journal of Laws of 2021, item 1238), hereinafter referred to as the Regulation, grants banks the right, not the obligation, to use deductions from the base for calculating specific reserves.<br><br>A bank may decide not to consider the value of accepted collateral in the process of creating specific reserves. Nevertheless, the applicable rules in this regard should result from the adopted accounting policy and internal bank regulations. In accordance with Article 10 of the Accounting Act, entities should have documentation describing their adopted accounting principles (policy), including those concerning methods of valuing assets and liabilities and determining financial results. The adopted principles should be applied consistently and invariantly, which means the need to eliminate discretion when applying deductions.<br><br>The basis for creating specific reserves for risks related to credit exposures classified as "under observation" or "doubtful" groups, and for receivables adjustments related to these credit exposures (interest), can be reduced by the value of collateral specified in Annex No. 2, paragraph 3 of the Regulation. Banks review and update the value of collateral by which the basis for creating specific reserves and receivables adjustments related to credit exposures has been reduced, following the procedure applicable to the review and classification of credit exposures.<br><br>If a bank has credit exposures to a debtor, which include both balance sheet receivables and off-balance sheet commitments, and unless the contract terms state otherwise, the held collateral is first considered in determining the basis for creating specific reserves for balance sheet receivables and receivables adjustments related to credit exposures.<br><br>What is important?<br><br>Deductions can be made if, on the date of review, all the following conditions are met:<br>The value of the collateral is recoverable, to the extent taken into account for the deduction from the base for creating reserves and receivables adjustments related to credit exposures, during potential enforcement proceedings, considering legal, economic, and factual limitations that may affect the bank's actual ability to satisfy itself from the collateral;<br>The collateral is not or has not been used to substitute the assessment of the debtor's economic and financial situation with the assessment of the collateral issuer's economic and financial situation.<br><br>The deduction from the base for creating specific reserves and receivables adjustments related to credit exposures can be applied when the bank holds the following collateral:<br>1) Mortgages – the amount cannot exceed the registered value in the land and mortgage register and 50% of the value determined by a valuator. If the valuator's appraisal does not account for prior encumbrances, this value should first be reduced by the total amount of these encumbrances, and 60% of the bank-mortgage value of the property;<br>2) Transfer of ownership of movable property – cannot exceed 50% of the net sale value of the movable property and 50% of the original secured amount;<br>3) Transfer of ownership of securities, except those issued by the State Treasury, the National Bank of Poland, central banks, or governments of member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and other banks – cannot exceed 50% of their fair value;<br>4) Pledge on a sea or air vessel – cannot exceed 50% of the valuator's appraisal and 50% of the original secured amount;<br>5) Registered pledge on rights from securities – cannot exceed 50% of their fair value;<br>6) Registered pledge on movable property – cannot exceed 50% of the net sale value of the movable property and 50% of the original secured amount.<br><br>In addition to the above limitations, banks are obliged to apply deduction limits, which since April 17, 2020, are:<br>For credit exposures secured by a mortgage, by which the base for creating specific reserves and receivables adjustments related to credit exposures can be reduced, the deduction amount cannot be greater than the limit for specific periods of payment arrears specified below:<br>For credit exposures for which collateral mentioned in paragraph 3 of Annex No. 2 to the Regulation has been applied, excluding those specified in point 1, the deduction from the basis for creating specific reserves and receivables adjustments related to credit exposures cannot be greater than the deduction limit for specific periods of payment arrears, specified below:<br><br>In practice, the most commonly used collateral for deductions, and also widely considered the best protection for receivables, is mortgages, transfer of ownership of movable property (fiduciary assignment, registered bank pledge), and guarantees or endorsements from a recognized institution (guarantee funds, BGK).<br><br>What requires special attention?<br>The Regulation amendments that came into effect on April 17, 2020, introduced:<br>The possibility of counting the number of days in arrears according to the second/amended repayment schedule occurs if the first schedule was concluded before the effective date of this Regulation (amending), and the second schedule was concluded between April 17 and December 31, 2020; In the case of subsequent changes to repayment dates (schedules), arrears in credit exposure repayment are counted according to the repayment dates (schedule) established in the second change, meaning the second schedule applies for the entire "life" of the exposure; Extension of the period for banks to include credit collateral for the purpose of reducing the base for creating specific reserves, i.e., changes to the limits specified in Annex No. 3.<br>The provisions of the amending Regulation indicate that the changes apply for the first time to specific reserves and receivables adjustments related to credit exposures created after the effective date of this Regulation – which means that banks could not resolve specific reserves created before April 17, 2020, due to changes related to limits, in connection with the extension of arrears periods.<br><br>What are the most common irregularities?<br>1) Application of deductions from the base for creating reserves/adjustments based on mortgage collateral when:<br>The property has significant restrictions on its disposal in Section III, i.e., prohibition of sale and/or further encumbrance, in connection with ongoing court proceedings, e.g., due to a fraudulent conveyance action; The mortgage has been deregistered due to a completed sale through enforcement proceedings, and the settlement with the Bank has not yet occurred (funds remain in court deposit through the ongoing distribution procedure by a receiver).<br>2) When determining the value of real estate:<br>Encumbrances on the property with limited property rights affecting its value change have not been taken into account. Article 244 § 1 of the Civil Code indicates that limited property rights include, among others, usufruct (most commonly for housing or utilities); The appraisal report covers more than one land and mortgage register with a combined valuation, i.e., it does not specify separate valuations for individual properties, which means there is no possibility of reliably determining the amount of deduction from the reserve calculation base.<br>3) Bank's discretion in applying deductions (e.g., deduction applied in one case, not in another) – a practice inconsistent with the adopted accounting policy and other internal regulations.<br><br>Summary<br>As mentioned at the beginning, the regulations on the creation of specific reserves and receivables adjustments speak of the possibility, not the obligation, to make deductions from the base for calculating reserves by the value of accepted collateral. Although rare, situations occur where banks accept collateral that allows for a reduction in the base for creating specific reserves but do not utilize this possibility. This situation most often concerns small cooperative banks, which, having low equity and simultaneously a high rate of return, see these "hidden" reserves as an additional capital buffer protecting against negative phenomena in the future. Nevertheless, the principles applied in this regard should stem from the adopted accounting policy and internal bank regulations.<br><br>For additional questions, please feel free to contact us.<br><br>banking accounting,specific reserves,collateral<br><br>Please contact us<br><br>michal.ossowski@moorepolska.pl<br><br>Banks have the right, but not the obligation, to reduce the base for calculating specific reserves for credit risks by the value of accepted collateral, as per the Minister of Finance's regulation. This deduction is optional and must be consistently applied according to the bank's accounting policy and internal regulations. Collateral must be recoverable in enforcement proceedings, considering all limitations, and not used to substitute a debtor's financial assessment. Specific collateral types, like mortgages and movable property transfers, have valuation limits. Amendments in April 2020 extended the period for including collateral and adjusted arrears calculation rules, with new rules applying to reserves created after the effective date. Common irregularities include applying deductions with unaddressed property encumbrances, incorrect property valuation, and inconsistent application of deductions due to bank discretion. Some small banks may forgo deductions to build "hidden" capital reserves.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_577" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_577" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_577" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_581" style="display:none;">The Act of March 4, 1994, outlines the regulations for the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS) in Poland. Employers operating as budgetary units and local government budgetary establishments must create the fund regardless of the number of employees. Other employers' obligations depend on their employee count as of January 1, 2022. Employers with at least 50 full-time employees must create a ZFŚS, while those with 20 to 49 employees must do so if a trade union requests it. Employers with fewer than 50 employees can opt out of creating the fund and paying holiday benefits.<br><br>Mandatory ZFŚS contributions are specified for employees in normal or special conditions, as well as for juvenile workers. The base for calculating contributions in 2022 is the average monthly wage in the national economy for the second half of 2019, which is 4,434.58 PLN. Contributions range from 1,662.97 PLN for employees in normal conditions to varying amounts for those in arduous conditions or juvenile trainees. Additional contributions are made for disabled employees, retirees under the employer's social care, and employers operating nurseries or children's clubs.<br><br>The allocation of subsidized services and benefits depends on the individual's living, family, and financial situation, as detailed in the employer's regulations. Employers obligated to establish a ZFŚS can lower the fund contribution with union or employee representative agreement. Decisions regarding ZFŚS, including not creating a fund or paying holiday benefits, must be made by the end of January 2022.<br><br>Holiday benefits apply to firms with fewer than 50 employees or those who opted out of ZFŚS, paid once a year to employees taking at least 14 consecutive days of vacation, up to a maximum of 1,662.97 PLN in 2022. These differ from "vacation under the pear tree" benefits (wczasy pod gruszą), which are funded by the ZFŚS and based on financial need. Holiday benefits, in contrast, do not consider financial status but require 14 days of vacation. Holiday benefits are exempt from social security contributions, unlike discretionary vacation bonuses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_581" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_581" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_581" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_582" style="display:none;">Effective January 1, 2022, taxpayers can opt out of VAT exemptions for certain financial services in Poland.<br><br>Currently, financial services are generally VAT exempt. The Polish Deal introduces the option for taxpayers to choose taxation for services provided to other taxpayers. This opt-out applies to all financial services provided to taxpayers; selective application is not permitted. Services provided to individuals (B2C) remain mandatorily exempt.<br><br>To opt for taxation, taxpayers must notify the head of the tax office before the start of the tax period and register as an active VAT payer. They can revert to VAT exemption after two years from the initial taxation period by notifying the tax office before the relevant tax period. Re-electing taxation is possible only after another two years of being exempt.<br><br>The changes affect specific financial services listed in the VAT Act, including currency transactions, investment fund management, lending services, guarantees, deposit services, transactions involving shares in companies, and transactions in financial instruments (excluding storage and management).<br><br>Opting for VAT taxation allows taxpayers to deduct VAT on purchases related to taxable activities, unlike the VAT exemption, which does not permit such deductions.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_582" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_582" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_582" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_583" style="display:none;">The amendment to the Act on Counteracting Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing (AML Act) came into full effect on October 31, 2021. AML, or Anti-Money Laundering, is a core obligation for Polish entrepreneurs, stemming from EU law, and aims to prevent the circulation of illegally sourced assets and the financing of criminal activities. Businesses must possess accurate information about their contractors to avoid potential repercussions for oversight in detecting and reporting financial crimes.<br><br>The AML Act applies to "obliged institutions," including financial and insurance entities, as well as other businesses like accounting service providers, real estate agents, notaries, lawyers (with limitations), offshore and company service providers, and businesses accepting cash payments of €10,000 or more.<br><br>An AML procedure is a set of rules tailored to the nature and size of a business and requires approval from a member of the management board or an employee with relevant expertise. It should cover risk assessment, prevention methods, financial security measures, and internal reporting procedures. Special emphasis should be placed on training employees to properly adhere to the AML procedure. Identifying and verifying the beneficial owner, who controls the transactions, is vital and their identity is disclosed in the Central Register of Beneficial Owners (CRBR). Failure to comply with the AML Act can result in administrative penalties, including publication of violations, orders to cease specific actions, license revocation, bans on holding managerial positions, and fines of up to €1,000,000.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_583" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_583" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_583" style="display:none;"></p>

Invoices can now be issued up to 60 days (previously 30) before the transaction. Corrective invoices no longer require the terms "corrective invoice" or "correction," nor the reason for correction, unless they are structured e-invoices, which then necessitate the original invoice's ID from the National e-Invoice System. Collective corrective invoices can now apply to partial deliveries, requiring specification of the corrected goods or services. If an invoice contains overstated tax, the buyer adjusts the input tax in the period when the reduction conditions are agreed upon with the supplier. Re-issued invoices no longer mandatorily include "duplicate." Finally, advance invoices are no longer required to display the net unit price of goods or services.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_591" style="display:none;">The deadline for implementing the EU Directive 2019/1937 on the protection of whistleblowers was December 17, 2021. Employers should already be establishing suitable infrastructure for whistleblowers, even without national regulations. Creating channels for reporting and investigating irregularities is crucial, complementing ethical codes and employee feedback mechanisms. Effective communication is vital for identifying and eliminating issues within the company, possibly through a dedicated internal unit utilizing modern technologies.<br><br>The internal procedure includes: reporting through a designated channel, acknowledgment within 7 days, appointment of an impartial person/department for follow-up, undertaking actions, and providing feedback within 3 months of acknowledgment (or 3 months and 7 days from the original reporting date in the event there is no acknowledgement). Key elements include anonymity, restricted access to confidential data, due diligence, easily accessible information on the procedure, and allowing written, oral, indirect, or direct reporting.<br><br>Organizations with at least 50 employees and all public sector entities must establish internal reporting channels, although the deadline is extended to December 17, 2023, for employers with 50 to 249 employees. Those seeking more information on the technical and legal requirements of reporting procedures can contact experts for support and advice.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_591" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_591" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_591" style="display:none;"></p>

However, there are compensations and privileges to express gratitude for this act.<br><br>One of these is a tax deduction that can be claimed when filing an annual tax return.

This deduction is calculated based on the amount of blood or blood components donated, multiplied by a monetary equivalent established by the Ministry of Health which is currently set at 130 PLN per liter.<br><br>The deduction amount is calculated using a certificate from the blood collection unit, specifying the amount of blood or components donated. The maximum deduction cannot exceed 6% of the taxpayer's income.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_593" style="display:none;">Based on Polish law, specifically the Act of November 20, 1998, and the amendment of October 29, 2021, certain individuals and entities can choose taxation in the form of a lump-sum tax on recorded revenue in 2022. This includes individuals, inherited businesses, civil partnerships, and general partnerships, provided their 2021 revenue did not exceed 9,188,200 PLN (2 million EUR), or for new businesses, regardless of revenue. Certain activities are excluded, such as currency exchange offices, pharmacies, and trade in automotive parts.<br><br>The "Polish Deal" introduces changes to lump-sum tax rates. The 17% and 15% rates are reduced to 14% for healthcare, architectural/engineering, and specialized design services. The 15% rate is lowered to 12% for services related to specific software, software consulting, and IT system management. The definition of "freelance profession" has been narrowed, impacting tax rates for doctors, dentists, vets, technicians, midwives, nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists, architects, engineers, and hourly teachers.<br><br>Significant changes are made to health insurance contributions. The health insurance rate for lump-sum taxpayers is 9% of the assessment base. The monthly assessment base depends on income level and average monthly salary from the fourth quarter of the previous year. Specific rules and examples are provided, including exemptions for individuals with employment income below the minimum wage or self-employment income below 50% of the minimum wage, who have chosen the lump-sum taxation. A new revenue record template will be implemented in 2022. To switch to the lump-sum tax, a statement must be submitted by the 20th of the month following the first revenue or by the end of the year if the first revenue was in December. A detailed analysis of the optimal taxation form is recommended before making a choice.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_593" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_593" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_593" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_596" style="display:none;">The Polish Deal (amendment to income tax laws, effective January 1, 2022) significantly changes the rules for selling post-lease cars purchased for private use. Previously, individuals who bought their leased cars could sell them after six months from the end of the month of purchase without paying income tax.<br><br>Under the new regulations, a tax-free sale is only possible if the car is withdrawn from business activity and six years have passed between the first day of the month following the withdrawal and the date of sale. This means that entrepreneurs buying post-lease cars for private use after January 1, 2022, must wait six years to sell them tax-free. Otherwise, the sale is taxed under general rules, similar to the sale of movable property that were fixed assets.<br><br>However, transitional provisions state that the new rules apply only to assets acquired after December 31, 2021. So, if a car was purchased for private use by December 31, 2021, it can still be sold tax-free after six months. Example: Mr. Michal bought his car on December 30, 2021, and sold it on August 3, 2022, and he is exempt from tax due to the transitional rules. Example: Ms. Anna bought her car on January 3, 2022, and sold it on August 3, 2022, and she is subject to income tax because the 6-year period was not met.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_596" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_596" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_596" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_597" style="display:none;">Banks classify loans according to risk categories defined by the Minister of Finance, ranging from "normal" to "lost," with subdivisions like "under observation," "substandard," and "doubtful." The assessment of a debtor's economic and financial situation is a significant challenge, as the regulations provide only general guidelines, including quantitative (financial ratios) and qualitative (management assessment, market dependence) measures, as well as external credit ratings.<br><br>"Normal" indicates a sound financial situation, while "under observation" denotes heightened scrutiny due to regional, industry, or product risks, exemplified by the HORECA sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. "Substandard" signifies a potential threat to timely repayment, often due to losses or unmet projections. "Doubtful" implies substantial financial deterioration impacting capital, such as negative equity, though specific thresholds aren't defined. "Lost" signifies irreversible inability to repay, bankruptcy, liquidation, or legal disputes. Reclassification to a lower risk category is possible after the debtor regains full creditworthiness and maintains timely payments for at least three months. Banks must verify the full creditworthiness recovery before downgrading by a maximum of one category at a time. The absence of detailed regulations necessitates a high degree of individual assessment by banks.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_597" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_597" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_597" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_598" style="display:none;">A working time system is a set of regulations governing working hours within an establishment, specifying daily, weekly, and settlement period hour requirements. The Polish Labour Code recognizes several systems, including basic, equivalent, continuous operation, intermittent, task-based, and weekend work. The basic system involves an 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek over a 4-month settlement period. The equivalent system offers more flexibility by allowing for extended workdays, up to 12 hours, with compensatory shorter days or days off within the settlement period. This system can also extend the settlement period to 3, 4, or even 12 months in justified cases, allowing employers to balance longer hours with compensatory time off.<br><br>The equivalent system is suitable for jobs requiring flexibility due to their nature or organization, such as in hospitality, retail, or continuous supervision roles. Daily work limits can be extended to 16 or 24 hours for specific tasks like guarding property or in fire brigades, with the settlement period remaining one month. However, the 8-hour daily limit applies to employees exposed to hazardous substances, pregnant women, and those caring for children under four, unless they consent otherwise. Implementing this system requires agreement with trade unions or employee notification through a notice, with changes taking effect 14 days after announcement. It necessitates detailed work schedules outlining daily hours, workdays, and days off, with compensatory days off provided for Sunday or holiday work, and schedules communicated at least a week in advance.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_598" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_598" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_598" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_599" style="display:none;">Company mergers are a broad topic, but often crucial for many businesses. This article, split into two parts, focuses on choosing the correct merger method and highlights key related issues. This section discusses mergers using the acquisition method, and the prior article covers mergers via the pooling of interests method.<br><br>According to accounting law, commercial companies can merge using either the acquisition method, where the acquired company's assets transfer to the acquiring or newly formed company, or the pooling of interests method, used when existing shareholders retain control post-merger. The nature of the merger dictates the method for financial reporting.<br><br>The acquisition method involves summing the acquiring company's assets and liabilities at their book value with the acquired company's assets and liabilities at their fair value on the merger date. The acquired company's equity at the merger date, calculated as net assets at fair value, is excluded. Mutual debts, obligations, and other settlements between the merging companies are also excluded.<br><br>Fair value is specifically defined in accounting law for balance sheet components, such as quoted securities being their current price less sale costs, receivables being their discounted present value, and inventories being net sale price less profit margin.<br><br>The acquisition price is defined by law. Examples include the purchase price of treasury shares when acquired for the purpose of the merger, the price of shares in the acquired company, or the fair value of the payment when other than cash or shares.<br><br>If the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the acquired company's net assets, goodwill arises, recognized as an asset and amortized over its economic life (up to 5 years if economic life is indeterminable), with amortization expenses shown as other operating costs. If the acquisition price is lower than the fair value, negative goodwill arises and is recognized as deferred income over the weighted average economic life of the depreciable assets acquired, or, above a certain value, it is recognized immediately as other operating income.<br><br>Direct merger-related costs increase the acquisition price, while costs of establishing a new joint-stock company or increasing share capital reduce the acquiring company's retained earnings (up to the excess of issue value over nominal share value), with the remainder treated as financial expenses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_599" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_599" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_599" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_600" style="display:none;">Under Polish law, employers generally cannot terminate employment contracts with employees on any type of leave or with justified absences. However, maternity leave has specific rules. Pregnant employees are protected from termination during pregnancy and maternity leave under Article 177 of the Labor Code, unless they voluntarily consent to it. An employer learning of an employee's pregnancy must not dismiss her, except in strictly defined circumstances. If a pregnancy dismissal occurs without valid grounds, the employee can seek reinstatement through legal action, which is crucial for securing maternity benefits as employment on the day of childbirth is required.<br><br>Exceptions allowing dismissal of a pregnant employee include company liquidation or bankruptcy, where the employee remains entitled to pregnancy benefits and maternity leave. Dismissal for serious misconduct, such as acting against the company's interests or unexcused absence, is also permissible regardless of pregnancy. While group dismissals due to employer-side reasons cannot lead to termination of a pregnant employee, their contract terms, like salary or employment status, can be changed.<br><br>If an employer unknowingly dismisses a pregnant employee without evidence of her condition, the employee must inform the employer. If a pregnancy is discovered during the notice period, the employer must withdraw the dismissal upon request. The same applies if the employee resigns and later discovers pregnancy. Pregnancy during a notice period also grants the right to withdraw the notice. If an employee discovers pregnancy after the notice period or contract termination, she may still be eligible for reinstatement. Protection against job loss begins from the first day of pregnancy, with the conception date being the determining factor for eligibility, not the date of discovery. Miscarriage after receiving a dismissal notice does not automatically void it; a new dismissal notice is required after the post-miscarriage protection period ends.<br><br>Contracts for pregnant employees are automatically extended until the expected date of childbirth if the contract expires during pregnancy and the employee is at least 12 weeks pregnant. This extension does not count towards limits for fixed-term contracts converting to indefinite ones. However, this extension does not apply to temporary replacements, contracts shorter than one month, or if the contract ends before the 12th week of pregnancy. For "umowa zlecenie" (mandate contracts), pregnancy does not grant dismissal protection or automatic contract extension. Maternity benefits are available if voluntary sickness insurance contributions were paid for at least 12 months prior to childbirth, provided the individual was still employed on the day of birth.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_600" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_600" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_600" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_601" style="display:none;">An industrial consumer is a business operating in specific industrial sectors, such as mining, plastics processing, wood or cork production (excluding furniture), paper manufacturing, and metal processing. A defining characteristic is a high electricity intensity ratio, meaning energy costs constitute a significant portion of overall expenses. To determine if a business qualifies as an industrial consumer, it must identify if its activities fall under the specified industries and assess its annual electricity consumption.<br><br>Industrial consumers can benefit from implementing renewable energy sources (RES) by reducing electricity-related fees, particularly those associated with RES. Savings apply to both energy purchase and distribution costs. The extent of financial benefits from RES discounts depends on the electricity intensity ratio. Higher energy consumption translates to a larger share of RES-related fees and, consequently, a greater financial relief. Discounts are tiered based on the electricity intensity ratio: 20% (3-20% ratio), 40% (20-40% ratio), and 85% (above 40% ratio). For example, a company using 5 GWh of RES energy annually can save tens of thousands of Polish zlotys per year through the RES discount.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_601" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_601" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_601" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_602" style="display:none;">The "Polish Deal" program introduces the concept of a VAT Group, a financially, economically, and organizationally linked group of entities registered as a VAT taxpayer. Transactions between members of the same VAT Group are not subject to VAT. Conversely, transactions with entities outside the group are considered to be made by the VAT Group itself. A VAT Group can be formed by entities based in or operating in Poland through a branch.<br><br>Additionally, the law allows for accelerated VAT refunds within 15 days under specific conditions. These include submitting a VAT return showing a refund or a corrective return before the filing deadline, or submitting a corrective return after the deadline if it still indicates a refund.<br><br>To qualify for an accelerated refund, taxpayers must meet several criteria. These involve demonstrating a high percentage (at least 80%) of sales recorded through cash registers and payments made via payment instruments recorded through cash registers over specified periods. There are also sales value thresholds (at least PLN 50,000 per period for 12 consecutive months) and limitations on the VAT refund amount (not exceeding twice the VAT on sales recorded via cash registers). Furthermore, taxpayers must have been actively registered for VAT for at least 12 months, filed all VAT returns, used compatible cash registers, and held an account on the "white list" for three consecutive months prior to the refund application. The total sales value is determined based on data from the Central Register of Cash Registers, excluding sales documented by invoices but recorded in daily fiscal reports. Compliance with these conditions is verified using information from the National Tax Administration.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_602" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_602" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_602" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_605" style="display:none;">**Thin Capitalization**<br><br>The act introduces changes to thin capitalization rules. Article 15c of the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act will be amended, requiring taxpayers to exclude financing costs from their deductible expenses to the extent that the excess financing costs exceed either PLN 3,000,000 or 30% of the tax EBITDA. The current ability to sum these limits will be abolished. Furthermore, the scope of non-deductible expenses will be broadened. Article 16 of the CIT Act will be updated to stipulate that financing costs incurred from related parties, when directly or indirectly allocated to capital transactions such as share acquisitions, contributions, or treasury stock repurchases, will not be considered deductible.<br><br>**Rescission of Article 15e of the CIT Act**<br><br>The act also repeals Article 15e of the CIT Act. This article previously mandated the exclusion of intangible service costs (e.g., advisory, advertising, guarantee) incurred for related parties or from tax havens, if a statutory limit was exceeded. The repeal is a consequence of the introduction of a new concept: the minimum CIT.<br><br>**Minimum Income Tax**<br><br>A minimum income tax mechanism is introduced for CIT taxpayers and capital groups that incur losses from non-capital gain sources or where income from non-capital gain sources does not exceed 1% of their total revenue. These entities will be subject to a 10% tax rate on their tax base. Exceptions are provided for new businesses and those experiencing a significant revenue decline.<br><br>**Hidden Dividend**<br><br>The act redefines "hidden dividend." Costs incurred by a company from related parties or shareholders will be non-deductible if they are linked to the taxpayer's profit realization or amount, or if a rational taxpayer would not have incurred such costs or could have paid less for a comparable service from an unrelated party. This also includes remuneration for the use of assets previously owned by a shareholder or related entity. These provisions will take effect from January 1, 2023.<br><br>**Withholding Tax (WHT) Changes**<br><br>The criteria for assessing due diligence in WHT are expanded to include the relationships between the taxpayer and the payer, in addition to the taxpayer's business activities. The "pay and refund" mechanism will be narrowed, applying only to specific income types paid to non-residents by related entities, unless the payer provides a declaration of due diligence and lack of knowledge suggesting circumstances that would preclude the application of reduced rates or exemptions.<br><br>---<br><br>The implemented changes in Polish tax law introduce significant shifts in how companies are taxed. Thin capitalization rules are tightened, disallowing the combined use of the PLN 3 million and 30% EBITDA limits for interest deductibility, and extending non-deductible financing costs to capital transactions. Article 15e, concerning non-deductible intangible service costs, is repealed due to the introduction of a minimum CIT. This new minimum CIT will apply to loss-making companies or those with very low income from non-capital gain sources, taxing them at 10%. The concept of "hidden dividend" is clarified, making costs non-deductible if they are tied to profit, unreasonable, or relate to assets previously held by shareholders. Withholding tax rules are also updated, expanding due diligence assessments and narrowing the "pay and refund" mechanism, with specific exceptions for payers providing proper documentation and assurances. These reforms aim to ensure greater tax compliance and revenue collection.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_605" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_605" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_605" style="display:none;"></p>

However, for periods of hospitalization, it will be 70% of the calculation basis. Starting from the new year, this will increase to 80% regardless of whether the individual is hospitalized or at home.<br><br>The calculation basis for benefits will also be determined differently. It will not be recalculated if there was no break or a break shorter than one calendar month between periods of receiving benefits (regardless of type).

Entrepreneurs can claim sickness insurance benefits even if contributions are paid late, provided the debt does not exceed 1% of the minimum wage (PLN 30 from January 2021) on the day the right to the benefit arises. Otherwise, the benefit will not be granted until the debt is settled. Furthermore, the right to the benefit will expire if arrears are not cleared within 6 months of the benefit's entitlement date.<br><br>Benefit Period<br><br>The standard benefit period is 182 days, extending to 270 days if the incapacity for work is due to tuberculosis or occurs during pregnancy. This period includes all uninterrupted periods of incapacity. Currently, if there are breaks in incapacity, the preceding incapacity is included if caused by the same condition and the break does not exceed 60 days. From January, the cause of incapacity before and after a break will be irrelevant; the period of incapacity will be counted the same, regardless of whether it's the same or different illnesses. Under the law, benefits for incapacity following the cessation of insurance title are limited to 91 days, with no changes for tuberculosis or pregnancy-related incapacity.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>New regulations in Poland are adjusting sickness and maternity benefits. The sickness benefit will increase to 80% of the calculation basis for all recipients, including those hospitalized, effective from the new year. The method for calculating the benefit basis is also being revised to avoid frequent recalculations during short breaks between benefit periods. Maternity benefit rights are being protected for women who give birth after their insurance ends due to employer insolvency or legal breaches, provided they are not offered new employment.<br><br>Crucially, self-employed individuals and those paying their own contributions can now receive sickness benefits even with late payments, as long as the overdue amount is below 1% of the minimum wage. However, benefits will be withheld until full payment if the debt exceeds this threshold, and the right to benefits will lapse if arrears are not cleared within six months. The calculation of the total benefit period is also being simplified, with the cause of incapacity before and after a break becoming irrelevant for accumulating the total entitlement. The standard benefit period remains 182 days, extending to 270 for specific conditions, and a 91-day limit applies after insurance termination.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_606" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_606" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_606" style="display:none;"></p>

The statutory auditor acts primarily as an observer during the inventory count, verifying that the process adheres to inventory regulations and instructions. They ensure that inventory documentation is correctly completed and that the actual inventory on hand is complete and in good condition. This role is crucial as inventory often constitutes a major portion of a company's assets.<br><br>The auditor's primary objective in participating in inventory is to gather sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the existence and condition of inventory. Their presence allows them to confirm the physical existence of inventory within the entity. As per auditing standard ISA 501, if inventory is material, the auditor obtains evidence by being present during the physical count to assess inventory counting procedures, observe the counting process, test the inventory, and perform test counts. They also perform procedures on the final inventory listing to ensure it accurately reflects the physical count results.<br><br>If physical presence is not feasible, alternative procedures may be employed, such as inspecting post-inventory sales documentation for specific items purchased before the count date. However, alternative procedures cannot confirm the existence of inventory. In such cases, online participation via video conference is a viable, albeit last resort, option to fulfill the auditor's obligations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_607" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_607" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_607" style="display:none;"></p>

Positive perceptions of women in leadership are particularly strong in small and medium-sized enterprises, where women hold 38% of top management positions, the highest in Europe.<br><br>However, the survey also revealed that half of female respondents feel women are better suited for specialist roles than management. This suggests that women themselves may perpetuate stereotypes, hindering their own advancement. Stereotypes, rather than outright prejudice, lead women to abandon aspirations for leadership or tolerate pay inequality. The article also distinguishes the "glass ceiling" from "sticky floors" (where career progression is impossible due to profession or company structure) and "glass escalators" (where men in female-dominated fields receive faster promotions). Ultimately, the text encourages individuals to seek environments where advancement is based on merit, not gender, highlighting Moore Polska as an example with 67% of top management roles held by women.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_608" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_608" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_608" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_609" style="display:none;">**Employment of Foreigners from Outside the European Union**<br><br>Foreigners from non-EU/EEA countries can legally work in Poland if they possess a work permit and a valid residence permit (visa or temporary residence permit) that allows for employment. The primary responsibility for obtaining a work permit lies with the prospective employer, who must submit an application to the relevant Voivodeship Office, often requiring a labor market test indicating a lack of local candidates.<br><br>A simplified procedure allows certain foreigners, including citizens of Ukraine, to work for up to 6 months within a 12-month period based on a registered employer's statement filed with the district labor office. This streamlined process bypasses the labor market test for specific nationalities like Ukrainians, Armenians, Belarusians, Georgians, Moldovans, and Russians, provided they have a written employment agreement and the employer has registered their intention to employ the foreigner.<br><br>Citizens from EU/EEA countries and Switzerland enjoy free movement and do not require work permits or visas to work in Poland. They only need to register their stay if it exceeds three months.<br><br>Several exceptions exist where foreigners can work without a permit, including those with refugee status, permanent residence permits, or certain temporary residence permits for highly qualified employment or studies. Holders of a Polish Card or spouses of Polish citizens also benefit from relaxed regulations.<br><br>The employment of foreigners who have applied for an extension of their stay or work permit is considered legal until a decision is made, provided the application was submitted correctly and on time. Employers must verify the legal status of their foreign employees by requesting and retaining copies of relevant documents. Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to significant penalties, including fines and even imprisonment in severe cases of illegal employment.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Legally employing a foreigner from outside the EU/EEA in Poland generally requires a work permit obtained by the employer, often contingent on a labor market test. Ukrainian citizens and individuals from several other Eastern European countries can benefit from a simplified procedure allowing work for up to six months based on a registered employer's statement, bypassing the labor market test. Citizens of EU/EEA countries and Switzerland have unrestricted access to the Polish labor market due to freedom of movement, needing only to register stays exceeding three months. Various other categories of foreigners are exempt from work permit requirements, including refugees, permanent residents, and those with specific temporary permits related to highly skilled work, studies, or family ties. The process of extending work permits and residence allows for continued legal employment during the application period. Employers bear the responsibility of verifying foreign employees' legal status and must retain copies of their permits. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in substantial penalties for employers.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_609" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_609" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_609" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_613" style="display:none;">In the EU, individuals are generally subject to the social security laws of only one member state. If a foreign company employs someone in Poland, that employee typically falls under the Polish social security system (ZUS). The foreign company, as the employer, must register with ZUS. This requires obtaining a NIP (tax identification number) from the Second Tax Office in Warsaw-Śródmieście, submitting necessary documents including a NIP-2 form, a cover letter, and a certified translation of the company's registration extract. After obtaining the NIP, the employer is registered with ZUS using forms ZUS ZPA and a copy of the NIP decision. Employees are then registered using form ZUS ZUA. Monthly declarations and contributions are due by the 15th of the following month.<br><br>Alternatively, ZUS allows the employee to assume the employer's obligations. This requires a written agreement, and the employee registers with ZUS using forms ZUS ZUA/ZZA, ZUS ZAA, and copies of the agreement and their own NIP decision, taking responsibility for payments and declarations. These regulations also apply to Switzerland and the EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway). For companies outside the EU, Switzerland, and the EEA, social security obligations depend on existing agreements between Poland and the company's country of origin.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_613" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_613" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_613" style="display:none;"></p>

The acquisition method applies when the acquired company's assets transfer to the acquiring or newly formed company. The pooling of interests method is used when the original shareholders retain control after the merger.<br><br>The pooling of interests method, often used for merging subsidiaries under common control or lower-level parent entities with subsidiaries, involves summing the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of the combined entities as of the merger date, followed by specific exclusions. This summation requires verifying that financial statement items are presented using uniform valuation principles. Exclusions include the capital of the transferred company, mutual debts, receivables, similar settlements, reciprocal income and expenses, and mutual profits and losses from pre-merger transactions. The materiality principle guides the elimination of mutual transactions, allowing for non-exclusion if it doesn't compromise the financial statement's reliability.<br><br>Costs associated with the merger, such as advisory and legal fees, along with new company formation and capital increase costs, are treated as period costs and reported as financial expenses.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_616" style="display:none;">The Polish "Tarcza 4.0" law of June 19, 2020, addresses remote work regulations but lacks clarity, particularly regarding accidents during remote work and cost allocation for employees working outside the office. The law doesn't mandate employers to reimburse remote work expenses, although they must provide adequate tools, materials, and logistical support. Reimbursement for electricity or internet costs is not obligatory. Employers cover installation, service, and maintenance of equipment, but increased internet usage or higher bills due to remote work are discretionary expenses for the employer. This stems from the distinction between remote work and telework, where, under the Labor Code, employers *are* required to cover such costs for teleworkers. Reimbursements for necessary work-related equipment do not generate taxable income for the employee. Forthcoming changes aim to establish cost reimbursement rules within internal company regulations.<br><br>Communication with employers is crucial to avoid misunderstandings, as Polish law permits, but doesn't mandate, employers to provide appropriate compensation without tax implications. Remote work offers advantages such as saving time and money on commuting, promoting environmental awareness, and providing flexibility for better work-life balance. While remote work is beneficial, consulting with professionals for further informations is a good way to get a deeper understanding.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_616" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_616" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_616" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_620" style="display:none;">**VAT Group**<br><br>The VAT group, proposed under the Polish Deal program, operates in 18 EU countries and is enabled by the VAT Directive (2006/112/WE). It aims to allow financially, economically, and organizationally linked entities to settle VAT jointly, functioning as a single VAT taxpayer. Internal transactions within the VAT group are not subject to VAT, ensuring tax neutrality. Transactions with entities outside the group are treated as if they are with the entire group. The split payment mechanism is excluded for intra-group turnovers. Entities based in Poland or conducting business in Poland through a branch can form a VAT group by entering into a written agreement.<br><br>**Accelerated VAT Refund**<br><br>To promote cashless transactions, taxpayers can receive a VAT refund within 15 days if they meet specific criteria, including a high proportion of payments made using payment instruments. Failure to accept cashless payments may result in temporary exclusion from certain tax preferences, such as quarterly settlements and the right to a 25-day VAT refund.<br><br>**Taxation of Financial Services**<br><br>Financial services are generally VAT-exempt, but the VAT Directive allows for optional taxation. The proposed regulations offer taxpayers the choice to tax financial services provided exclusively to other VAT taxpayers. Services to non-VAT taxpayers remain VAT-exempt. This aims to increase VAT neutrality in the financial sector by granting the right to deduct input tax on purchases related to providing these services. Taxpayers opting out of the exemption must tax all financial services provided to taxpayers for a minimum of two years. They must also notify the tax office and register as an active VAT payer to apply this taxation option.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_620" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_620" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_620" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_621" style="display:none;">On August 4, 2021, a new draft law amending the VAT Act and some other acts (UD159) was published, implementing the National e-Invoice System (KSeF) and enabling the issuance and receipt of structured invoices through it. Initially planned for October 1, 2021, the effective date is now proposed for January 1, 2022.<br><br>KSeF is designed as an IT system for receiving and storing structured invoices. It will assign a unique identification number to each invoice and verify its compliance with the structured invoice template. An invoice is considered issued and delivered on the day the system assigns it an ID number. While the use of KSeF will be voluntary initially, mandatory electronic invoicing is planned for all entities from 2023.<br><br>To facilitate timely adaptation, the Ministry of Finance has published a working version of the e-Invoice logical structure and sample files. The logical structure will eventually be published on the e-PUAP platform.<br><br>Incentives for using KSeF include faster VAT refunds (40 days instead of 60), subject to conditions like issuing only structured invoices during the entire settlement period and being an active VAT payer for over 12 months, and not exceeding 3000 PLN. Receiving structured invoices via KSeF requires recipient consent; otherwise, the issuer must provide it in another agreed-upon manner. Corrections to structured invoices can only be made through KSeF. Currently, VAT RR and pro forma invoices cannot be issued in KSeF. Taxpayers who opt for KSeF are exempt from the 10-year invoice storage and archiving obligation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_621" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_621" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_621" style="display:none;"></p>

It is being prepared by the Ministry of Health. Its goal is to support actions that ensure protection in workplaces where coronavirus infections occur.<br><br>Thus, the proposed regulation would introduce solutions allowing employers to obtain certain information about the health status of employees.

It is also not known how long the employer will be able to send an employee on unpaid leave. It is also not known whether it will be possible to hire a replacement for an employee on unpaid leave at the employer's request.

Another unknown is how the employer should interpret an employee's refusal to provide information about their health - in this case, for example, vaccination.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>A proposed amendment to Poland's COVID-19 law aims to bolster workplace safety by granting employers access to employees' vaccination, infection history, and test results. This would allow employers to manage unvaccinated, non-recovered, or untested individuals. Employers could mandate unpaid leave, preventing termination, or reassign employees to remote or alternative tasks, potentially affecting pay. New hires could also be required to provide health information. Key uncertainties remain: whether these provisions are employer obligations or rights, the duration of unpaid leave, and the possibility of hiring replacements. The lack of clarity also extends to employees with medical vaccine exemptions and those who refuse to disclose health data. The potential loss of income and insurance during unpaid leave raises concerns.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_622" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_622" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_622" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_623" style="display:none;">Valuing a business goes beyond just numbers; it's about understanding the story behind them. Professor Aswath Damodaran emphasizes that business valuation is "history plus numbers." The author's experience confirms that similar-looking financial figures can lead to different valuations depending on the company's narrative. Three key questions should be addressed for a reliable valuation: who is the intended recipient, which valuation method is most appropriate, and what other factors accompany the transaction. Always review the valuation result with common sense and consider multiples.<br><br>The person paying isn't always the one who dictates the valuation. Consider the perspective of the counterparty, whether it's a minority shareholder or an external investor. Focus on what the business is worth today, not what an investor might transform it into. Be aware of what holds value for you might not for an investor.<br><br>There are three core approaches: asset-based, income-based, and market-based valuation. Asset-based valuation measures the historical effect on assets, often readily available in a company's balance sheet, especially the equity, which can be used as a benchmark. Income-based valuation assesses future free cash flows, though susceptible to manipulation. Market-based valuation uses comparable transactions but is most reliable in an active market. Each method has its place depending on the company's circumstances and available information.<br><br>Beyond numbers, understanding the source of success and potential weaknesses is crucial. The role of the owner and realistic growth opportunities can dramatically alter a valuation. Multiples, such as revenue or EBITDA, serve as a sanity check. The real valuation is based on a true understanding of the business and its advantages. Be open-minded and consult with experts who can offer a comprehensive perspective.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_623" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_623" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_623" style="display:none;"></p>

This package follows the initial SLIM VAT introduced in late 2020.<br><br>Key changes include VAT deduction rules for intra-community acquisitions and service imports. The new rules allow for deducting input VAT in the same period the tax obligation arose, provided the taxpayer reports the output VAT in the corresponding tax return. This change reflects a recent EU Court of Justice ruling.<br><br>Regarding the split payment mechanism, taxpayers can now transfer funds between VAT accounts in different banks. However, releasing funds from the VAT account to a regular account still requires approval from tax authorities. The tax office can approve such release even with tax arrears if the taxpayer has a deferred payment or installment agreement.<br><br>SLIM VAT 2 also simplifies VAT corrections, enabling taxpayers to deduct VAT "on an ongoing basis" after the deadline by expanding the number of reporting periods in which a correction can be made. Other changes include extending the bad debt relief period from two to three years, clarifying which supply in chain transactions is attributed to shipment/transport based on which entity is responsible, and allowing suppliers and buyers to jointly declare their choice of real estate taxation in the notarial deed.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_624" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_624" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_624" style="display:none;"></p>

Key principles include no need to amend employment contracts, temporary assignment, and informing employees about work procedures.<br><br>The biggest challenge is potential workplace accidents during remote work, often underestimated by employers. The lack of clear regulations complicates safety compliance. Employers are responsible for workplace accidents under the labor code and occupational health and safety (BHP) rules. The Chief Labor Inspectorate (GIP) may choose not to investigate remote work accidents but doesn't absolve employers from determining accident causes and preparing post-accident reports.<br><br>Employees are always entitled to ZUS accident insurance benefits. Employers may face civil liability, especially when they lack control over remote work conditions. Implementing internal regulations like remote work instructions, outlining basic duties and risk analysis, is the safest approach for employers.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_626" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_626" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_626" style="display:none;"></p>

However, simultaneously, additional penal fiscal sanctions are planned. Key changes include:<br><br>Exemptions from Documentation: Transactions between Polish branches of foreign companies, transactions covered by tax or investment agreements, safe harbor transactions for loans, and pure re-invoicing (meeting specific criteria such as no value-added, no mark-up, no allocation keys, unrelated to other controlled transactions, immediate settlement, and no transactions with tax havens) are exempt.<br><br>Transfer Pricing Adjustments: Taxpayers can apply downward adjustments if they receive accounting evidence confirming the transfer pricing correction from a related party. The obligation to report transfer pricing corrections in the annual tax return is removed.<br><br>Extended Deadlines: The deadline for submitting transfer pricing documentation upon request is extended to 14 days. The deadline for preparing local transfer pricing documentation is extended to the end of the 10th month after the tax year's end. The deadline for submitting transfer pricing information (TPR) is extended to the end of the 11th month after the tax year's end.<br><br>Analyses: Exemptions from comparability/conformity analyses are available for controlled transactions involving micro/small enterprises, non-controlled transactions with tax havens, and transactions meeting safe harbor criteria for low-value services.<br><br>Penal Fiscal Code Sanctions: Failure to prepare or inaccurate preparation of transfer pricing documentation or information carries a fine of up to 720 daily rates (up to PLN 26.9 million). Late submission results in a fine of up to 240 daily rates (up to PLN 8.9 million).<br><br>Other Changes: VAT must be included in the value of a controlled transaction if the taxpayer has limited or no right to deduct it. The separate statement regarding the preparation of transfer pricing documentation and the market conformity of transfer prices is eliminated; this statement is incorporated into the TPR form. The TPR form must be signed by the head of the unit (as defined by accounting law) and by an authorized representative (procurator or professional attorney). The obligation to prepare and submit the ORD-U form is waived for taxpayers required to submit transfer pricing information (except for taxpayers conducting transactions with tax havens). Documentation obligations are now linked to the taxpayer's tax year instead of the accounting year.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_627" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_627" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_627" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_628" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>Therefore, from January 1, 2022, the only form of taxation for income (revenue) derived from so-called private rentals will be a flat-rate tax on recorded revenue. This, in turn, may cause private rentals to become less profitable after the introduction of tax changes.<br><br>CURRENT RULES<br><br>Currently, according to the PIT Act, the taxpayer has the right to choose the taxation of income from so-called private rental. The first option is taxation according to general rules (tax scale). In this situation, the taxpayer determines the revenue they earn and deducts from it the costs associated with the property (e.g., property insurance, renovation, furnishings, loan interest, and property tax). From the income thus obtained, they pay PIT tax according to the scale, i.e., 17% or 32%. The second method is taxation based on a flat-rate tax on recorded revenue. According to the rates in force in 2021, the flat-rate tax on recorded revenue is 8.5% of revenue up to PLN 100,000 per year and 12.5% of revenue exceeding this amount.<br><br>In the case of renting residential premises conducted as part of business activity, it is also possible to use a flat rate or taxation according to the scale or taxation at a flat rate of 19%.<br><br>Taxpayers incurring significant costs related to the rented property may not show taxable income or show income in a small amount under the current legal status.<br><br>PLANNED NEW RULES - POLISH DEAL<br><br>The draft regulations assume that from January 1, 2022, the only form of taxation of taxpayers' income from so-called private rental will be a flat-rate tax on recorded revenue. As a result, the possibility of choosing between taxation of rental income with a recorded flat rate and general rules will disappear. In addition, taxpayers will lose the ability to reduce the tax base by the costs associated with obtaining this income, because the taxation will be based not on income, but on the landlord's revenue from the lease. Furthermore, it should be noted that with flat-rate taxation, it is not possible to take advantage of the tax-free amount, which from January 1, 2022, is to be PLN 30,000.<br><br>At the same time, the project excludes depreciation deductions for residential buildings and premises rented as part of so-called private rental and as part of business activity from tax-deductible expenses.<br><br>Information on other tax changes under the Polish Deal project can be found HERE.<br><br>If you are interested in details regarding the above changes, please contact us.<br><br>rental, taxes, Polish Deal<br><br>Feel free to contact us<br><br>agnieszka.drozdz-wilk@moorepolska.pl<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>From January 1, 2022, the "Polish Deal" legislation will mandate a flat-rate tax on recorded revenue as the sole method for taxing income from private rentals in Poland. This eliminates the option of using general taxation rules, potentially reducing profitability for landlords. Currently, landlords can choose between general rules (17% or 32% tax on income after deducting costs) or a flat-rate tax (8.5% on revenue up to PLN 100,000, and 12.5% above). The change means landlords can no longer deduct property-related expenses like insurance or mortgage interest, and cannot avail of the tax-free allowance of 30,000 PLN. The new rules also prevent depreciation deductions for rental properties, impacting both private and business rentals. This shift is significant because it taxes gross revenue rather than net income, potentially increasing the tax burden for landlords who previously benefited from deductible expenses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_628" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_628" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_628" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_629" style="display:none;">The minimum wage in Poland is subject to annual negotiations within the Tripartite Labour Council. By June 15th each year, the Council of Ministers is obligated to present a proposal for the next year's minimum wage to the Council. In 2021, this deadline was missed, necessitating the government to set the minimum wage through a regulation. A draft regulation proposing increases for 2022 was presented on July 16, 2021.<br><br>The Ministry of Development, Labour and Technology announced that the minimum wage for employees on standard employment contracts would increase by PLN 200 gross (7.1%) to PLN 3,000 gross in 2022. The minimum hourly rate for specific civil law contracts was proposed to rise by PLN 1.30 to PLN 19.60 gross. These changes are estimated to affect around 2.2 million workers. The estimated cost of this increase for 2022 is approximately PLN 5.24 billion for small and medium-sized enterprises and PLN 789 million for large entities. For an employee under 26, working in their place of residence, the net increase after tax relief and excluding PPK contributions would be PLN 141.05, bringing their take-home pay to PLN 2,202.72. For employers, the cost associated with such an employee would increase by about PLN 240. Employers have largely accepted the government's proposal, though trade unions had advocated for a higher minimum wage of PLN 3,500 gross. The final agreement deadline for setting the minimum wage is September 15, 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_629" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_629" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_629" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_630" style="display:none;">When hiring part-time employees, calculating their annual leave entitlement can be challenging. According to the Polish Labour Code (Art. 154§2), leave is granted on working days according to the employee's schedule, measured in hours corresponding to their daily working time. One day of leave is equivalent to 8 hours of work.<br><br>For part-time employees, the leave entitlement is calculated proportionally to their working hours. Any fractional part of a day is rounded up to a full day. It's important to note that each leave day deducts the actual number of hours the employee would have worked. Employee tenure also plays a significant role, influencing the overall leave allowance.<br><br>The article provides specific examples for various part-time fractions (1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 7/8 of full-time) and distinguishes between employees with less than 10 years of service and those with over 20 years. For instance, a 1/4 time employee with less than 10 years of service is entitled to 40 hours of leave annually (5 days of 8 hours), while a 1/4 time employee with over 20 years gets 56 hours (7 days of 8 hours), assuming a 5-day work week with 2-hour shifts. Similar calculations are presented for other part-time ratios, highlighting how increased seniority translates to more total leave hours. For specific queries, individuals are encouraged to contact the provided expert.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_630" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_630" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_630" style="display:none;"></p>

However, well-prepared consolidation documentation offers numerous advantages and improvements.<br><br>Is consolidation documentation mandatory? Yes, under Polish law, the parent entity is obligated to prepare and update consolidation documentation. This is not optional.<br><br>What should consolidation documentation include? While the law provides a general outline due to the diverse nature of group transactions, it typically encompasses: financial statements of consolidated entities, adjusted statements of subsidiaries according to consolidation accounting policies, statements of subsidiaries translated into Polish Zloty, all consolidation adjustments and eliminations, calculations of fair value of net assets of subsidiaries, calculations of goodwill and impairment thereof, minority interest calculations, and calculations of exchange differences from foreign currency translations.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_634" style="display:none;">The amended Corporate Income Tax Act, specifically Article 15cb, allows for the inclusion of hypothetical interest on capital contributions and profits allocated to reserves as tax-deductible costs. This provision incentivizes companies to retain profits rather than relying solely on external financing, as interest on external debt typically reduces taxable income but represents an actual company expense.<br><br>Tax-deductible costs for capital acquisition are recognized when a resolution to transfer profit to reserves is passed, or for shareholder contributions, upon the funds' arrival in the company's bank account. These hypothetical interest amounts can be recognized as tax costs in the year of the resolution, the receipt of contributions, and the two subsequent tax years.<br><br>The regulation has conditions. A primary limit is PLN 250,000 for tax-deductible costs per taxpayer annually. Interest cannot be calculated on contributions intended to cover balance sheet losses. If shareholders receive a distribution of retained profits or have their capital contributions returned within three years from the end of the tax year in which the profit was retained or contributions were received, the tax benefit is lost, requiring correction of tax costs.<br><br>The deductible amount is calculated by multiplying the NBP reference rate from the last business day of the preceding year, increased by 1 percentage point, by the sum of capital contributions and profits allocated to reserves. The maximum hypothetical interest allowed as a tax-deductible cost offers a tax benefit of PLN 47,500 annually.<br><br>An anti-avoidance clause, effective from January 1, 2021, disallows the application of Article 15cb if the decision to retain profits or make capital contributions is primarily for tax benefits without sound economic reasons beyond taxation. This applies particularly to entities that historically paid dividends instead of retaining profits.<br><br>---<br><br>The amended Corporate Income Tax Act allows companies to deduct hypothetical interest on capital contributions and retained profits, simulating the cost of external financing. This encourages profit retention. Tax benefits are recognized upon resolutions for profit allocation or receipt of contributions and can be claimed for up to three years. Key conditions include an annual deduction limit of PLN 250,000 and a prohibition on using contributions for losses. Tax benefits are forfeited if retained profits are distributed or contributions are returned within three years. The deductible amount is based on a reference rate plus one percent, applied to contributions and retained profits.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_635" style="display:none;">Effective July 1, 2021, amendments to regulations concerning the detailed scope of data in VAT declarations and records come into force, impacting JPK VAT filings submitted for July (due August 25th). These changes are partially related to the e-commerce law also effective July 1st.<br><br>The new JPK_V7 introduces symbols like "WSTO_EE" for intra-community distance sales and telecom/broadcasting/electronic services to non-taxable entities, replacing "SW" and "EE." Intermediary platforms not registered in IOSS or OSS but responsible for VAT on non-EU shipments will use "IED."<br><br>Other key changes include: removing the mandatory "MPP" designation on both sales and purchases (though required on sales invoices); allowing aggregated reporting of simplified invoices (receipts with NIP under PLN 450 or EUR 100) and highway toll/single-ticket transport invoices, with separate JPK_FA reporting unchanged; mandating the reporting of payment/receipt dates for "bad debt relief" corrections. The regulation clarifies GTU code applications, referencing CN 2020 or PKWiU 2015 classifications, including GTU_12 for audit services (PKWiU 69.20.1). GTU codes are renumbered "GTU_01" to "GTU_13," are not used for "WEW" and "RO" transactions, and internal correction notes for input tax (art. 86 section 19a) can be reported via the "WEW" document in the absence of a correcting invoice. Procedures codes are waived for internal sales records "RO", and the "TP" designation is removed when connections between parties result only from ties to the State Treasury or local government.<br><br>Removing "MPP" is a positive simplification, but new obligations like reporting payment terms for bad debt relief are introduced.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_635" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_635" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_635" style="display:none;"></p>

Directive (EU) 2019/1158 introduces substantial modifications to parental rights, impacting parental leave and flexible work arrangements.<br><br>Key changes focus on fathers' parental leave entitlements. Firstly, fathers will gain an individual right to four months of parental leave, usable before the child turns eight, independent of the mother's entitlement. Currently, if a mother isn't eligible for parental leave, she cannot transfer this right to the father. Secondly, fathers will be allocated a non-transferable minimum of two months of parental leave. If not used, these two months will be forfeited.<br><br>These reforms aim to encourage fathers to utilize their parental leave, facilitate mothers' return to the workforce, and promote a more equal parenting model by increasing fathers' involvement in childcare.

Persistent non-compliance by partnerships may lead to dissolution or liquidation.<br><br>The company's management is responsible for electronically filing the financial statement with the KRS. Submitting late is a criminal offense, prosecuted against the manager, not the company. Properly filed statements require electronic signatures from the person managing the accounting records and the current management body members.

It argues that while an invisible, non-restrictive boundary might seem preferable, a well-defined, even "obstructed" one is crucial for the health of both the business and the family.<br><br>Failing to separate business time from family time, even with small, seemingly innocent concessions, can lead to the gradual erosion of personal boundaries. This can result in the business encroaching on family life, causing detriment to one or the other. The author suggests starting by maintaining a business-free atmosphere during important family occasions and gradually extending this to everyday conversations.<br><br>Drawing on the insights of David Bork, the text emphasizes defining clear roles, responsibilities, ownership, and private matters within a family business to prevent conflicts, much like precisely defined national borders prevent disputes. When a business consumes excessive family time due to disorganization, constant firefighting, or regulatory ignorance, it's a sign that boundaries are being crossed. The solution lies in organizing the business's core elements to reclaim time for family. The latter part of the text offers business consulting services to achieve this by assessing the company, auditing processes, managing costs and taxes, handling HR and legal matters, and developing client acquisition strategies.<br><br>The importance of clearly defined boundaries between a family business and personal life cannot be overstated. Just as good fences maintain good neighborly relations, clear divisions between work and family prevent conflicts and ensure the well-being of both spheres. While a subtle, unobtrusive boundary might seem ideal, a well-established, even guarded one is essential. Neglecting to set and maintain these boundaries, even through minor compromises, can lead to the business gradually encroaching on family time, ultimately jeopardizing one or both. Establishing a business-free environment during significant family events and extending this practice to everyday conversations is a practical approach. Defining roles, responsibilities, and private matters within a family business is crucial for preventing disputes, mirroring how clear national borders avert conflicts. When a business's disorganization leads to excessive demands on family time, it signifies a boundary breach. Organizing the business's core functions is key to reclaiming personal time for family. Professional consulting can aid in assessing the company, auditing operations, managing finances, and developing strategies to achieve this balance.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_639" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_639" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_639" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_640" style="display:none;">The VAT e-commerce package introduces EU-wide directives to combat VAT fraud in cross-border B2C e-commerce. Previously, sales below individual national thresholds (35,000-100,000 euros) could be taxed in the country of dispatch. The new package standardizes this threshold to 10,000 euros net across all EU member states. Sales exceeding this limit, based on the current and previous tax year's value, will now be taxed in the destination country. This lower threshold means more businesses will need to register for VAT in countries where they supply goods.<br><br>To simplify this, the VAT-OSS (One Stop Shop) procedure allows businesses to declare and pay VAT for all EU B2C transactions through a single VAT return in their home country, applying the destination country's VAT rates. Additionally, the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) simplifies VAT for imported goods valued up to 150 euros from outside the EU. Under IOSS, VAT is collected at the point of sale and declared in the member state of identification.<br><br>Furthermore, online platforms facilitating the sale of low-value imported goods (under 150 euros) or intra-EU distance sales are now considered to have received and supplied these goods themselves, making them responsible for collecting and remitting VAT.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_642" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Finance is planning to introduce "Slim VAT 2," a package of simplifications for Value Added Tax (VAT). These changes aim to streamline tax settlements by removing unnecessary formalities and outdated obligations, including provisions for the import of services.<br><br>Currently, input VAT on imported services can be deducted in the period the tax liability arises, provided it's settled within three months of the end of the month in which the liability occurred. Failure to do so results in paying the VAT due without deduction and incurring interest. A European Court of Justice ruling from March 18, 2021, concerning intra-Community acquisitions, highlighted inconsistencies with the EU's VAT system when declarations for tax due and deductible tax are made in different periods. Although this ruling specifically addressed intra-Community acquisitions, a similar mechanism applies to imported services, raising questions about potential conflicts with EU law.<br><br>The proposed changes would revert to the pre-2017 rules, allowing the settlement of both output and input VAT on imported services within the same tax return. Article 86, paragraph 1b of the VAT Act would be amended to remove the three-month condition. Additionally, taxpayers would gain the right to deduct input VAT not only in the period the liability arises but also in one of the three subsequent tax periods (or two for quarterly filers). This reform is expected to reduce the number of VAT return corrections, as seen in 2020 where over 55,000 taxpayers filed corrections, affecting over 1.3 million invoices. The proposed changes are under development, with some provisions of Slim VAT 2 potentially effective from October 1, 2021, and others from the beginning of 2022, contingent on successful legislative progression.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_642" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_642" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_642" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_643" style="display:none;">The concept of a family business is likened to a system of connected vessels. Increased pressure in one area, often stemming from stress, disappointment, or financial difficulties, inevitably disrupts the peace in another. Financial problems, in particular, can "radioactively" spread throughout the entire family. To prevent this, businesses must be built on solid foundations, using an analogy from construction.<br><br>Sand represents daily concentration on the business and profit, acknowledging that small, consistent actions build a lasting foundation. However, sand alone is insufficient; it requires other components. Lime symbolizes strict cost control, plugging financial leaks. Cement represents customers, the essential binder that connects all business segments. Satisfied customers are effective advertising and reduce costs, as retaining them is cheaper than acquiring new ones.<br><br>Water represents employees and all individuals supporting the business. Providing them with stable employment fosters loyalty and a committed workforce.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_644" style="display:none;">What is a Management Report and Who is Obligated to Prepare It?<br><br>A management report is a descriptive and numerical document designed to enrich and supplement knowledge about an entity. It provides information about the company's operations, intentions, and development prospects.<br><br>According to Article 49 of the Accounting Act, the management of a capital company, a joint-stock limited partnership, a mutual insurance company, as well as general partnerships and limited partnerships where all partners with unlimited liability are capital companies, joint-stock limited partnerships, or companies from other countries with a similar legal form, is obligated to prepare a management report along with the annual financial statements.<br><br>What Information Should a Management Report Contain?<br><br>Guidelines for the content of a management report are provided not only by the Accounting Act but also by National Accounting Standard No. 9 "Management Report." The legislator mandates that the report should include at least the following elements: events significantly impacting the entity during the financial year and up to the approval of the financial statements; anticipated development of the entity; significant achievements in research and development; current and anticipated financial situation; company branches; information on financial instruments, particularly risks (price changes, credit, significant cash flow disruptions, and liquidity loss), and the entity's financial risk management objectives and methods, including hedging. Information on own shares, including reasons for acquisition, number and nominal value of shares sold and acquired, and their accounting value, is also required.<br><br>If relevant for assessing the company's results and development, the report should also contain key financial and non-financial performance indicators, as well as information regarding employee and environmental matters.<br><br>Who Signs the Management Report and When is it Made Available?<br><br>The management report is prepared in Polish currency and the Polish language, covering the same period as the financial statements. It is signed by the unit's management, or all members if it is a multi-person governing body. Refusal to sign requires a written justification attached to the report. As per KSR No. 9, the management report is made available concurrently with the financial statements and within the same timeframe.<br><br>A management report is a comprehensive document providing a dual perspective on an entity's activities and future outlook. It is mandated for specific types of companies, including capital companies and certain partnerships where all unlimited liability partners are corporate entities. The report must detail significant events impacting the company, its developmental plans, R&D achievements, financial standing, and operational aspects like branches and financial instruments. Crucially, it must address financial risks such as price changes, credit risk, cash flow disruptions, and liquidity, alongside the entity's strategies for managing these risks and hedging transactions. Information on treasury shares, including acquisition rationale and transaction details, is also a mandatory component. Beyond financial data, the report should encompass key financial and non-financial performance indicators, as well as employee and environmental considerations if they are material to assessing the company's performance and development. The report, prepared in Polish, is signed by the management and released concurrently with the financial statements.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_644" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_644" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_644" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_645" style="display:none;">RAISING THE TAX-FREE AMOUNT<br><br>The Personal Income Tax (PIT) tax-free amount is proposed to be increased to PLN 30,000 annually for all taxpayers. Currently, the tax-free amount varies based on income levels, standing at PLN 3,089 for incomes between PLN 13,000-85,000 and decreasing to PLN 0 for annual incomes exceeding PLN 127,000. It also does not currently apply to income from business activities taxed at a flat rate.<br><br>HIGHER TAX BRACKET<br><br>For taxpayers whose income is subject to the tax scale, the 32% tax rate would apply to income exceeding PLN 120,000, compared to the current threshold of PLN 85,528.<br><br>HEALTH CONTRIBUTION BASED ON INCOME<br><br>Previously, entrepreneurs could pay insurance contributions based on a declared base amount, effectively resulting in a lump-sum health contribution. The proposed change mandates that individuals engaged in business activities pay health contributions proportionally to their income, similar to employees. This change also eliminates the option to deduct health contributions from tax.<br><br>The planned reforms aim to reduce tax burdens for individuals earning up to approximately PLN 11,000 gross per month (for employment contracts) and PLN 6,000 gross per month (for business activities). Those earning above these figures will face higher combined PIT and health contribution payments.<br><br>CHANGES IN VAT<br><br>Intra-group settlements within capital groups will not be subject to VAT, and financial transactions may become subject to VAT.<br><br>CHANGES IN CIT<br><br>The program introduces a new automation and robotization relief, expands R&D and IP Box reliefs, and offers tax relief for medium-sized enterprises planning an IPO. Support for hiring innovative employees is also proposed through salary deductibility from CIT.<br><br>"RETURN RELIEF"<br><br>Individuals returning to Poland or those who developed businesses abroad will be able to reduce their taxable income by PLN 50,000 in their PIT returns for 2022 and 2023.<br><br>FLAT TAX ON FOREIGN INCOME<br><br>A solution for non-residents relocating their tax residency to Poland, involving a fixed flat tax on foreign income paid in Poland.<br><br>"CAPITAL RETURN"<br><br>An option for citizens with assets or hidden income abroad to repatriate them without facing tax avoidance investigations.<br><br>This proposal outlines significant changes to Poland's tax system, including a universal increase in the tax-free allowance, a higher threshold for the 32% tax bracket, and a shift in how health contributions are calculated for entrepreneurs. The reforms aim to benefit lower earners while potentially increasing the tax burden for higher earners. Corporate tax changes include new reliefs for automation, R&D, and IPO financing, along with provisions for returning expatriates and repatriating foreign assets.<br><br>The proposed changes aim to reduce tax burdens for individuals earning up to approximately PLN 11,000 gross monthly (for employment contracts) and PLN 6,000 gross monthly (for business activities). Those earning above these thresholds will likely see an increase in their total PIT and health contribution payments. The reforms include raising the tax-free amount to PLN 30,000 annually for all taxpayers and adjusting the 32% tax bracket threshold to PLN 120,000. A significant change for entrepreneurs is the shift from lump-sum health contributions to payments proportional to income, alongside the removal of health contribution deductibility from tax. Corporate tax measures include new reliefs for automation, expanded R&D and IP Box reliefs, support for IPOs, and incentives for hiring innovative employees. Additionally, a "return relief" will allow returning workers and those developing businesses abroad to reduce taxable income, and a "capital return" option aims to facilitate the repatriation of foreign assets and income. VAT rules will also see changes, exempting intra-group settlements and potentially taxing financial transactions.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_645" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_645" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_645" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_646" style="display:none;">National Accounting Standards (KSR) are standards and interpretations that provide guidance on accounting matters when the Accounting Act lacks specific answers. Developed by the Accounting Standards Committee, these standards offer solutions for issues like balance sheet valuations and financial statement disclosures. Currently, thirteen published Standards supplement the Accounting Act and bridge Polish regulations with International Accounting Standards.<br><br>A proposed new Standard focuses on financial statement preparation based on whether an entity adopts the going concern assumption. This assumption, fundamental to financial reporting as per the Accounting Act, presumes an entity will continue operating without significant change in the foreseeable future, avoiding bankruptcy or liquidation. It allows the application of other accounting principles without additional directives.<br><br>However, when the going concern assumption is not valid, the new Standard provides crucial guidance. It addresses the assessment of the assumption's validity and outlines accounting principles applicable when an entity ceases operations. The Standard includes guidelines for recognizing situations where the going concern assumption is unjustified, preparing financial statements for entities ceasing operations (including asset and liability valuation), rules for closing and opening accounting books, inventory, and financial statement approval and audit in such scenarios, and disclosure requirements regarding the going concern assumption.<br><br>The project does not introduce revolutionary changes but significantly enhances the detail of guidance on disclosures and balance sheet valuations when the going concern assumption is not met.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_647" style="display:none;">The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) released an updated Report to the Nations on employee fraud in April 2020. The study of 2,504 fraud cases revealed an average loss of $1.6 million per company.<br><br>Employee fraud involves misusing a company position for personal gain and falls into three main categories: asset misappropriation, corruption, and financial statement fraud. Factors like tenure, gender, education, and age influence the amount of damage caused. Men commit the majority of frauds (72%), and better-educated employees with longer tenures tend to cause greater losses.<br><br>The Fraud Triangle theory explains why employees commit fraud, highlighting the importance of addressing risks to prevent it. Weak internal controls, ignored regulations, ineffective oversight, and a tolerant organizational culture contribute to fraud.<br><br>The most common methods for detecting fraud, according to the ACFE report, are tips from whistleblowers (43%), internal audits (15%), management reviews (12%), other sources (6%), and by chance (5%). Implementing a whistleblower program is crucial for effectively detecting and preventing employee fraud. Approximately half of whistleblowers are employees, while the other half are third parties, including clients, vendors, competitors, and anonymous sources. Thoroughly evaluating whistleblower information should be a priority in fraud prevention.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_647" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_647" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_647" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_648" style="display:none;">Employee claims are rights to demand specific actions from an employer, such as wage payments or vacation time. The statute of limitations for these claims is strictly defined by the Labor Code and cannot be altered. This 3-year limitation applies to both financial claims (like unpaid wages or bonuses) and non-financial claims (like unused vacation).<br><br>The limitation period starts when the claim becomes due, generally the day the obligation should have been fulfilled. For wages, this is the day following the payment deadline set in the employment contract or company regulations, with the ultimate deadline being the 10th of the following month. Claims for bonuses or jubilee awards expire three years after the payment date or eligibility date. Overtime pay claims expire three years from the date of payment for the month in which daily overtime occurred, or from the end of the settlement period for average weekly overtime.<br><br>Retirement or disability severance pay claims expire three years after termination if the employee met the eligibility criteria. Vacation claims expire three years after the end of the calendar year the vacation was earned, or the end of the third quarter of the following year for overdue vacation. Severance pay in lieu of unused vacation expires three years from termination. Claims to establish an employment relationship have no statute of limitations, though associated wage claims are subject to the 3-year limit. Claims confirmed by a court ruling or settlement expire after 10 years.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_648" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_648" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_648" style="display:none;"></p>

Despite negative connotations in Poland, the implementation of such systems fosters transparent business practices, builds trust with contractors, and encourages employee engagement. Companies benefit by mitigating risks, enhancing reputation, and preventing potential crises. The directive covers employers with 50 or more employees, with differing implementation deadlines based on company size. By defining irregularities, establishing ethical standards, and ensuring non-retaliation for good-faith reporting, organizations can build a culture of compliance and responsible business growth. A formal approach to whistleblower protection is important, but an opportunity for a new organization culture is even better.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_650" style="display:none;">During the pandemic, remote work became prevalent across many sectors, turning homes into offices for numerous employees. This new arrangement presented both employers and employees with unprecedented challenges and questions. Current remote work guidelines stem from Article 3.1 of the "Crisis Shield," allowing employers to mandate temporary remote work during and up to three months after the COVID-19 state of emergency to combat the virus.<br><br>However, the legislation lacks detailed regulations regarding workplace accidents, health and safety, and reimbursement for home office expenses. Employees often bear additional costs, such as increased energy and internet bills, without clear compensation rules. Employers often attempt to address these issues independently, often including remote work provisions in their work regulations. However, this raises questions about whether such compensation constitutes taxable income for employees.<br><br>Recent interpretations by the Director of the National Fiscal Information have offered clarity on this matter. An interpretation from February 1, 2021, clarified that employers are responsible for providing necessary remote work tools, and employees do not incur taxable income. This applies regardless of whether the employer provides the equipment directly or reimburses the employee for incurred costs. Subsequent interpretations confirmed that reimbursements for equipment, internet, and electricity expenses related to remote work do not constitute employee income.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_650" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_650" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_650" style="display:none;"></p>

Increases include fishing (1.47%), mining support services (3.33%), beverage production (1.47%), tobacco production (1.47%), textile production (1.73%), furniture production (1.73%), and air transport (0.93%).<br><br>Decreases occurred in forestry and logging (2.53%), coal mining (3.06%), oil and gas extraction (2.53%), metal ore mining (2.80%), other mining and quarrying (1.73%), clothing production (0.67%), paper production (1.47%), pharmaceutical production (0.93%), metal production (2.26%), waste management and remediation (1.47%), building construction (1.20%), civil engineering (1.47%), water transport (1.47%), warehousing and transport support (1.20%), and rental and leasing (0.93%). Rates for other activities remain unchanged.<br><br>The Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) determines the accident insurance rate for payers required to submit ZUS IWA information and notifies them by April 20, and the information will also be available on PUE ZUS platform. Others determine their rate based on their Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) code. The accident insurance rate varies based on the type of activity, risk category, number of workplace accidents, and number of employees working in hazardous conditions.<br><br>Businesses can reduce their accident insurance rate by analyzing charges, recovering undue payments, implementing preventive measures, and adhering to occupational health and safety regulations. ZUS also offers grant programs to improve workplace safety and reduce hazards, which can be used for technical upgrades, noise and vibration protection, lighting modernization, safety equipment, and more. All sizes of businesses can apply for these grants.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_651" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_651" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_651" style="display:none;"></p>

The classification of professions and specialties is a systematic collection of professions and specialties in the labor market. A profession is defined as a set of professional activities, separated as a result of the social division of labor. A specialty is defined as a division of labor within a profession, where certain activities require more in-depth knowledge.<br><br>The regulation does not govern the admission to practice a profession or the standardization of education. Instead, it provides a tool for statistics, employment, job placement, research, analysis, and forecasting related to the labor market. The classification has a hierarchical, five-level structure, grouping individual professions and specialties into elementary, medium, large, and major groups based on similarities in the skills required.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_652" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_652" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_652" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_658" style="display:none;">A judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on March 18, 2021, favors Polish taxpayers involved in intra-EU transactions. The court ruled that Article 86, paragraph 10b, point 2 of the Polish VAT Act contradicts the core principles of the EU's common Value Added Tax system.<br><br>Previously, Polish VAT regulations stipulated that VAT due on intra-EU acquisitions had to be declared in the period the tax liability arose. For deductible VAT, taxpayers maintained neutrality in VAT settlement only if they included the deductible VAT in the same month as the VAT due, within three months of the end of the month the tax liability arose. Failure to meet this deadline resulted in the obligation to declare VAT due in the month of its accrual, while deductible VAT had to be accounted for "on current account" in the month of the actual correction. This often led to taxpayers needing to pay VAT due plus interest.<br><br>The CJEU determined that the Polish national regulation exceeded what was necessary for the correct collection of VAT and the prevention of tax fraud. EU law, therefore, prevents the application of these national provisions. The CJEU's model, which involves recognizing VAT due and deductible VAT in the same period for intra-EU transactions, simplifies current settlements for taxpayers and allows Polish businesses to reclaim paid interest where VAT was settled in a staggered manner.<br><br>While this case specifically concerned intra-EU acquisitions (WNT), its implications could extend to other transactions settled under the reverse-charge mechanism, such as the import of services.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_658" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_658" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_658" style="display:none;"></p>

If received after preparation but before approval, material impacts require correcting the statements. Insignificant events or those approved are recorded in the period they are received.<br><br>Events indicating post-balance sheet conditions, such as changes in investment market value, dividend declarations, business combinations, significant asset changes, or major liabilities, require disclosure in the notes to the financial statements if they are material.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_660" style="display:none;">Initial medical examinations are mandatory for individuals hired for a new job and for employees who are transferred to positions with hazardous health factors or difficult working conditions. Employers are legally obligated to ensure that no employee begins work without a current medical certificate confirming their fitness for the specific role and its associated working conditions, as outlined in the referral for the examination.<br><br>A medical certificate is considered current if it reflects the employee's health status on the day they are to commence work in a given position under the specified conditions. Therefore, any change in job role necessitates an initial medical examination *before* the transfer. This obligation arises if the new position involves different hazardous or difficult factors, an increased exposure level to existing factors, or if the work method changes in a way that elevates occupational risks. Examples include operating new equipment, longer work hours, increased stress, radiation exposure, or chemical exposure. When a job change requires such an examination, the referral must detail all hazardous or difficult factors relevant to both the previous and the new role.<br><br>An exception exists where the hazards at the original and new positions are identical, and the only difference is in the scope of tasks. In such cases, repeat examinations are not required. Failure by employers to comply with these medical examination requirements constitutes a misdemeanor against employee rights and workplace safety, potentially resulting in fines ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 PLN, and even civil liability if an employee's health deteriorates due to such negligence. Importantly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the obligation for initial medical examinations, including those related to job changes, remained in effect. In situations where direct access to an authorized physician was limited, other doctors could conduct examinations and issue certificates, potentially via telecommunication systems. Certificates issued under these exceptional circumstances expire 30 days after the epidemic threat status is lifted, unless an epidemic status is declared, or the epidemic is officially ended.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_660" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_660" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_660" style="display:none;"></p>

Failure to maintain employment levels would result in a partial repayment of the subvention, ranging from 0% to 50% depending on the employment reduction.<br><br>For SMEs (10-249 employees) in affected sectors with a minimum 30% revenue drop in Q4 2020 or Nov-Dec 2020 compared to 2019, the subvention was calculated as 70% of the gross loss. This subvention was conditionally repayable. It became non-refundable at 25% unconditionally and up to an additional 25% based on the company's sales loss over 12 months. Maintaining employment at or above 100% of the previous year's level meant an additional 0% repayment was due, while reductions resulted in proportional repayments. In exceptional cases, the Polish Development Fund could adjust waiver conditions for businesses with significant revenue drops.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_661" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_661" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_661" style="display:none;"></p>

This regulation clarifies a crucial point: taxpayers whose place of business or permanent establishment is located in the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) or Norway are no longer required to appoint a tax representative as stipulated in Article 18a of the Value Added Tax Act of March 11, 2004.<br><br>This exemption is due to the existence of administrative cooperation agreements, anti-fraud pacts, and debt recovery arrangements, or similar agreements, concluded with these countries regarding VAT. These provisions allow companies from the UK and Norway to conduct business in Poland under their existing operational frameworks. The regulation became effective on February 26, 2021, but its provisions are retroactive, applying from January 1, 2021. Consequently, entities from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and Norway do not need to act through a tax representative when filing their January 2021 VAT returns. The legal basis for this is the Regulation of the Minister of Finance, Funds, and Regional Policy of February 23, 2021.<br><br>Key takeaways are related to Brexit and tax representation for VAT in Poland.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_663" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_663" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_663" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_664" style="display:none;">Incoterms are a set of rules created by the International Chamber of Commerce to regulate the terms of sale between buyers and sellers in international trade. They are updated every 10 years, with Incoterms 2020 being the current version. There are 11 rules divided into four groups (C, D, E, F), each defining responsibilities for transport organization, cost sharing, risk transfer, and customs clearance.<br><br>Group C rules require the seller to organize and pay for transport, with risk transferring upon shipment. Group D rules obligate the seller to deliver goods to a specified destination. Group E, comprising only EXW, places the minimal responsibility on the seller to make goods available at their premises. Group F rules mean the seller handles export clearance but not transport or insurance costs.<br><br>In accounting, Incoterms are crucial for determining the timing of delivery and, consequently, the point at which a VAT liability arises. For rules like CPT/CIP and FCA, delivery, and thus VAT obligation, occurs when goods are loaded onto the transport. Under DAP, delivery is when goods reach the agreed destination. For EXW, delivery happens when the seller makes goods available to the buyer at the seller's location. Understanding Incoterms is essential for accurate VAT calculations, invoice issuance, and overall financial reporting.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_664" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_664" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_664" style="display:none;"></p>

This list is not exhaustive. Failure to comply can result in a fine of up to PLN 250,000. Businesses must also notify the relevant tax office of the website address where this information is published.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_666" style="display:none;">The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted accounting practices, particularly for the 2020 financial statements. The Accounting Standards Committee (KSR) has issued recommendations to address the complexities of accounting for financial support received due to COVID-19, often referred to as the "Anti-Crisis Shield." These recommendations categorize support based on its economic substance, providing guidance on recognition, presentation, and disclosure.<br><br>Key forms of support include non-repayable cash subsidies, which are recognized as other operating income upon receipt. Forgiveness or reduction of public liabilities increases other operating income. Loan repayment deferrals or extended credit lines necessitate a re-evaluation of liabilities at their settlement amount or amortized cost. Preferential loans are recorded as liabilities and, if forgiven, the forgiven portion becomes other operating income. Financial subsidies from the PFR are recognized as liabilities, with forgiven portions treated as other operating income.<br><br>In presentation, most of this support, including forgiven amounts, is reported as other operating income and linked to the relevant balance sheet item. Specific presentation requirements vary based on the financial statement annex used. Disclosures are crucial if the support significantly impacts the entity's assessment, detailing the nature and amounts of aid received within the "Additional information and explanations" section. This ensures transparency regarding the financial impact of pandemic-related support measures.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_666" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_666" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_666" style="display:none;"></p>

To verify an employee's status, employers can review employment certificates for bailiff seizure notices. The National Register of Debtors was intended as another resource, but its implementation was delayed until July 1, 2021. Consequently, before this date, employers risked penalties if they were unaware of an employee's alimony debts and the employee did not disclose them, or if no bailiff seizure notice was received.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_668" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_668" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_668" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_670" style="display:none;">The year 2021 brought significant tax law changes, introducing new financial burdens and extensive formal obligations for taxpayers. To comply, businesses must develop procedures to avoid penalties, thereby increasing the risks associated with economic activity.<br><br>Key changes impacting entrepreneurs include the requirement to disclose tax strategy. Companies, including capital groups and those exceeding 50 million euros in revenue, must prepare and publish their tax strategies by the end of the twelfth month following the tax year. This includes providing specific information, with the exception of trade secrets. Failure to comply can result in fines of up to 250,000 PLN.<br><br>Another significant change is the restriction on utilizing prior year losses after restructuring if the business's core activity changes or if a new entity acquires a significant stake. This aims to prevent the misuse of tax benefits but may hinder economically motivated restructurings.<br><br>Transfer pricing documentation now has lower thresholds for transactions with entities in countries with harmful tax competition, requiring documentation for both revenue and cost transactions exceeding 100,000 PLN. Entities must also investigate the beneficial owner's status for compliance.<br><br>New regulations define "real estate companies," imposing obligations such as withholding tax on the sale of shares if the seller is non-resident and holds at least 5% of the voting rights. Real estate companies may also need to report their shareholders to tax authorities. These changes necessitate careful financial and tax analysis by businesses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_670" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_670" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_670" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_673" style="display:none;">**What is the definition of an error?**<br><br>National Accounting Standard No. 7 defines errors made in previous financial years as omissions or irregularities in financial statements that cause significant distortions, rendering them unreliable. These errors stem from failure to consider or incorrect consideration of information available at the time of preparation, or information that could reasonably be expected to be obtained. Sources include arithmetic mistakes, oversights, misinterpretations, or fraud. Only material errors, which can influence economic decisions of users individually or collectively, are of concern. Materiality considers the magnitude, nature of omission, and surrounding circumstances.<br><br>**What is not a correction of an error?**<br><br>Accounting standards dictate that all detected errors are subject to correction. However, changes in estimates (e.g., provisions, depreciation rates, asset impairment), effects of changes in accounting policies due to new regulations or entity initiative, and consequences of events unknown despite due diligence are not considered errors.<br><br>**Correcting errors – recording and disclosure in statements**<br><br>Errors in the current financial year detected before the annual financial statement are corrected within that year. If detected after preparation but before approval, materiality determines the correction. Immaterial errors are adjusted in the next financial year. Material errors require correction in the year the statement was prepared, necessitating a revised financial statement.<br><br>Correcting prior-year errors in approved financial statements is more complex. Immaterial errors adjust net profit/loss or equity for the current or unapproved prior year. Material errors involve:<br><br>*   Recognition in equity as prior-period adjustments.<br>*   Inclusion in the statement of changes in equity.<br>*   Retrospective restatement of data, if feasible.<br><br>Additionally, material prior-year errors require disclosure of the error type, its impact on revenue and costs, and the correction amount for the current and prior periods.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_673" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_673" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_673" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_674" style="display:none;">Every entrepreneur, whether operating individually or as a commercial company, must constantly attend to numerous aspects of their daily operations. In times of haste, uncertainty, and stress, mistakes and omissions are more likely, increasing the risk of damages and claims. Entrepreneurs wishing to transfer some business-related risks to an insurer and insure their property must first thoroughly assess potential risks, check their security measures, and estimate potential damages.<br><br>An insurance audit objectively evaluates the quality of insurance protection resulting from existing insurance contracts. Typically conducted by an insurance broker, it involves a detailed identification of risks associated with the entrepreneur's business and property, both external and internal. The broker analyzes client documents, procedures, certificates, previous claims data, and, if necessary, engages experts. The audit identifies business and environmental risks, inspects facilities, analyzes insurance needs, and reviews existing contracts for legal and economic effectiveness, providing conclusions and recommendations. For large assets, a risk assessment engineer verifies facility condition, machinery, security systems, fire and theft protection, and storage practices. Thermal imaging audits may be used to identify fire risks. The broker then meticulously reviews existing policies, checking coverage scope, insured sums, deductibles, compensation methods, and exclusions. The client receives a personalized report with conclusions on their current insurance protection level relative to identified risks and recommendations for improvement and enhanced coverage in new contracts.<br><br>An insurance audit is generally the first step in broker-client collaboration. Minor suggestions, such as switching from named perils to all-risk coverage or expanding liability insurance, can significantly improve a business's security. Realized hypothetical loss scenarios have demonstrated the value of adhering to broker recommendations, leading to clients being protected by updated insurance policies and fostering long-term relationships.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_674" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_674" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_674" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_675" style="display:none;">The project outlines key information regarding Estonian CIT regulations, specifically focusing on the lump-sum tax rate. The tax rate is determined by several factors: the taxpayer's revenue level (small taxpayer status or average revenue not exceeding the small taxpayer threshold), the basis of taxation (net profit or other income), and the level of investment expenditures.<br><br>For small taxpayers and those with average revenues below the small taxpayer limit, the tax rate is 15% of the tax base. All other taxpayers face a 25% rate. Furthermore, the project details a reduced tax rate for companies that opt out of the Estonian CIT system. If a company leaves the system and is taxed on net profit, the rate can be reduced by five percentage points for that specific profit, provided that investment expenditures meet certain thresholds. These thresholds are 50% over a two-year period or 110% over a four-year period, as defined by specific articles of the CIT Act. This reduced rate does not apply to income other than net profit. The regulations also stipulate that to maintain eligibility for the reduced rate after multiple four-year periods, taxpayers must continue to meet the increased investment expenditure requirements. Examples are provided within the project to aid understanding, and the final version of the explanations is awaited.<br><br>The project provides comprehensive details on the Estonian CIT, specifically addressing the applicable lump-sum tax rates. It clarifies that the tax rate is contingent upon the taxpayer's revenue size, qualifying them as a small taxpayer or having average revenues below a defined threshold. The nature of the taxable income (net profit versus other income) and the extent of investment expenditures also influence the rate.<br><br>Specifically, small taxpayers and those within the average revenue threshold are subject to a 15% tax on their base. Other taxpayers are subject to a 25% rate. The project also introduces a potential reduction in the tax rate for companies that transition away from the Estonian CIT regime. If such companies are taxed on net profit, the rate can be lowered by five percentage points if they fulfill specific investment expenditure requirements over either two-year or four-year periods. This reduced rate is exclusively for net profit income. The regulations require sustained investment efforts to retain the benefit of the reduced rate over extended periods. The project includes illustrative examples to facilitate correct application of these rules.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_675" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_675" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_675" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_677" style="display:none;">This document explains the concept and process of a "saldo confirmation" (potwierdzenie salda) in business accounting. It is a mutual confirmation between businesses that their records of completeness, payments, and outstanding balances align. For example, if Company A records a debt owed by Company B of 1,000 PLN, Company A sends a saldo confirmation to Company B. Company B then checks its books and, if the amount and reason match, signs and returns the confirmation. If there's a discrepancy, Company B indicates its recorded amount and reasons, prompting further reconciliation before financial statements are finalized.<br><br>Accounting departments typically prepare these confirmations, but unit managers are ultimately responsible for ensuring they are sent annually, as mandated by the Accounting Act. The law requires confirmations for all receivables, allowing both paper and electronic formats, with proof of dispatch and receipt being crucial. These confirmations must be sent no earlier than two months before the financial year-end and require explicit confirmation, not implied acceptance. Exceptions include disputed debts, public law receivables, and receivables from individuals or businesses not keeping accounting records.<br><br>Regular saldo confirmations offer benefits beyond legal compliance. They help identify and resolve discrepancies, potentially leading to timely invoice payments and a reduction in outstanding receivables. They also aid in identifying and correcting errors or missing documents, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of financial records before year-end reporting. The legal basis for this process is found in specific articles of the Accounting Act.<br><br>This document outlines the purpose and legal requirements of saldo confirmations for businesses. It serves as a mutual verification tool between companies to ensure their accounting records for receivables and payables are accurate and complete. The process involves sending confirmations of outstanding balances, typically for receivables, to counterparties. The counterparties are expected to review these confirmations and respond, either confirming the balance or highlighting any discrepancies. This reconciliation is crucial for maintaining accurate financial statements.<br><br>The Accounting Act mandates this practice, specifying that confirmations should be sent within a certain timeframe before the year-end and requiring explicit confirmation rather than assumed agreement. Certain types of receivables are exempt from this process. The benefits of regular saldo confirmations extend beyond legal compliance, aiding in the identification of payment issues, facilitating the correction of accounting errors, and ultimately improving the reliability of financial reporting.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_677" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_677" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_677" style="display:none;"></p>

These changes, effective from January 1, 2021, significantly alter the rules for correcting VAT invoices.<br><br>Previously, "in-minus" correction invoices (reducing taxable base) were generally recognized in the period the seller received confirmation of the buyer's receipt. If confirmation was received before the VAT declaration deadline, the reduction could be applied in the period the correction was initially recorded. However, the confirmation method was left to the buyer's discretion. The new rules allow sellers to reduce the taxable base in the period the correction is issued, provided they have documentation proving the reduction was agreed upon with the buyer. Without such documentation, the correction is recorded when it's obtained.<br><br>"In-plus" correction invoices (increasing taxable base), previously based on interpretations and case law, will now be directly regulated. If the correction rectifies an error made on the original invoice that led to an underestimation of tax, it will be settled in the same period as the original invoice. For corrections due to circumstances arising after the initial sale, the invoice will be recorded on its issuance date.<br><br>Another key simplification allows taxpayers to choose the same exchange rate for VAT settlements as used for income tax revenue reporting, simplifying currency conversions. This choice, however, requires consistent application for at least 12 months. Standard VAT conversion rules apply to transactions not aligned with income tax revenue recognition principles.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_678" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_678" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_678" style="display:none;"></p>

Previously, individuals under 26 years old were exempt from personal income tax on earnings from employment relationships, commissioned labor contracts (umowy zlecenia), and similar forms of work. This exemption now covers income earned from graduate apprenticeships and student traineeships.<br><br>The tax exemption applies to income earned by individuals up to the age of 26, up to an annual limit of 85,528 PLN (the first tax bracket). Since 2020, individuals do not need to submit a declaration to utilize this relief, unless their annual income is expected to exceed the exemption limit. The scope of income covered by this relief is clearly defined, encompassing various forms of remuneration for employment and specific types of commissioned labor contracts. However, income from other sources, such as contracts for specific works (umowy o dzieło), certain types of foreign income, royalty income, social security benefits, and unemployment benefits, are not covered by this exemption. Proper calculation of income costs is essential for those benefiting from the relief, especially if their income exceeds the annual threshold.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_679" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_679" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_679" style="display:none;"></p>

It covers most employees working under various contract types, provided their earnings are subject to retirement and disability contributions. Participation is generally automatic for employees aged 18-55, who can opt out. Individuals over 55 but under 70 can join voluntarily, while those over 70 are excluded. Employers must choose a financial institution from an approved list, considering factors like experience and credibility. Contributions are shared, with employees contributing 2% (optional additional 2%) and employers contributing 1.5% (optional additional 2.5%) of gross salary. The state provides a one-time "welcome" payment and annual contributions. Managing PPK involves ongoing tasks like contribution calculation and record-keeping, which can be outsourced to accounting firms to ensure compliance and efficiency.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_681" style="display:none;">Effective internal control is crucial for a company's competitiveness, enabling it to manage business and fraud risks efficiently. Every business decision carries inherent risk, and effective internal control minimizes the likelihood of unachieved objectives. Risk management, encompassing identification, assessment, and counteraction, is integral to business management through internal controls. The stronger the internal control, the lower the risk and the higher the chance of goal achievement, leading to a more efficient, profitable, and secure company.<br><br>While some companies have dedicated risk management or internal audit functions, many in Poland find establishing these internally costly. Consequently, external services are a viable solution. Firms like Grupa Rewit offer support in building and improving internal control systems, conducting oversight and operational controls, managing risks, performing internal audits, verifying compliance, ensuring security, and identifying/counteracting fraud. These tailored services involve independent assessment of a company's management and controls, evaluating risk awareness and appetite. The process includes reviewing regulations, control scope, employee interviews, and IT system control assessments. The diagnostic results provide a roadmap for improving controls in high-risk areas, either independently or with expert assistance.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_681" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_681" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_681" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_682" style="display:none;">The basis for calculating sickness and maternity benefits is generally the average monthly salary over the preceding 12 months, after deducting employee-paid social security contributions. However, this basis cannot be lower than the minimum wage minus 13.71% of that wage. For part-time workers, these amounts are proportionally reduced.<br><br>Maternity benefit amounts vary: 100% of the calculation basis for the initial maternity leave, adoption leave, and paternity leave periods, as well as up to 6.8 or 3 weeks of parental leave. The remaining parental leave is compensated at 60%.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_683" style="display:none;">While we have become accustomed to the changes in VAT reporting that came into effect on October 1, 2020, it's important to remember that not only the JPK file structure changed, but also the procedure for submitting corrections. Previously, submitting a corrected JPK_VAT file to the Ministry of Finance did not require an active repentance – as, according to tax authorities and the National Tax Information, this file was solely tax information.<br><br>The new regulations mean the JPK_V7 file consists of two parts: the declarative and the evidentiary. This implies that any corrections to the file can relate to:<br><br>*   Exclusively the declarative part.<br>*   Exclusively the evidentiary part.<br>*   Both the declarative and evidentiary parts simultaneously.<br><br>While Article 16a of the Fiscal Penal Code (KKS) remains unchanged – stating that a taxpayer is not subject to sanctions if they submit a corrected tax declaration (i.e., the declarative part) and settle any tax underpayment with interest – a new provision, Article 61a, has been added. This article addresses the violation of the obligation to submit books to the proper tax authority.<br><br>The new regulation is significant because the evidentiary part of the JPK-V7 file is treated as a "book" as referred to in Article 53(21) of the KKS. This means that any correction to the evidentiary part of the JPK_V7 file will necessitate submitting an active repentance to the tax office. According to the Ministry of Finance, this constitutes a cumulative concurrence of provisions (Art. 7 KKS), where the same act fulfills the conditions of two provisions: Art. 56 (providing incorrect data in a declaration) and Art. 61a (submitting unreliable books or records). Failure to apply the active repentance institution when correcting the evidentiary part, or both the evidentiary and declarative parts together, can expose taxpayers to severe financial penalties.<br><br>To protect against sanctions, taxpayers can use the "active repentance" institution under Article 16 KKS. This involves notifying the tax authority of a committed offense and describing all relevant circumstances. Active repentance can be submitted orally, in writing, or electronically via the e-PUAP platform, which was recently introduced as a convenience. Key elements of an active repentance include taxpayer identification, recipient, circumstances of the offense, co-perpetrators, and confirmation of remediation. It's crucial that active repentance is submitted before the tax authority is aware of the offense.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_683" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_683" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_683" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_684" style="display:none;">Proposed changes to Polish law aim to promote electromobility by altering vehicle depreciation rules. Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles will retain a higher depreciation limit of PLN 225,000 for tax purposes. However, owners of other passenger cars, including hybrids, will face a reduced depreciation limit of PLN 100,000, down from the current PLN 150,000. This change, set to take effect from January 1, 2026, applies to both corporate (CIT) and personal (PIT) income tax payers. The legislation seeks to incentivize the adoption of low-emission vehicles.<br><br>A significant concern is the lack of transitional provisions for vehicles put into use before the new rules come into effect. This absence creates uncertainty regarding how to handle depreciation for cars exceeding the new PLN 100,000 limit but falling below the previous PLN 150,000 threshold, especially if their amortization period extends beyond January 1, 2026. This ambiguity may necessitate proportional application of the new limits, potentially impacting how these costs are recognized for tax purposes. The proposed changes are currently under review.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_684" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_684" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_684" style="display:none;"></p>

HR tasks intertwine with payroll and OHS (Occupational Health and Safety) responsibilities, with HR involvement starting before formal employment.<br><br>Before starting work, employees must have a medical certificate confirming fitness for duty. Employers can issue referrals for initial medical examinations or accept a previous, valid certificate if working conditions and hazards remain the same.

Employers must also track the expiry dates of medical certificates and any changes in workplace hazards.<br><br>OHS compliance is also essential. Employees must be briefed on safety and hygiene procedures through initial training, documented by an "Initial Training Card in Occupational Health and Safety." This includes general and job-specific instruction. Employers should conduct job-specific training upon any role change, monitor periodic OHS training dates, and maintain occupational risk assessments and job descriptions, updating them for evolving conditions. Documentation for the lifespan of personal protective equipment (PPE) and laundry allowances is also necessary if work clothing and safety gear are required.<br><br>All these documents must be properly recorded and stored, becoming part of the employee's personal file. These files are dynamic, reflecting the ongoing employment relationship, duties, and employee life changes. Employee working time must be meticulously recorded, including start and end times. Leave-related documentation, such as requests, cancellations, and confirmations, also needs to be maintained. Employers must monitor ZUS PUE for medical certificates and quarantine information. Records of paid wages and benefits, as well as employee requests for direct payment, are mandatory. Additionally, records of work clothing and PPE allocation, along with documentation for allowances for using and maintaining personal items, are required. Employees must be provided with equal treatment regulations, like extracts from the Labor Code, and informed about data processing policies (RODO). Companies with over 50 employees must have work regulations and remuneration regulations, potentially including bonus schemes, and increasingly, remote work regulations.<br><br>Summary:<br>Navigating employment law and HR responsibilities is crucial for all businesses, starting from the first hire. These obligations encompass crucial areas like occupational medicine and safety (OHS), alongside meticulous record-keeping. Employers must ensure employees undergo necessary pre-employment medical examinations, ensuring these are conducted by contracted medical professionals and that certificates are current. OHS compliance involves comprehensive training, risk assessments, and managing safety equipment, all documented meticulously. Furthermore, maintaining accurate employee records is paramount. This includes personal files, working time records, leave applications, and payroll information. For larger companies, specific regulations regarding work and remuneration, and now remote work, must be established. Professional HR support can significantly ease the burden of these complex, evolving legal requirements, ensuring compliance and a supportive environment for employees.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_686" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_686" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_686" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_687" style="display:none;">What will change regarding contracts for specific works in 2021?<br><br>Previously, contracts for specific works (umowa o dzieło) concluded with individuals not employed by the company under an employment contract were not reported to ZUS, and social and health insurance contributions were not paid. However, starting January 1, 2021, changes introduced by the Act of March 31, 2020, amending the "COVID-19 Act," come into effect. Under these new regulations, payers of contributions or individuals will be obligated to submit information to the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) for every concluded contract for specific works. Exceptions to this rule apply if the contract is made with someone not in an employment relationship with the payer, or if the work under the contract is not performed for the employer with whom the individual has an employment relationship. Such reports must be submitted within 7 days of the contract's conclusion and will be recorded in the payer's account.<br><br>How to inform ZUS about a contract for specific works?<br><br>A new regulation is expected, which will likely introduce a new insurance document, ZUS RUD, for reporting these contracts to ZUS.<br><br>What is the purpose of these changes?<br><br>Officially, the changes are intended for analytical and statistical purposes, to streamline benefit payments under anti-crisis shields, and to enable ZUS to verify social insurance obligations for individuals performing work under such contracts. Unofficially, there is speculation about taxing all civil law contracts, including contracts for specific works, which could increase costs for many entrepreneurs.<br><br>How to prepare for the upcoming obligations?<br><br>It is advisable to anticipate ZUS inspections for payers who enter into contracts for specific works. Furthermore, it is crucial to verify the appropriateness of using contracts for specific works, ensuring their content and the tasks assigned align with the nature of such contracts. Businesses should be aware of the potential risk of reclassifying these as employment or service contracts, which could result in back payments of contributions and interest.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_687" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_687" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_687" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_689" style="display:none;">According to Article 5j of the Act of March 4, 1994, on the Company Social Benefits Fund (ZFŚS), budgetary units and local government budgetary establishments are obligated to create the fund regardless of the number of employees as of January 1, 2021. For other employers, the obligation depends on the number of employees. Employers with at least 50 full-time employees as of January 1, 2021, or those with 20-49 employees if a trade union requests it, must create the fund. Employers with fewer than 50 employees can decide not to create the fund or pay holiday benefits.<br><br>The Act specifies contributions for employees working in normal and special conditions, as well as for young employees, based on the average monthly wage in the national economy in the second half of 2018, which was PLN 4,134.02. Contribution rates vary: approximately PLN 1,550.26 for normal conditions, PLN 2,067.01 for special conditions, and different amounts for young employees depending on the year of apprenticeship. Additional contributions exist for disabled employees, retirees under the employer's social care, and employers operating nurseries or children's clubs.<br><br>The granting of subsidized services and benefits depends on the individual's living, family, and financial situation. The employer determines the rules and conditions for using the fund's resources in a regulation. Employers obligated to create the fund can reduce the contribution with the agreement of trade unions or employee representatives. Decisions regarding the ZFŚS must be made by the end of January.<br><br>Companies employing fewer than 50 people can introduce holiday benefits, not exceeding PLN 1,550.26 in 2021, paid once a year to employees taking at least 14 consecutive days of vacation. These benefits differ from "vacation under the pear tree" benefits paid by companies with a ZFŚS and are not means-tested. Holiday benefits are exempt from social security contributions, unlike voluntary vacation bonuses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_689" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_689" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_689" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_692" style="display:none;">In recent years, limited partnerships have been a popular business structure in Poland. According to the Central Statistical Office, the number of limited partnerships increased by 13.3% in 2019 compared to 2018, while all commercial law companies increased by 6.4% in the same period. This popularity stemmed from the limited liability of the limited partner (komandytariusz) and the tax transparency, where only the partners paid income tax.<br><br>However, amendments to the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act, effective January 1, 2021, have changed the tax rules, making limited partnerships CIT payers. General partnerships with non-natural person partners will also be subject to CIT unless they disclose information about their CIT and PIT-paying partners.<br><br>Under the new rules, the general partner (komplementariusz) can deduct a portion of the CIT paid by the partnership from their income tax, offsetting the impact. However, limited partners will effectively face double taxation, both at the partnership level and individually. A tax exemption is provided for the limited partner, amounting to 50% of income from profit sharing, capped at PLN 60,000 annually per partnership, but restrictions apply based on ownership links and management roles. The new rules may apply from May 1, 2021, if the company chooses, while the financial books need to be closed the day before that happens.<br><br>These changes are expected to significantly reduce the popularity of limited partnerships, with businesses potentially shifting to general partnerships or limited liability companies.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_694" style="display:none;">On October 28, 2020, the Council of Ministers approved a bill amending the laws on personal income tax, corporate income tax, and lump-sum income tax on certain income earned by individuals, among other laws. The law introduces changes to the regulations concerning the registered lump-sum tax. Key updates include increased income limits, revised tax rates, and the extension of lump-sum taxation to rental income from business activities, all effective from 2021.<br><br>The Ministry anticipates these changes will benefit taxpayers by enhancing the attractiveness of the lump-sum taxation method and broadening the range of taxpayers eligible to use it. Lump-sum taxation involves paying tax at a fixed percentage rate on total income, without deductions for business expenses, although income can be reduced by paid social security contributions.<br><br>Specifically, the changes increase the income threshold for electing the lump-sum tax and for making quarterly payments. The eligibility limit for using this form of taxation will rise from 250,000 to 2 million euros. The law also modifies several lump-sum tax rates, introducing new rates depending on the income source, such as 17%, 15%, 12.5%, 10%, 8.5%, 3%, and 2%. Furthermore, it eliminates many cases where specific activities disqualify taxpayers from using the lump-sum. Entrepreneurs engaged in activities currently excluded from this form of taxation will now be eligible. The definition of "free professions" eligible for lump-sum taxation will be updated to include legal, accounting, tax advisory, and rental services. The regulations also unify the lump-sum rate for rental and accommodation services and taxpayers renting properties as part of their business activity will be able to tax them with a flat-rate income tax. Most of these provisions are set to take effect on January 1, 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_694" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_694" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_694" style="display:none;"></p>

This includes reserves for deferred income tax, retirement and similar benefits, and other reserves. Retirement and other reserves, along with other reserves are further divided into long-term and short-term portions. Deferred income tax reserves are always classified as long-term, regardless of their utilization timeframe.<br><br>Long-term reserves are those expected to be used beyond 12 months from the balance sheet date, while short-term reserves are anticipated to be used within that 12-month period. Deferred income tax reserves are created due to temporary differences that will increase the future income tax base.<br><br>Reserves for retirement benefits encompass all significant employee benefits arising from legal regulations, collective agreements, or employment contracts, excluding restructuring reserves. Companies also create reserves for unused vacation time or management bonuses tied to profits. Restructuring reserves cover costs associated with significant changes in operations, such as personnel reductions or facility closures, only recognized when there is a commitment to restructure and costs can be reliably estimated.<br><br>Other reserves include accruals for probable and material operating costs with uncertain timing, like warranty repairs or environmental remediation. Reserves for losses cover unfavorable events, such as guarantees or pending lawsuits. Specific accounting treatment for VAT, social security, and other public liabilities may vary based on differing theories, which must be disclosed in accounting policies. The additional information must provide specifics like purpose, opening balance, increases, usage, reversals and closing balance of reserves. It also includes obligation descriptions, uncertainty disclosures, key assumptions and anticipated asset returns.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_695" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_695" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_695" style="display:none;"></p>

These 50% deductible expenses apply exclusively to creators in fields like architecture, literature, music, computer programming, journalism, scientific and artistic endeavors.<br><br>Copyright law protects any original, individual expression of creative activity, regardless of its form, value, or purpose. Royalties under employment or civil law contracts can also qualify for the 50% deductible expenses.<br><br>To establish a royalty for work performed under an employment contract, the contract must differentiate between the royalty component and the employee duties component. Detailing the time spent on creative work as a percentage is insufficient. The royalty must be linked to the creation of a specific work or works. Documentation of copyright income and its amount is required and can be proven by any legally admissible evidence. Examples of evidence include records of created works, declarations documenting the creation of a specific work, or time records linked to a specific work. The annual deductible expense limit for copyright royalties in 2020 was PLN 85,528.00.

Many employers utilized crisis shield provisions to reduce working hours, which, coupled with wage subsidies, helped preserve jobs. However, the initial rules were disadvantageous for individuals receiving sickness and maternity benefits. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights highlighted this issue and advocated for changes.<br><br>Previously, the basis for calculating sickness benefit was the average monthly salary over the preceding 12 months. If an employee's working hours were reduced within the calculation period or the month of incapacity, their benefit was based on the lower salary. This led to reduced benefits for many, estimated to affect around a thousand people, including those on maternity leave.<br><br>The updated legislation revises the calculation basis for sickness and maternity benefits. It will no longer consider reductions in working hours or less favorable COVID-19-related remuneration schemes. Individuals whose working hours are reduced under new arrangements will have their benefits calculated based on their full former working hours, preventing a loss of income. These changes are retroactive.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_702" style="display:none;">When preparing financial statements, entities must identify business risks and assess their probable costs. This identification process leads to the creation of provisions for liabilities. Provisions are defined as liabilities with uncertain timing or amount, as per accounting regulations and international standards. They represent existing, unavoidable obligations to provide future benefits, with estimable amounts. The key characteristic of provisions is the uncertainty regarding their final value, settlement date, and sometimes even the recipient of the benefits when they are recognized. Consequently, provisions require separate accounting and disclosure in financial statements, presented as "Provisions for liabilities" in the liabilities section of the balance sheet.<br><br>While uncertainty exists, it does not justify excessive provisions or deliberate overstatement of liabilities. Conversely, difficulties in estimating a provision's amount or settlement date should not lead to its omission. If reliable estimation is impossible, the liability may be disclosed off-balance sheet or as a contingent liability. However, if it doesn't materially distort the entity's financial position, foregoing provision creation is permissible. Provisions are classified as other operating costs or financial costs depending on the associated circumstances.<br><br>Provisions are maintained until the risk they cover ceases. When the risk materializes, the provision is converted into a liability. Provisions are reduced (utilized) when the obligation they were created for arises. If the risk diminishes or disappears, unused provisions increase other operating income or financial income. Insufficient provisions to cover a liability are written off to current period costs. Compensation between different provisions is not permitted. Tax-wise, provisions are generally not recognized as revenue-generating costs, only actual expenses incurred are deductible. The purpose of provisions is to safeguard against probable economic risks, reflect risks for a true financial picture, and ensure matching of revenues and costs.<br><br>The ultimate goal of provisions is to protect an entity from probable economic risks and potential losses associated with its operations. They serve to reflect these risks in the books, providing a clear and reliable picture of the entity's financial health. By creating provisions, companies can better match revenues and expenses, ensuring a more accurate representation of their financial performance. This practice is crucial for maintaining financial transparency and enabling informed decision-making by stakeholders. The proper accounting and disclosure of provisions are essential for presenting a faithful view of an entity's financial position and its ability to meet future obligations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_702" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_702" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_702" style="display:none;"></p>

Specifically, the 50% deduction from the tax base for qualifying costs related to robotization investments will cover the purchase or leasing of new robots and cobots, software, peripherals (such as track systems, manipulators, controllers, sensors, and end effectors), workplace safety and health (BHP) equipment, and training for employees who will operate the new equipment. Deputy Minister of Finance Jan Sarnowski confirmed the upcoming CIT and PIT relief for robotization.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_703" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_703" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_703" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_704" style="display:none;">On September 16, a draft amendment to Polish tax laws concerning personal income tax, corporate income tax, and lump-sum income tax for individuals was published. This amendment introduces a definition for a "real estate company." A real estate company is defined as an entity, including non-corporate ones, where at least 50% of its market value assets over any 12 consecutive months consist of real estate located in Poland or rights to such real estate.<br><br>The justification for this definition cites the need for special regulations to align domestic law with double taxation treaties, particularly due to difficulties in collecting tax liabilities from shareholders of real estate companies.<br><br>A key change is that if shares in a defined real estate company are sold, and at least one party to the transaction is not a Polish tax resident, the real estate company itself will be obligated to act as a tax agent and pay income tax on the sale. Currently, the seller is responsible for this tax settlement, but non-residents often fail to declare such income in Poland.<br><br>Furthermore, the draft mandates that real estate companies must appoint a tax representative. Failure to do so will result in a monetary penalty of up to PLN 1,000,000 imposed by the tax office. The tax representative will be jointly liable with the real estate company for the tax obligations they handle.<br><br>Additionally, real estate companies will be required to provide information to the Head of the National Fiscal Administration regarding entities holding direct or indirect shares, partnerships, or similar rights within them for each tax or financial year.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_704" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_704" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_704" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_705" style="display:none;">When hiring an employee, remember the following:<br><br>**Employment Contract:** A proper employment contract is crucial, whether it's for a trial period, a fixed term, or an indefinite period. It must be in writing, and any oral agreements need to be documented and signed by both parties. Any changes to the contract's terms also require written confirmation. The contract should clearly define the type of work (position, profession), place of work (specific address or designated area), working hours (full-time or part-time, specifying potential overtime entitlements), remuneration (including components like functional, seniority, special condition, special skill, and regulatory bonuses), and the start date.<br><br>**Medical Examinations:** New employees must undergo initial medical examinations before or on their first day of work. Throughout employment, periodic or control medical check-ups are necessary. These examinations are conducted at the employer's expense by a occupational medicine clinic with which the employer has a contractual agreement.<br><br>**Basic Information:** Within seven days of signing the contract, employees must receive essential information, including daily and weekly working hours, salary payment frequency, holiday entitlement, notice periods, and details about any applicable collective bargaining agreements. If the employer lacks internal work regulations, additional information about night hours, salary payment specifics, and procedures for attendance and absence justification must be provided.<br><br>**Health and Safety Training:** Initial health and safety (BHP) training must be completed before an employee begins work. This includes general instruction on labor code BHP regulations and job-specific training covering safe work methods and hazard mitigation. This training must be documented with the employee's confirmation.<br><br>**Social Security Registration:** Within seven days of hiring, employees must be registered with the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) for social and health insurance.<br><br>When hiring an employee, ensuring a legally compliant employment contract, including clear terms on work, hours, and pay, is paramount. The contract must be in writing, and any amendments require the same formality. Employees are entitled to medical examinations, both initially and periodically, with the employer covering the costs. Essential information regarding working conditions, holidays, notice periods, and collective agreements must be provided within seven days. Furthermore, mandatory health and safety training, covering general principles and job-specific hazards, is required before work commences and must be documented. Finally, timely registration with the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) for both social and health insurance is a legal obligation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_705" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_705" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_705" style="display:none;"></p>

This law mandates supervisory boards of listed companies to prepare an annual report on the remuneration of the management board and supervisory board, encompassing all benefits regardless of their form. This report must also be assessed by an independent auditor.<br><br>The remuneration report will be prepared separately from the annual financial statements. It needs to detail the total remuneration, explain its alignment with the company's remuneration policy and its contribution to long-term performance, and outline how performance criteria were applied. The report should also include information on changes in remuneration, company performance, and average employee wages (non-management/supervisory board members) over the last five fiscal years.

Taxpayers will directly provide the Head of the National Revenue Administration with detailed information about transactions with related parties. Taxpayers can refer to the explanations on how to prepare the transfer pricing information and the Ministry of Finance's draft document "TPR: Questions and Answers" for guidance.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_715" style="display:none;">A draft law amending income tax acts for individuals and corporations, as well as the flat-rate income tax act, has been published. The government aims to tighten the corporate and individual income tax systems, linking tax amounts paid by large, especially multinational, companies to their actual income location. The draft addresses loopholes in CIT, sparking concern among taxpayers.<br><br>The proposed solutions include extending CIT to limited partnerships and undisclosed general partnerships in Poland, facilitating tax recovery on real estate company share sales by non-residents. It also mandates public tax policy disclosure for select corporate income taxpayers and modifies transfer pricing rules. Adjustments are made for the Polish economy, particularly concerning debt financing and tax policy. Furthermore, the draft aims to align depreciation cost recognition with accounting principles and international standards for determining balance sheet profits or losses.<br><br>The draft seeks to address tax optimization structures using limited partnerships, grant limited partnerships corporate income taxpayer status, ensure verification of settlements by general partnership members, and raise the revenue limit for the 9% CIT rate from €1.2 million to €2 million to support SMEs. The plan is to adopt the draft in Q3 2020.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_715" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_715" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_715" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_716" style="display:none;">On August 25, 2020, the President signed a law from February 14, 2020, amending certain laws to promote healthier consumer choices. This law introduces a "sugar tax" on sweetened and energy drinks, consisting of a fixed charge of 50 gr per liter for drinks with added sugar or sweeteners, 10 gr per liter for those with active substances like caffeine or taurine, and a variable charge of 5 gr per gram of sugar above 5g/100ml. Entities selling drinks to retail outlets or ordering drinks for production are responsible for paying this fee monthly and submitting electronic reports. Late payments incur an additional charge of 50% of the due amount. Revenue from the sugar tax goes to the National Health Fund (96.5%) and the state budget (3.5%).<br><br>The law also amends regulations on alcoholic beverages, introducing a fee for selling alcohol in containers of 300ml or less. This amounts to 25 zł per liter of pure alcohol sold in such small packages. Wholesale alcohol distributors are responsible for calculating and paying this fee semi-annually. Failure to pay incurs penalties of 2000 zł or 11,250 zł depending on the alcohol content of the wholesale permit. Revenue from this alcohol fee is split equally between local municipalities and the National Health Fund. Both the sugar tax and the alcohol fee are set to take effect on January 1, 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_716" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_716" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_716" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_719" style="display:none;">Entrepreneurs frequently question whether changes to lease agreement terms, such as price adjustments or modifications to the scope of the leased asset, necessitate re-evaluation under IFRS 16. This article examines key lease accounting issues for companies reporting under IFRS, excluding Polish accounting law.<br><br>IFRS 16, effective from January 1, 2019, mandates a faithful representation of lease transactions. Its definition of a lease is broader, focusing on the right to use an asset, based on a control model. This means analyzing an asset's disposability and the lessee's ability to derive benefits from its use, within contractual limits. Consequently, service-type contracts previously expensed, like rentals or land use rights, may now qualify as leases under IFRS 16, regardless of their contractual form. The lessee is responsible for assessing lease classification.<br><br>IFRS 16 offers exemptions for short-term leases (12 months or less) and low-value assets, allowing direct expensing. Certain leases, such as those for non-renewable resources or biological assets, are excluded. The standard eliminates the concept of operating leases and off-balance sheet accounting, requiring a comprehensive approach impacting financial reporting, internal controls, and IT systems.<br><br>Key implications for lessees include increased assets and liabilities, altered financial ratios, changed cost classifications (rent, interest, depreciation), impacts on covenants and credit ratings, stakeholder perception, IT system adjustments, and the need for more detailed contract data. Lease terms are based on the irrevocable period plus reasonably certain extension options, requiring reassessment upon significant events. For indefinite-term leases, lessees estimate the term based on various factors.<br><br>At commencement, the lease liability is calculated based on discounted future lease payments. Lease payments include fixed payments, variable payments tied to rates or indexes, residual value guarantees, purchase options if likely to be exercised, and termination penalties if early termination is probable. Changes to contract terms, especially price adjustments, raise questions about whether to account for them as separate leases or modifications. The article offers assistance with recognizing and valuing such contract modifications.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_719" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_719" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_719" style="display:none;"></p>

Avoiding conflicts with tax authorities, the need for corrections, explanations, and additional payments on top of already high tax burdens is a significant challenge today.<br><br>Companies increasingly face these challenges by utilizing outsourcing firms and accounting/auditing/consulting offices for periodic reviews of accounting books and tax declarations, as well as audits of employee files and payroll calculations. The goal isn't to replace trusted accountants but to gain an independent perspective, gain insight into areas lacking time, and receive consultations on complex regulations. External specialists can also identify potential improvements, automation, and increased efficiency across various company processes by leveraging their knowledge of different industries, IT systems, and financial operations.<br><br>While such reviews can reveal irregularities or knowledge gaps, it's always better to address issues late than never.<br><br>Key aspects of HR/payroll audits include: verifying internal regulations; completeness and correctness of employee documentation (medical certificates, safety training, employment certificates, leave records); proper settlement of business trips and car usage agreements; verification of benefit calculations and working time; and correctness of payroll components.<br><br>Key aspects of accounting reviews include: reviewing accounting policies; checking amortization plans and their accounting/tax treatment; verifying sales invoice accuracy and completeness of warehouse circulation documents; verifying the tax treatment of non-standard operations (car settlements, leases, loans, grants); checking accounts with tax offices, social security, and employees; and verifying corporate income tax and VAT calculations. The scope is tailored to each company's size and potential issues.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_721" style="display:none;">Upcoming changes in VAT – SLIM VAT<br><br>Deputy Minister of Finance Jan Sarnowski described SLIM VAT as "a simple, modern tax adapted to local specifics." He explained that Polish specifics include many small and medium-sized enterprises that handle their own tax settlements, and with technological advancements, many obligations and regulations are losing relevance. Large companies are also expected to benefit from the changes. For them, SLIM VAT means simplification of financial and accounting department work and time savings, resulting in tangible financial benefits for businesses.<br><br>The main areas of change include simplifications in invoicing, exports, and currency exchange rates.<br><br>Simplified Invoicing:<br>Corrections in invoicing (in-minus): Reduced invoicing registration obligations. Entrepreneurs will be exempt from the formal requirement of obtaining confirmation of receipt of a correcting invoice from the buyer. Taxpayers will lower the tax base and VAT due in the period of issuing the correcting invoice, provided their documentation shows agreement with the buyer on transaction terms. The buyer will be obliged to make a corresponding correction of input tax.<br><br>Corrections in invoicing (in-plus): The VAT Act will introduce provisions specifying how to settle correcting invoices that increase the tax base. Previously, taxpayers relied on interpretations and case law, leading to legal uncertainty. Now, taxpayers will gain certainty, with settlements made currently in the period the correcting invoice is issued.<br><br>Export Simplifications:<br>The period for applying the zero VAT rate on advance payments for goods exported outside the EU will be extended from 2 to 6 months. This aims to ensure the neutrality of advance payments in exports, facilitating trade, especially eastward.<br><br>Currency Exchange Rate Rules:<br>Taxpayers will be able to choose a common currency exchange rate for calculating revenue in both VAT and income tax. This will reduce the time spent determining separate rates for different taxes on the same transaction, eliminating discrepancies between VAT and CIT calculations.<br><br>Other financial benefits include:<br>Extended period for deducting VAT to four months.<br>Deducting VAT on invoices for accommodation services purchased for resale.<br>Increased limit for low-value gifts.<br><br>Deputy Minister Sarnowski announced that the project has concluded internal consultations and is planned to come into effect in the first months of 2021.<br><br>Summary:<br>Poland is introducing "SLIM VAT," a package of reforms aimed at simplifying the VAT system for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. Deputy Minister of Finance Jan Sarnowski highlighted that the changes will streamline invoicing, export procedures, and currency exchange rate calculations, benefiting companies of all sizes by reducing administrative burdens and saving time.<br><br>Key simplifications include easier correction of invoices, both reducing and increasing VAT amounts, with clearer rules for timing and buyer acknowledgment. For exports outside the EU, the period for applying a zero VAT rate on advance payments will be extended from two to six months, supporting international trade. A significant change allows taxpayers to use a single currency exchange rate for both VAT and income tax calculations, eliminating previous discrepancies and speeding up compliance. The reforms also extend the VAT deduction period to four months, permit VAT deduction on accommodation services for resale, and increase the limit for low-value gifts. These measures are expected to be implemented in early 2021, fostering a more efficient and modern tax environment.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_721" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_721" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_721" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_722" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Finance has released a draft amendment to the Corporate Income Tax Act and other related laws for pre-consultation, introducing provisions for the so-called Estonian CIT. This model, planned to be implemented from January 2021, shifts the taxation of corporate profits. Under the Estonian CIT model, corporate income taxpayers will not pay advance tax payments or annual tax settlements. Instead, CIT will only be payable upon the distribution of profits.<br><br>This solution is intended for small and medium-sized limited liability companies and joint-stock companies. Eligibility criteria include: annual revenues not exceeding PLN 50 million, shareholders being exclusively individuals, no ownership stakes in other entities, employment of at least 3 individuals besides shareholders, passive income not exceeding operational income, and demonstrating investment expenditures. Taxpayers can opt for the Estonian CIT model for a period of 4 years, with the possibility of extension for subsequent 4-year periods.<br><br>The Ministry of Finance has also published FAQs on the Estonian CIT. It clarifies that separate tax accounting records will not be required, as financial accounting will suffice for tax calculation. However, certain reporting obligations remain, such as filing tax returns and paying tax following dividend distribution or other profit distributions, or non-business-related payments. It is advisable to monitor the final form of these regulations to assess their attractiveness for businesses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_722" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_722" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_722" style="display:none;"></p>

For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), an additional condition is reporting a loss on sales (25% forgiveness), alongside the other two. Funds can only cover business operating costs, including salaries, goods/services, external financing costs, public liabilities, rent, fixed asset purchases, and repayment of existing loans (up to 25% of the subsidy).

The inquiry also questions the lack of clarity regarding the tax treatment of these aid programs and asks if the ministry plans to introduce tax exemptions to ensure the aid is truly beneficial.<br><br>Deputy Finance Minister Jan Sarnowski responded, clarifying that financial assistance from the Polish Development Fund (PFR) is treated as a loan, not income. Receiving the loan is tax-neutral. However, any forgiven portion of the loan is considered taxable income. The Ministry is considering partial tax exemptions for these loan forgiveness amounts in 2021. As for the one-time 5000 zł loan for micro-entrepreneurs, while receiving the loan is tax-neutral, the COVID-19 act specifically exempts the forgiven amount from income tax. Regarding waived ZUS contributions, these cannot be deducted as expenses because they were not paid by the entrepreneur. However, the waiver itself is exempt from income tax.

Taxpayers can reduce the income constituting the basis for the advance payment by the value of receivables included in revenue that has not been settled or sold, when 90 days have passed from the payment deadline specified on the invoice (bill) or in the contract, until the period in which the receivable was settled or sold (Article 25 section 19 point 1 of the Corporate Income Tax Act, Article 44 section 17 point 1 of the Personal Income Tax Act). The Anti-Crisis Shield 4.0 indicates that in 2020, the right to reduce the income constituting the basis for calculating the advance payment is granted starting from the settlement period in which 30 days have passed from the payment deadline.<br><br>This possibility will also be provided for taxpayers who have chosen a simplified form of paying advances for 2020.

Contractual penalties and compensations related to defective goods or services are generally not tax-deductible. However, an exception is made if the defect or delay resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the "bad debt relief" has become more favorable for creditors. Starting January 1, 2020, creditors can reduce their income tax base by the value of unsettled receivables after a certain period. Initially, this period was 90 days, but it was shortened to 30 days in 2020 due to the Anti-Crisis Shield 4.0, with specific reduction percentages depending on the taxpayer's income tax bracket (CIT or PIT) and size. The reduced period applies to taxpayers experiencing negative economic consequences from COVID-19 and not debtors.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_730" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_730" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_730" style="display:none;"></p>

Article 53 modifies the Law on Entrepreneurs, allowing for remote controls with the entrepreneur's consent. This enables authorities to conduct audits via postal service or electronic communication if it streamlines the process or suits the business's nature.<br><br>The legislator aims to make controls more flexible, addressing entrepreneurs' concerns about disruptions. Remote audits are applicable when physical presence isn't necessary, documentation can be analyzed remotely, or the remote approach is more efficient.<br><br>Tax authorities must still notify entrepreneurs of planned audits at least 7 days prior, as per the Tax Ordinance, unless the entrepreneur consents to a faster audit or specific circumstances allow unannounced checks. The possibility of a remote audit depends entirely on the entrepreneur's consent.

A copy of the residency certificate can be used to confirm the taxpayer's residence for tax purposes if its information doesn't raise doubts about its accuracy. For certificates without an expiration date, expiring within the epidemic period, payers can consider them valid throughout the epidemic and two months after. Furthermore, the requirement for the payer to obtain a residency certificate from the taxpayer is also considered fulfilled if the payer possesses a certificate covering 2019 and a statement from the taxpayer confirming the data's current accuracy.<br><br>The deadline for submitting information on transfer pricing and declarations regarding local transfer pricing documentation is extended to December 31, 2020, if the original deadline falls between March 31 and September 30, 2020.

This guide explains how to approach such scenarios.<br><br>**Why Care?**<br><br>Annual asset value verification is a legal requirement under both Polish Accounting Law (Art. 28 UoR, KSR4) and international standards (IAS 36).<br><br>**Where to Start?**<br><br>While the list of indicators for potential impairment is extensive, it's also open-ended. KSR4 mandates "professional judgment," meaning common sense and experience, which can be subjective.<br><br>Begin by reviewing the indicators and assessing if any apply to your situation. Meeting just one indicator necessitates further steps. Some indicators might require in-depth analysis. Investing time or seeking external support at this stage can be beneficial, as it might prevent more costly or labor-intensive procedures later.<br><br>Evaluate the indicators that apply based on their time and monetary impact, discarding those with temporary or minor financial consequences. These can be broadly categorized.<br><br>**What Does It Entail?**<br><br>The process is straightforward:<br><br>*   **Test:** Remember, only one method needs to yield a value higher than the book value.<br>*   **Result:** Ensure the test outcome is properly accounted for to avoid future complications, such as by creating an adjusted depreciation plan.<br><br>**Who Is Responsible?**<br><br>The management board, typically the finance department, is responsible. The accountant/CFO's role is to ensure these individuals conduct and document the test (e.g., a note signed by management or a more detailed report).<br><br>"Market value" requires an appraisal, often performed by an expert or auditor. "Economic value" involves calculating "expected cash flows from the asset group," which can be complex if accounting systems aren't set up for such analyses, potentially requiring auditor assistance.<br><br>**Example:**<br><br>In Q1 2020, Company A halted production, incurred significant losses, and:<br><br>*   In Q2 2020, returned to profitability. Here, indicators suggest a temporary situation, even if the full year 2020 results in a loss.<br>*   In Q2 2020, losses decreased, but the timeline for profitability recovery was uncertain. The factory was new. Indicators were met, but a market value test would conclude positively if it demonstrated the factory could be sold for more than its book value.<br><br>The test for permanent asset impairment.<br><br>---<br><br>Declining profitability, operational cutbacks, or other adverse circumstances can devalue assets intended for profit. This guide outlines the approach to such situations. Annual asset value verification is mandated by both Polish accounting law and international standards (IAS 36). The process begins with reviewing indicators of potential impairment. Professional judgment is required, and even one applicable indicator necessitates further steps. It's advisable to conduct a thorough analysis or seek external expertise early to avoid greater costs later. Evaluate indicators based on their time and monetary impact, discarding those with minor or temporary effects. The core of the process involves testing asset values, where only one method needs to exceed the book value. Proper accounting for the test results is crucial to prevent future issues. Management, particularly the finance department, is responsible for conducting and documenting the test, with the accountant/CFO overseeing this. Market value requires appraisal, while economic value involves complex cash flow calculations, potentially needing auditor assistance. An example illustrates a scenario where production halts and losses occur, but subsequent recovery or sale potential can impact the impairment test outcome.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_733" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_733" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_733" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_735" style="display:none;">A new version of the anti-crisis shield introduces significant changes for self-employed individuals and those on civil law contracts regarding benefit eligibility. Previously, dual social insurance prevented eligibility for standby benefits. Now, this is permissible, with benefit entitlement solely dependent on a turnover decrease or business suspension after January 31, 2020.<br><br>Shield 4.0 offers entrepreneurs new avenues for support. A subsidy for employees not on downtime or reduced hours will be available, covering up to half their wages (capped at 40% of the average monthly salary). This requires a 15% turnover drop over two consecutive months post-January 1, 2020, compared to the previous year, or a 25% drop in any month compared to the preceding one.<br><br>The proposed legislation extends the possibility of introducing downtime or reduced working hours (up to 20% reduction, not exceeding 0.5 FTE) for up to 12 months. This is contingent on a significant increase in the wage fund burden, defined as a 5% rise in the ratio of wage costs (including employer social security contributions) to sales revenue in a given month compared to the previous one, starting from March 1, 2020. Tax changes include accelerated "bad debt relief," allowing deductions after 30 days of non-payment for businesses affected by the pandemic, and the deductibility of penalties and compensation paid to contractors due to COVID-19. Tax scheme reporting deadlines are also extended. A new simplified restructuring procedure is introduced for struggling businesses.<br><br>The draft also proposes legal regulation for "credit holidays," allowing a 3-month suspension of loan installments for those who lost employment or primary income after March 13, 2020, extending the loan term.<br><br>These changes are part of a broader government package. Notably, the new shield does not include further exemptions from ZUS contributions. The bill is scheduled for parliamentary debate on May 27.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_735" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_735" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_735" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_738" style="display:none;">To address taxpayers, on May 6, 2020, the Sejm adopted an amendment to the PIT, CIT, VAT, and Tax Ordinance acts. The government claims these new regulations will simplify taxpayers' obligations, reducing disputes between taxpayers and tax authorities.<br><br>A key change in the amended CIT and VAT draft is the exemption from the requirement to check the white list for bank accounts. Currently, payments to accounts not on the list exceeding PLN 15,000 are not deductible expenses. Following the planned changes, when using split payment, amounts paid to non-listed accounts will be deductible. The amendment also allows for retroactive application of sanctions relief in PIT and CIT for payments made since January 1, 2020.<br><br>The project also facilitates the non-application of joint and several liability rules for payments made to accounts not on the VAT taxpayer list, but to bank accounts or cooperative savings and credit union accounts used for receivables settlement, payment collection on behalf of sellers, or internal operations, provided the bank or credit union informs the taxpayer about the account's nature. Joint and several liability will also be excluded if payment is made via split payment or relates to intra-community acquisitions, imports, or reverse-charge transactions.<br><br>Furthermore, the deadline for notifying the tax office about payments to non-listed accounts (ZAWR-NR) will be extended from 3 to 7 days (14 days during the epidemic). The responsible tax office will also change, shifting from the invoice issuer's tax office to the taxpayer's tax office. A single notification will suffice for multiple payments to the same non-listed account. These changes, passed by the Sejm and sent to the Senate, are planned to take effect on July 1.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_738" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_738" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_738" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_739" style="display:none;">In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, the Polish government announced the possibility of filing tax returns later. While the general deadline for annual PIT returns is April 30th, filing between April 30th and May 31st will be considered an act of remorse, avoiding penalties for late submission. A government regulation exempts taxpayers from penalties for filing PIT returns and settling their tax obligations by June 1st, 2020. This applies to PIT-37, PIT-36, PIT-36S, PIT-36L, PIT-36LS, PIT-38, and PIT-39 forms.<br><br>For those using the "Twój e-PIT" service for PIT-37 and PIT-38, automatically prepared returns will be accepted if no action is taken by April 30th. After this date, only corrections will be possible. Importantly, filing after the April 30th deadline does not preclude taxpayers from utilizing tax reliefs and deductions, including joint filing with a spouse or as a single parent, internet relief, thermomodernization relief, child relief, rehabilitation relief, and the IP BOX preferential tax rate for intellectual property income. The government encourages timely filing despite the extended grace period.<br><br>In summary, Poland has extended the filing period for certain tax returns until June 1st, 2020, without penalty due to COVID-19. This allows taxpayers to still claim various tax reliefs and deductions, even if they file after the original April 30th deadline. The "Twój e-PIT" service will automatically accept filings for PIT-37 and PIT-38 if no action is taken by April 30th, but corrections will be possible later. Despite these accommodations, timely filing is still encouraged.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_739" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_739" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_739" style="display:none;"></p>

This is crucial as it determines the percentage of PFR aid that may be forgiven. This is important for every company, even if the forgiveness occurs months later. Whether you are an SME or a large corporation, this problem awaits if you choose to accept the eagerly awaited aid, which is essential for many businesses to recover from the crisis.<br><br>According to PFR guidelines (pages 14, 19, and 21), cash loss is likely the transition from net profit to net cash flow.

For companies in sectors with significant invested assets, like infrastructure companies, financing costs and asset depreciation can be included.<br><br>The description is imprecise, especially regarding full cash accounting. However, it necessitates detailed analysis and future projections. For large companies, liquidity financing is granted based on a projected liquidity gap caused by COVID-19, up to PLN 1 billion. SMEs with full cash accounting define sales loss as net sales loss in the income statement, excluding depreciation, provisions, write-downs, or asset revaluation/sale results. Large companies' loss assessment is based on estimated cash sales loss, excluding depreciation, provisions, write-downs, or asset revaluation/sale results.

While economic activity is slowly resuming in China outside of quarantined areas, maintain a critical perspective on media reports, remembering that expert predictions are often inaccurate. Calmly analyze your business without making rash decisions, as your clients are watching. Utilize existing resources as needed.<br><br>Review fixed costs, cutting non-essential expenses like subscriptions or excessive marketing, but carefully consider the impact before eliminating services entirely. Renegotiate contracts for rent and services if your transaction volume decreases significantly. Analyze variable costs and identify alternative suppliers. Reduce inventory by selling surplus items to generate cash flow. Consider selling or leasing out unnecessary assets to improve liquidity.<br><br>Explore options for loans and deferring payments. Communicate proactively with your bank about your situation to improve negotiation leverage. Optimize leases by postponing payments or transferring agreements. Consider sale-leaseback options if financial difficulties arise. Defer all possible payments, including taxes and supplier debts, until your business recovers.<br><br>Maintain open communication with suppliers and clients to build trust and keep them informed about your plans. Monitor competitors and larger companies for innovative solutions. Avoid expensive financing options like credit cards and factoring.

Explore options for employees, such as furloughs or using accrued vacation time. Consider reorganization or reduced salaries, in consultation with your employees. Collaborate with other businesses to share resources and employees. Consider how you can support your customers, such as payment deferrals or equipment rentals. Pay attention to government support programs as the EU will financially assist countries in response to the coronavirus pandemic and companies may benefit from this support.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_742" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_742" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_742" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_745" style="display:none;">This article discusses the tax implications of Employee Capital Plans (PPK) in Poland, focusing on contributions, financing entities, and withdrawals. Employer-funded contributions, both mandatory and voluntary, are considered taxable income for the employee and subject to standard income tax. However, government subsidies, including the initial welcome bonus of 250 PLN and annual payments of 240 PLN, are tax-exempt. Employee contributions are deducted from their after-tax salary.<br><br>An example illustrates how PPK contributions affect net pay. Although employees contribute 2% of their gross salary, their net pay decreases by over 3% due to the TEE (Taxed, Exempt, Exempt) model, where employer contributions are taxed upfront. This has led to calls for "grossing up" employer contributions to offset the impact on net pay, which employers resist, arguing it would unfairly shift the financial burden entirely to them. Another point of contention is that bonuses and rewards are included in the gross salary calculation for PPK contributions. While the TEE system results in immediate tax on contributions, future income from withdrawals is tax-exempt. Some PPK participants are skeptical about this arrangement, though government subsidies partially compensate for the lack of upfront tax benefits.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_745" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_745" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_745" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_746" style="display:none;">My dear friends,<br><br>We are slowly closing and settling the year 2019, a year that REWIT will primarily remember as the 25th anniversary of its existence. It became clear how connected we are with Gdańsk and Pomerania. A quarter of a century is a long time – we have survived various trials and fulfilled many dreams and aspirations.<br><br>The founder of the company, my mother – Lucyna Witek – probably did not anticipate that after 25 years we would achieve such success: over 500 clients annually, over 12.6 million PLN in consolidated revenues, 8 offices in Poland, 140 employees, 14th position on the market in the ranking of all audit firms, high growth dynamics. Today we are a medium-sized audit firm, providing a wide range of services to our clients.<br><br>How do we assess these 25 years? Certainly as a time of successes, challenges, and constant changes. We have made many mistakes, gained many strong experiences, searched and made further attempts. However, these experiences are our wealth. They guarantee that we approach our clients' matters with respect and understanding. In 2019, which will be recorded with almost 10% revenue growth in the entire REWIT group, we tried to start the process of standardization and change of the company to better respond to the changing needs of the market.<br><br>The year 2019 was also marked by numerous challenges for us and our clients, mainly changes in tax law, introducing even greater uncertainty among our clients. We strive to support you in tax, reporting, and business matters.<br><br>We want to be an organization that supports medium-sized businesses in their development, we want to be partners who share experiences and best practices. We also want to create a good workplace for the development of all employees and collaborators.<br><br>Thank you to all those who have trusted us. Thank you to all members of the "REWIT family": employees and partners who support our business with their work, development and empathy. Finally, thank you to our families for showing understanding when we happen to put business above other needs.<br><br>The year 2020 is already underway. We know that it will be a very busy period. We have new ambitious goals and challenges ahead of us this year. We hope they will open doors to new international development prospects in the next decade.<br><br>REWIT is celebrating its 25th anniversary, marking a period of substantial growth and evolution from a small firm to a mid-sized audit organization with 8 offices, 140 employees, and over 500 clients, achieving significant revenue milestones and ranking among the top audit firms in Poland. The company acknowledges the challenges and successes of the past, emphasizing its commitment to understanding and supporting its clients through fluctuating market conditions and tax law changes. A key focus is on team building, providing expert advisory services, and fostering a supportive work environment. REWIT aims to be a partner in the growth of medium-sized businesses, sharing best practices and creating opportunities for employee development while expressing gratitude to clients, employees, partners, and families for their trust and support. The company anticipates a busy and ambitious year ahead, focusing on international expansion and continued organizational development.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_746" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_746" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_746" style="display:none;"></p>

For the period October-December 2019, a transitional tax rate of 17.75% is applied. When calculating advance tax payments for income earned from October 1 to December 31, 2019, a 17% rate is used instead of 18%, with a tax-reducing amount of 525.12 PLN.

An increased tax-deductible expense will be applied.The law also increases monthly and annual employee costs.

A taxpayer receiving funds on their 16th birthday who has declared exemption from taxation is eligible for the exemption on income paid that day if they are under 26. The exemption applies to income received until the age of 26, including income received on the 26th birthday.<br><br>2. The Ministry of Finance is planning to amend the PIT-11 form. Work on the draft regulation is in progress, and the draft will be available on the Government Legislation Centre's Public Information Bulletin when it is submitted for consultations and opinions.<br><br>3a. The income limit for tax exemption (PLN 35,636.67 in 2019 and PLN 85,582 from 2020) refers to gross income, not reduced by revenue-generating expenses or deductions from income. However, income subject to lump-sum tax, tax-exempt income, and income with tax collection waived are excluded from this limit.<br><br>3b. When calculating payroll with both salary and ZUS benefits, the tax advance for benefits is calculated without deducting revenue-generating expenses.<br><br>3c. If the exemption limit is exceeded during a tax month, the excess is taxed from the month the exemption eligibility is lost.<br><br>3d. If an individual turns 26 during the year, income received up to their 26th birthday is tax-exempt, while income received afterwards is taxed.<br><br>3e. Exceeding both the exemption limit and the tax threshold are independent events.<br><br>3f. If an employee under 26 works for multiple employers and submits exemption declarations to all, but collectively exceeds the limit, they must calculate the tax due in their tax return. The amount of social security and health insurance contributions deductible from income and tax is determined based on the proportion of exempt income to total income, and information will be included in tax return brochures.<br><br>4a. A payer can deduct revenue-generating expenses from income not exempt due to exceeding the limit.<br><br>4b. Restrictions mentioned in Art. 22 para. 3b and para. 9aa of the PIT Act also apply when collecting tax advances.<br><br>4c. Art. 23 para. 1 point 31 of the PIT Act does not preclude deducting employee wages exempt from taxation as business expenses for the employer because the employee's income is exempt, not the employer's.<br><br>These explanations are based on the response of the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Tadeusz Kościński, on September 5, 2019, to the letter of the Tax Council of the Lewiatan Confederation of August 23, 2019 and do not constitute an official interpretation of tax law.<br><br>## Summary<br><br>The Polish Ministry of Finance clarified several aspects of the tax exemption for individuals under 26. The exemption applies to income received until the 26th birthday, even if received on that day. The Ministry is planning amendments to the PIT-11 form. The income limit for the exemption is gross income, excluding income subject to lump-sum tax, tax-exempt income, and income with waived tax collection. Tax advances on ZUS benefits are calculated without deducting revenue-generating expenses. If the exemption limit is exceeded, the excess is taxed from that month onwards. Individuals turning 26 during the year are only exempt up to their birthday. The exemption limit operates independently of the tax threshold. For employees working for multiple employers and exceeding the collective exemption limit, the deductible social security and health insurance contributions are determined proportionally. Payers can deduct revenue-generating expenses from income not exempt due to exceeding the limit, and certain restrictions apply. The exemption does not preclude deducting exempt employee wages as business expenses for the employer.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_751" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_751" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_751" style="display:none;"></p>

Accessible via the Public Information Bulletin on the Ministry of Finance's website and the Central Registration and Information on Business, it allows verification of a subject's status for any day within the preceding five years. This unified database contains extended information, including bank account numbers listed in identification or update forms, aiming to simplify counterparty verification.<br><br>The register includes company names, tax identification numbers, VAT status, REGON and PESEL numbers, KRS numbers, addresses, details of representatives, registration dates, legal basis for registration/deregistration, and bank account numbers. Taxpayers should verify that the recipient's bank account matches the one listed before making payments. The list is updated daily on business days. Verifying counterparties is crucial for VAT deduction, and the list aids in demonstrating due diligence.<br><br>From January 2020, failure to verify the white list carries consequences under income tax laws. Payments to accounts not listed could result in joint liability for the supplier's unpaid VAT and the inability to deduct the expense for income tax purposes for transactions exceeding PLN 15,000. A notification within 3 days of payment to an unlisted account can avoid these consequences. A new provision introduces joint and several liability for VAT arrears if payments are made to unlisted accounts.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_752" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_752" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_752" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_754" style="display:none;">The Polish government is processing an amendment to the VAT law concerning the 0% VAT rate for intra-Community transactions, chain transactions, and call-off stock arrangements. These changes introduce material conditions for applying the 0% VAT rate on intra-Community supplies, focusing on the buyer's valid VAT identification number and the accurate submission of summary information by the supplier.<br><br>Effective January 1, 2020, Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1912 mandates proper proof of goods' export from one member state to another to qualify for the 0% rate. For instance, if a third party handles the transport, the seller must possess at least two consistent documents, such as a CMR and a carrier's invoice, issued by independent entities unrelated to the buyer and seller.<br><br>Regarding chain transactions, the concept of an intermediary entity will be introduced, allowing the attribution of goods' dispatch or transport to deliveries made to that entity, which is crucial for determining the reporting obligations of each party involved. The new regulations replace existing rules on consignment warehouses with new procedures for call-off stock, where goods are intended for a specific recipient. Goods stored in a call-off stock exceeding 12 months without being retrieved will trigger a tax liability for the supplier. The changes will take effect on January 1, 2020.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_754" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_754" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_754" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_755" style="display:none;">The text discusses the tax implications of Employee Capital Plans (PPK) in Poland, focusing on contributions made by employers, the state, and employees. Employer-funded contributions are considered taxable income, subject to general income tax rules. State contributions, including the welcome bonus and annual top-ups, are tax-exempt. Employee contributions are deducted from net salary, meaning they are made after income tax has been applied.<br><br>An example illustrates how PPK contributions affect an employee's net pay. Even though the basic contribution is 2% of gross salary, the net salary decreases by over 3% due to the taxation model where the employer's contribution is taxed. This leads to calls for employers to "gross up" salaries to compensate for the employee contributions. Employers are reluctant to do so, arguing that it would place the entire financial burden of PPK on them, contrary to the law's intention of shared responsibility. The calculation of the PPK contribution base includes bonuses and awards, which adds to the financial impact on employees.<br><br>PPK, along with other third-pillar pension schemes, operates under a TEE (taxed, exempt, exempt) model, where contributions are made from taxed income, but future payouts are tax-free. While the lack of immediate tax benefits raises concerns among some, state subsidies partially offset this. The article concludes with an invitation to contact the author for more information.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_755" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_755" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_755" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_761" style="display:none;">The legal situation concerning VAT deductions for accommodation and catering services changed on December 1, 2008, when amendments to the VAT Act were introduced. Previously, tourism service providers could deduct VAT on these services. However, after the amendment, this right was revoked, with Article 88(1)(4)(b) of the VAT Act prohibiting deductions for accommodation and catering services, except for meals provided to passengers by transport companies.<br><br>A CJEU ruling clarified that the prohibition was permissible from May 1, 2004, to December 1, 2008, as it mirrored existing restrictions at Poland's EU accession. However, extending this prohibition to all taxpayers from December 1, 2008, and thus removing the deduction right for tourism service providers, violated an EU directive. The ruling emphasizes that the purpose of acquiring accommodation and catering services is crucial for determining the right to deduct input VAT.<br><br>This CJEU judgment opens avenues for taxpayers, especially tourism service providers not under the margin VAT system, to adjust their past VAT returns for periods not subject to prescription. Those with ongoing proceedings can directly cite the CJEU’s guidance to tax authorities. Individuals with final decisions can apply for reopening proceedings within a month of the CJEU ruling's publication. The Ministry of Finance will issue a supplementary position after a ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court in a case that led to the CJEU referral, which will further define "tourism services" relevant to this deduction right. Tax advisors have been representing clients in these matters and highlight the CJEU ruling's impact on disputes with tax administrations regarding VAT deductions for accommodation and catering services for tourism providers.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_761" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_761" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_761" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_762" style="display:none;">There are two main options for entrepreneurs acquiring a car for business use: purchasing for cash or leasing.<br><br>When purchasing for cash, the tax-deductible depreciation is capped based on a vehicle value of 150,000 PLN (225,000 PLN for electric vehicles). The vehicle's value includes the purchase price plus non-deductible VAT. Therefore, if only 50% of VAT is deductible, the remaining portion increases the car's value and subsequently affects deductible depreciation, remaining within the 150,000 PLN limit.<br><br>Alternatively, leasing allows for tax-deductible lease payments proportional to the 150,000 PLN limit compared to the car's value. Crucially, non-deductible VAT on lease payments, according to CIT and PIT laws, can be included as a tax-deductible expense without being subject to the 150,000 PLN limit, as it doesn't increase the asset's value. This interpretation, based on the clear wording of the CIT act, seemingly permits deducting the unrecovered VAT regardless of the 150,000 PLN threshold in leasing scenarios. Official clarification from the Ministry is anticipated to confirm this position in forthcoming tax explanations regarding business car usage.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_762" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_762" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_762" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_763" style="display:none;">The judgment will primarily have tax implications for fuel card issuers, typically leasing companies or fleet management firms that negotiate better fuel prices, and their clients. The established scheme involves users purchasing fuel tax-free with cards, with the fuel company invoicing the card issuer. The card issuer then invoices the end-user, whose employees used the fuel. Previously, each transaction was treated as a supply of goods (fuel) with VAT, allowing both the card issuer and the end-user to deduct this VAT.<br><br>However, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that a company financing fuel purchases for subsidiaries is providing a credit service, not possessing or reselling the fuel as an owner. Therefore, providing fuel cards is considered a service, not a supply of goods. Consequently, the card issuer and its clients cannot claim back VAT paid on invoices documenting these transactions. This ruling may lead tax authorities to scrutinize fuel card users' tax settlements, potentially disallowing VAT deductions on fuel supply invoices if the CJEU's stance is applied. The CJEU ruling (case C-235/18) does not apply to cards issued directly by fuel companies to final customers, as these are direct supplies of goods.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_763" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_763" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_763" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_764" style="display:none;">I noted with great surprise our jump of four positions from 18th to 14th. The surprise stemmed from the fact that in 2018, our development focused mainly on other services, such as tax advisory and accounting services. Audit, as a department, while developing, concentrated on compliance issues due to two planned inspections: by the Audit Supervision Committee and the National Supervisory Commission. The inspections went well, but they consumed us greatly. However, our attention to good growth foundations paid off. With changed ranking criteria, we grew by 4 positions… I don’t know if this is the last such significant growth, but I’m happy we managed it.<br><br>I sincerely thank all our clients who have trusted us, our employees, managers, partners, and the community of colleagues who support us daily. Thanks to you, we are changing, I hope for the better, not only by developing but by improving in various aspects of our activities.<br><br>On April 11th, I had the opportunity to participate in the second CFO Summit Conference organized by CIMA and AICPA, where the role of digitalization and leadership was emphasized. As an organization, we have much to do regarding digitalization, although the concepts of cloud computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are familiar to us. We see, however, that we want to follow changes in leadership, in building a healthy work environment where people care for each other, are not indifferent to the needs of others, both colleagues and clients, and want to build positive human relationships. We are working on this; we want to develop these skills because we spend over 1/3 of our time at work, and by building good relationships, we improve our comfort of life, satisfaction, and strengthen positive communication not only in business but also in life.<br><br>The road ahead is before us. Many challenges await us, but it is worth working for moments of success, worth building a team that I am proud of, even if difficult times sometimes obscure the sun and we forget its warm rays.<br><br>Thank you once again… and knowing our plans, I believe that in reality, we have just begun, and the question arises as to how far we will go together.

We express gratitude to clients, employees, managers, partners, and colleagues for their trust and support, which fuels our continuous improvement.<br><br>Attending the CFO Summit highlighted the importance of digitalization and leadership. While familiar with advanced technologies, we are actively focusing on developing leadership skills and fostering a positive work environment.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_765" style="display:none;">One legal method for optimizing tax liability from employment, personal services, service contracts, and commissioned work is by applying increased income-earning costs. This deviates from the standard practice where these costs for such taxpayers are only 1,335 PLN (adjusted for commuting). The legislator has introduced two increased flat rates for these costs: 50% and 20%. This material focuses on the 50% rate. It's crucial to note that this tax preference can only be applied to specific income types, primarily related to creative and artistic activities, research and development, and certain academic roles.<br><br>While the group eligible for the 50% rate was narrowed in 2018, it still includes professionals in fields like architecture, various arts, computer programming, journalism, museum work, conservation, translation, and R&D. A key limitation is that the 50% costs in a tax year cannot exceed 85,528 PLN, which is the upper limit of the first tax bracket. Beyond the restricted eligibility, taxpayers face interpretational challenges from the National Fiscal Information, particularly regarding separating core employment remuneration from copyright transfer fees, timekeeping for creative work, and calculating author's fees.<br><br>A draft general interpretation from the Ministry of Finance in January 2019 aimed to clarify the application of 50% costs to employment income related to copyright, but its final version remains unpublished. Despite limitations, there's a real possibility to reduce taxes in specific sectors. However, it's vital to be aware of both statutory restrictions and diverse interpretations. Consulting a tax advisor before implementing this optimization strategy is recommended to minimize tax risk.<br><br>agnieszka.drozdz-wilk@moorepolska.pl</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_765" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_765" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_765" style="display:none;"></p>

Additionally, they pay minimum lump-sum social security contributions. According to a Ministry representative, cases of individuals working solely for one contractor often represent "sham" entrepreneurship: "They work for one company and issue one invoice per month. Moreover, they often have a non-compete clause. I don't know any real entrepreneurs who would agree to a non-compete clause."<br><br>The Ministry aims to combat individuals who register sole proprietorships and pay lower taxes, which it considers unfair to those paying taxes and contributions on employment contracts while performing the same tasks as those operating as businesses. The proposed solution is the "entrepreneur test," which would determine who is a genuine entrepreneur. However, details of the test's design and the timeline for its implementation remain undisclosed.<br><br>This plan represents a tool in the ongoing struggle between taxpayers and the tax authorities. The authorities have repeatedly referenced the definition of economic activity to argue that certain sole proprietors do not meet the criteria to be considered entrepreneurs and should be taxed as employees under the progressive tax scale. Currently, such disputes often end up in administrative courts. The planned tool would enable tax authorities to determine much earlier how an individual's income should be taxed, obviously benefiting the state budget.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_768" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_768" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_768" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_770" style="display:none;">The proposed legislation aims to replace the current VAT-7 and VAT-7K declarations with a new single file, JPK_VDEK. This expanded JPK file will consolidate all necessary data, eliminating the need for separate VAT declarations and simplifying reporting for taxpayers. The Ministry of Finance anticipates this change will significantly reduce the administrative burden and simplify tax settlements with the fiscal authorities. Businesses will now submit only one monthly or quarterly document without additional attachments.<br><br>However, the draft also introduces strict penalties for errors within the JPK files. Taxpayers will face a 500 PLN fine for each uncorrected mistake within 14 days of a tax office notification, with an exception for individuals if they face separate criminal liability for the same offense. Furthermore, the Fiscal Penal Code will be amended to include penalties of up to 240 daily rates for late or inaccurate submissions. The Ministry of Finance acknowledges concerns regarding these penalties and is considering measures, such as guidelines or statutory exclusions, to avoid punishing minor errors. The primary goal is to combat tax fraud, particularly carousel fraud and the use of "empty" invoices, by encouraging accurate JPK submissions that enable analytical and control functions. Minor mistakes, like typos in addresses, are intended to be differentiated from errors that hinder the system's analytical capabilities.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_770" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_770" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_770" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_772" style="display:none;">Due to inaccuracies in many online resources, the following points are clarified:<br><br>1.  Employers can choose to maintain employee records in either paper or electronic form.<br>2.  Employers can switch between these formats at any time.<br>3.  The adaptation period primarily concerns the basic ABC document classifications, with additions of category D and minor adjustments to the register, allowing 12 months for implementation, not for the introduction of electronic records entirely. Records can continue to be maintained as before, requiring only reordering according to the new register and addition of the "D" category.<br>4.  Record retention periods: 50 years for employees hired before January 1, 1999, and those with specific data (e.g., miners); 10 years for employees hired from January 1, 2019, or between 1999-2018, provided a ZUS OSW and RIA report are filed. Failure to file extends the retention to 50 years. The ZUS OSW statement can be submitted at any time but can only be withdrawn before the first ZUS RIA report is filed. Once the first RIA report is filed, all subsequent reports must be completed.<br>5.  The statement regarding the certificate of employment can take two forms: an additional point in the certificate or additional information stating the record retention period, the employee's right to collect the documentation by the end of the month following the retention period, and that the documentation will be destroyed if not collected.<br>6.  If an employer chooses to change the format of employee records, they must inform employees about the change and their right to collect their previous documentation within 30 days.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_772" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_772" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_772" style="display:none;"></p>

This means taxpayers don't need to re-enter information. The tool allows for the completion of the PIT tax return for 2018 without the need for manual filling and submission.<br><br>It generates electronic tax returns based on data received from employers (such as PIT-8C, PIT-11) and previous years' tax filings (including bank account numbers and child relief details). Taxpayers can choose to use the e-PIT prepared by the tax administration or complete their return independently. If no action is taken by the April 30th deadline, the KAS-prepared return is automatically accepted.<br><br>This service is available for individuals who are not self-employed and those with capital gains income (filing PIT-37 or PIT-38). For other tax return types (PIT-36, PIT-36L, PIT-28), the service will be available for tax year 2019. Importantly, returns are personalized, allowing taxpayers to change their filing status to joint with a spouse or as a single parent. Tax returns prepared by KAS are available from February 15th to April 30th on the Tax Portal. Electronic filing shortens tax refund periods to 45 days. If a taxpayer owes taxes and doesn't act, their return is auto-accepted, and they will receive notification of payment due within 7 days of receipt, with no interest charged during this period.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_773" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_773" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_773" style="display:none;"></p>

Companies operating on a calendar-year fiscal cycle must comply by March 31, 2019. These e-statements require secure electronic signatures from both the preparer and all KRS-registered representatives, including auditors if applicable. This new system presents initial challenges, including familiarization with new tools, obtaining digital signatures for all board members, and adapting to the new reporting format. While posing logistical hurdles, particularly for businesses without external accounting support, the shift promises enhanced financial transparency, facilitating improved monitoring of business partners and bolstering economic security. Non-compliance can lead to fines or imprisonment, emphasizing the need for businesses to update systems, expand knowledge, and fulfill these updated requirements. The new solutions enable easier monitoring of financial results of business partners and therefore improving security.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_774" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_774" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_774" style="display:none;"></p>

However, due to the reporting obligations in income taxes being fulfilled after the tax year ends, transitional provisions specify the application date, even if it coincides with the law's effective date. Reporting obligations, although fulfilled post-tax year, are a consequence of the prior year's tax obligation. References to applying the law to income from a specific date mean applying it to determine the tax liability for that tax year and the subsequent reporting obligations.<br><br>Article 44(1) of the amending law doesn't abolish prior obligations but addresses intertemporal issues related to implementing changes. For corporate income taxpayers with non-calendar tax years that began before January 1, 2019, and end after December 31, 2018, the previous regulations apply until the end of their tax year. The new regulations apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2018, reflecting the constitutional principle against retroactive law.<br><br>The fact that repealed regulations are no longer in effect when reporting for the previous year is irrelevant; the crucial factor is the period the obligation pertains to. For transfer pricing obligations for 2018, the regulations in effect that year generally apply.<br><br>However, Article 44(2) allows opting for the new regulations for all controlled transactions in 2018, precluding simultaneous application of both sets of rules. The TP-R form doesn't apply to 2018, instead, the CIT/TP or PIT/TP form is required.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_775" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_775" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_775" style="display:none;"></p>

The changes primarily concern three key areas: the limit for including the cost of purchasing a passenger car in income tax expenses, restrictions on including operating expenses for company cars used for both business and private purposes, and a limit for private cars not listed in the fixed asset register.<br><br>The limit for deducting passenger car acquisition costs is now capped at 225,000 PLN for electric vehicles and 150,000 PLN for other cars, replacing the previous 20,000 EUR limit. This limit applies to depreciation and operational leasing installments; however, agreements before January 1, 2019, remain under the old rules unless amended. Only the capital part of the leasing agreement is subject to the limit, while the interest portion is considered an operating expense.<br><br>Regarding company cars used for both business and private purposes, only 75% of operating expenses (fuel, repairs, highway tolls, parking fees) can be included in income tax expenses. If a car is used solely for business, 100% can be included with a vehicle mileage log, but inaccuracies can result in the 75% limit being applied retroactively. For private cars used for business, a flat 20% of operating expenses can be included as income tax expenses, replacing the mileage allowance, without the need for a vehicle mileage log.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_776" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_776" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_776" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_780" style="display:none;">IFRS 16 is a significant shift, not just a terminology update, potentially requiring renegotiation of existing agreements and impacting IT systems and financial planning KPIs. While effective since January 1, 2019, some entities are only now assessing its scale.<br><br>IFRS 16 applies to entities under IFRS standards, excluding specific asset types like biological assets and intellectual property licenses, agreements below $5,000, and those lasting 12 months or less. However, determining contract value and duration necessitates understanding new IFRS 16 definitions.<br><br>The definition of a lease is similar to IAS 17 but shifts from "risks and rewards" to guidelines considering benefits from the asset and its independence from other assets. This can reclassify agreements as leases and separate leasing and operational components. Applying IFRS 15 principles helps allocate contract prices. However, lessees can opt not to separate operational elements. Lease terms include optional periods if extension is likely.<br><br>Preparing for IFRS 16 involves understanding its impact on financial statements, particularly the balance sheet, which will reflect all leases as assets and liabilities. This can inflate balance sheet totals, increase EBITDA, raise debt ratios, and reduce asset profitability, possibly necessitating renegotiation of financing agreements with "frozen GAAP" clauses. Simulation and scenario planning are recommended. More detailed lease data management might require dedicated software beyond Excel.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_780" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_780" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_780" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_781" style="display:none;">In practice, recently, I had the opportunity to consider the question of whether a taxpayer, a joint-stock company, is obligated to prepare tax documentation when it repurchases its own shares for redemption. This situation is governed by Article 362 § 1 point 5 of the Commercial Companies Code, which prohibits companies from acquiring their own shares, with an exception for acquisition for the purpose of redemption.<br><br>The transaction involved related parties, specifically the company repurchasing shares from its majority shareholder. The conditions for preparing transfer pricing documentation, as per Article 9a of the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Act (e.g., revenue thresholds, materiality), were met, raising the question of whether documentation was required for this type of transaction.<br><br>The author's initial doubts stemmed from the purpose of transfer pricing documentation, which is to ensure that conditions between related parties do not differ from those between independent parties (linking to Article 11 of the CIT Act). However, a share redemption transaction can only occur between related parties, meaning there are no comparable transactions between independent entities to benchmark against.<br><br>Historically, tax authorities, based on individual interpretations (e.g., relating to share redemption), agreed that transfer pricing rules did not apply to voluntary share redemptions because they are exclusively between related parties, precluding independent comparables. However, the tax authority's stance recently shifted. In a new interpretation, the tax authority deemed voluntary share redemption for consideration to be a transaction subject to transfer pricing documentation requirements, despite similar arguments from the taxpayer.<br><br>The author concluded by noting that taxpayers have two primary paths: either not preparing the documentation based on the older interpretation or preparing it based on the newer one, as a third alternative was not identified. The final decision, with advice and experience offered, was left to the taxpayer.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_781" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_781" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_781" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_782" style="display:none;">Despite numerous commercial agreements, clients often face issues like unfinished projects, staff shortages, and unforeseen events. Taxpayers are legally obligated to make mandatory monetary payments without prompting from the tax office. If a company's financial analysis suggests it cannot fulfill this obligation, the tax authority, under Article 67a of the Tax Ordinance, can postpone tax payment deadlines or allow payment in installments. They can also postpone or spread the payment of tax arrears with interest or even completely or partially forgive tax arrears, late payment interest, or extension fees upon the taxpayer's request, provided it doesn't constitute public aid or is de minimis aid.<br><br>Public aid can be granted to repair damage from natural disasters or other extraordinary events, prevent economic disturbances, support national entrepreneurs in European initiatives, and promote culture, heritage, science, and education. Crucially, if a business knows before the tax payment deadline that it lacks funds, it can request payment in installments without waiting for arrears. The taxpayer must provide arguments demonstrating a significant public or private interest justifying the relief and demonstrate the ability to meet the revised payment schedule. The tax authority then issues a decision deferring payment or allowing installments, including an extension fee. Compliance with the agreed payment schedule is crucial; failure to do so voids the decision, reverting to the original payment deadline. Although the required documentation and deadlines can be daunting, this approach offers a crucial lifeline for businesses.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_782" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_782" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_782" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_783" style="display:none;">In a court-ordered assessment for the District Court, I evaluated damages for the loss of a company's value due to an individual's wrongful arrest. The claimant held a 50% stake and was the CEO of a service-based limited liability company with established operations, equipment, and a good market reputation. The arrest lasted over a year, preventing the claimant from managing the company. Following his release, the company operated for another year but ultimately dissolved. This was due to the reputational damage from the CEO's arrest, leading to the inability to renew its lease. The claimant sought compensation for the company's asset value at the arrest's conclusion, the company's loss during the arrest period, and his unpaid salary.<br><br>My analysis involved reviewing financial statements, which, despite the company's size, accurately reflected its economic substance. I noted an increase in the company's assets and equity after the arrest, juxtaposed with fluctuating profit/loss figures. Specifically, the company transitioned from a small profit before the arrest to a significant profit the first year, followed by a substantial loss during the remaining arrest period. The claimant's compensation request included this loss.<br><br>However, the accounting figures didn't fully explain the equity increase, later revealed to be from selling fixed assets during liquidation. Simply using net book value for damages would be inequitable, as it would negate compensation for lost income. Therefore, I proposed an alternative, income-based valuation. Using the company's profit from the year preceding liquidation as a baseline, and considering a four-year lease as indicative of potential income, I estimated future profits. My calculation added these projected profits to the net assets at the arrest's end, then subtracted the actual capital value before liquidation. The claimant's 50% share of this figure, exceeding PLN 500,000, was recommended, with a potential 50% margin of error due to estimation and the company's confidential nature. Practical challenges included simplifying financial reporting periods and addressing the residual value from asset sales. I also had to justify the income-based method over relying solely on asset values or single-period losses.<br><br>In summary, the claimant's wrongful arrest led to the forced liquidation of his company. Initial financial statements showed an increase in asset value post-arrest, largely due to selling off depreciated yet valuable assets. However, this accounting approach masked the true economic damage: the loss of future income. My valuation focused on projecting the company's earnings potential before the arrest, using a four-year period as a benchmark. This income-based assessment, adjusted for asset sales and unpaid salaries, revealed the actual loss to the claimant. The process encountered practical issues like aligning financial data with the arrest timeline and accounting for the profits derived from asset liquidation. The recommended compensation aimed to fairly represent the lost earning capacity, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in such estimations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_783" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_783" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_783" style="display:none;"></p>

If income is insufficient to utilize the full deduction, it can be carried forward to subsequent tax years for up to six years.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_790" style="display:none;">Salaries in Poland increased by 6.7% compared to 2017, with a 7.1% annual rise in the first quarter. Employment also grew by 3.7% year-on-year in March, reaching 6.2 million people. However, many Poles are surprised by these figures, as the official statistics often don't reflect their personal income. This discrepancy arises because GUS (Statistics Poland) reports gross salaries, not net ones, meaning nearly 3.5 thousand PLN after taxes for an average gross salary of 4.9 thousand PLN. Furthermore, GUS primarily focuses on the enterprise sector, which typically pays better, and calculations for the "national average" are based on large and medium-sized firms, accounting for only about 38% of employees and including industry-specific bonuses and benefits.<br><br>The median salary, a more accurate representation of what half the workforce earns, was significantly lower. In October 2016, the median gross salary was 3,510.67 PLN, translating to just over 2.5 thousand PLN net. Even more revealing is the mode, the most frequently paid salary, which was a mere 2,074.03 PLN gross (1,511.61 PLN net) in October 2016, a stark contrast to the reported average. Statistics show that two-thirds of employees earn less than the national average. Regional variations and differences in pay between professions and genders also contribute to the overall salary landscape.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_790" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_790" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_790" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_791" style="display:none;">A self-employed individual was reclassified as a full-time employee after applying for maternity benefits a year into her work. This Supreme Court ruling (Case No. II UK 711/16) could set a precedent for individuals consistently working for a single company, operating under the client's imposed location and hours. Such individuals may be deemed permanent employees, and upon claiming benefits from their self-employment to ZUS (Social Insurance Institution), ZUS controllers may investigate and reclassify their status.<br><br>For employers, this reclassification means they could be liable for paying backdated employee contributions for up to five years. They must also meticulously account for the individual's working hours, ensuring compliance with overtime regulations. The employee, in turn, gains the right to claim any untaken paid leave for up to three years prior.<br><br>The case involved a woman working in a shop for a year before becoming pregnant and applying for benefits. ZUS controllers denied her claim, arguing her business registration was merely a facade. They noted she had deregistered from voluntary health insurance shortly before a prolonged sick leave, only to re-register with a higher contribution rate afterward. This was deemed a strategic move to secure a higher maternity allowance than her modest salary would warrant. Courts upheld ZUS’s decision, concluding she never intended to genuinely operate her business and primarily served the shop owner, working at their specified times and locations, not her registered business address.<br><br>The self-employed individual argued that many professions are now performed through self-employment, with legislative support, citing healthcare professionals as an example. However, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, ruling that a self-employed person loses that status when the client assumes responsibility for their work’s outcome and exercises control over their work's execution, location, and timing.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_791" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_791" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_791" style="display:none;"></p>

These reports must be signed using a qualified electronic signature or ePUAP trusted profile. The Ministry of Finance will define the logical structure and file format, likely integrated into the existing JPK (Standard Audit File) system. This digitalization aims to provide comprehensive insight into companies' financial health and enable cross-checking of information against other JPK structures.<br><br>Key changes for financial statements submitted for 2018 include:<br>- Taxpayers of PIT and CIT who maintain accounting records must prepare individual and consolidated financial statements electronically, excluding consolidated statements prepared according to IFRS.<br>- Businesses not registered in the National Court Register (KRS) will submit their reports directly to the Head of the National Revenue Administration (KAS).<br>- The KRS will maintain a financial document repository for all entities required to submit financial documents to it.<br>- Financial statements from this repository will be transferred to the Central Tax Data Register managed by the Head of KAS.<br><br>Furthermore, an amendment to the Tax Ordinance allows tax authorities to request explanations for non-submission or to summon entities to submit reports. Failure to comply can result in repeated fines of PLN 2800. These provisions for electronic financial reporting take effect on October 1, 2018, applying to statements for the 2018 fiscal year.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_793" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_793" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_793" style="display:none;"></p>

This extension, of approximately six months, applies to transactions from 2017 and 2018. The change is a response to taxpayer difficulties in meeting original deadlines.<br><br>The proposed regulation shifts the deadline for preparing documentation, submitting declarations, and attaching simplified reports to the last day of the ninth month after the end of the tax year, instead of the tax return filing date. This adjustment is intended to cover obligations arising from 2018 (for 2017 documentation) and 2019 (for 2018 documentation).<br><br>Concurrently, the Ministry of Finance is developing a legislative amendment aimed at significantly reducing and simplifying transfer pricing documentation obligations for taxpayers. These new rules, effective since 2017, introduced substantial reporting requirements, leading to significant workload and cost for businesses.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_797" style="display:none;">The Polish Ministry of Finance is finalizing a checklist for due diligence in domestic transactions, a process that has been ongoing for over six months. Deputy Finance Minister Paweł Gruza announced the nearing completion of this list, explaining that parliamentary work had caused delays. The checklist aims to protect taxpayers who diligently follow its guidelines, though the Ministry acknowledges that such checklists cannot be perfectly precise or exhaustive.<br><br>The Ministry conducted consultations on the due diligence checklist from June 30 to July 28, 2017, receiving 65 opinions from individuals, companies, business organizations, and local government units. A second stage of consultations on VAT due diligence criteria took place on September 13, 2017, also chaired by Deputy Minister Gruza.<br><br>These guarantees are being introduced due to the increasing use of VAT mechanisms for illegal gains across the EU, primarily through fraudulent refund claims or failure to remit VAT payments. A common tactic involves "missing traders" who evade taxes while creating grounds for others to claim refunds. This fraudulent activity, often involving multiple entities across EU states, harms honest businesses by distorting competition and directly depletes state budgets. Even honest but careless entrepreneurs can inadvertently become involved, risking the disallowance of their input tax credits. Therefore, these new measures, developed through compromise between the Ministry of Finance and businesses, aim to provide crucial protections for taxpayers.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_797" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_797" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_797" style="display:none;"></p>

Moore Czech Republic welcomes the strengthening of the private equity sector within its global Moore Global network, appointing a dedicated global leader in response to the growing importance of private equity on the Czech market.<br><br>Private equity is a dynamic economic segment, serving as an alternative financing source and an active partner for companies during crucial transformation phases. In the Czech Republic, it's becoming a vital tool for restructuring, generational change, and growth in SMEs. Private equity investors not only provide capital but also offer active management support, often acting as mentors.<br><br>While foreign private equity focuses on large acquisitions, the Czech market primarily targets SMEs. Czech private equity investors focus on smaller and medium-sized companies, often addressing generational ownership transitions. Their role is evolving from purely financial investors to strategic partners, aiding growth, efficiency, and the creation of value-added groups.<br><br>Modern private equity investors prioritize long-term value creation through process optimization, innovation, and management motivation, significantly impacting company performance. They achieve this by leveraging synergies between acquired companies and building integrated financial-industrial groups, moving beyond basic leverage, asset sales, or cost-cutting. This shift brings new quality for original owners, who often remain as minority shareholders.<br><br>Moore Advisory CZ, part of Moore Czech Republic, provides comprehensive support throughout the investment cycle, from investor identification to post-transaction integration, leveraging relationships with Czech private equity funds to select suitable partners. The firm's success as an exclusive advisor to the MaeG Investment SICAV fund, demonstrating high returns, validates its expertise. The appointment of Candice Czeremuskin as global leader for private equity within Moore Global highlights the sector's growing significance, forming a strong team to identify opportunities for knowledge sharing and innovation, ultimately enhancing client services.

Spektrum Secondary School Confirms Quality with Matriculation Results<br><br>June 30, 2025<br><br>While most students prepare for their matriculation exams in traditional classrooms, graduating students from Spektrum Secondary School successfully completed their maturity exams entirely without face-to-face instruction. The results once again confirm that online education is not a compromise but a fully-fledged and successful path to secondary education.<br><br>Spektrum Digital Secondary School, based in Mladá Boleslav, offers purely online study for students across the Czech Republic. This year's graduating class achieved notable success in their May 2025 written and oral matriculation exams in Czech language, foreign languages, and vocational subjects. In the state-administered part of the exams, students from the Business Academy program ranked 20th out of 103 schools in the Central Bohemian Region for Czech language and 11th out of 101 schools for English.<br><br>Extension programs in Entrepreneurship and Social Work also saw excellent results, with students achieving 100% success in German and being the only students in the region to matriculate in Russian. This reinforces a long-term trend: the quality of online teaching at Spektrum Secondary School matches, and in some aspects surpasses, traditional in-person education.<br><br>Ilona Pilařová, the school's director, expressed immense pride in the students' achievements, highlighting how many balance their studies with demanding jobs, top-tier sports, or childcare. Their success despite the lack of daily school attendance demonstrates that motivation and support enable students to overcome challenges.<br><br>Spektrum Secondary School has exclusively offered online learning since 2015, long before the pandemic made digital education common. Its flexible system allows students to tailor their learning pace to their schedules. Online classes are held three times a week, supplemented by independent study with teacher and tutor support. Students only attend school for exams once per semester. Pilařová emphasizes the school's individual approach, working with each student's unique story and motivations.<br><br>This model is ideal for working adults, parents on maternity leave, professional athletes, individuals with disabilities, and anyone seeking an alternative to conventional schooling. The emphasis on flexibility and individual attention aligns with the EU's Digital Education Action Plan 2021–2027, which promotes personalized, inclusive, and accessible learning. European institutions increasingly advocate for hybrid and distance learning models as legitimate educational components, placing Spektrum Secondary School several years ahead.<br><br>The school is also introducing a modular learning system in September, offering students greater choice and a more university-like experience. Plans are underway to open new branches across the country to facilitate easier access for examinations. Radovan Hauk, a partner in the Moore Czech Republic group, which owns Spektrum Secondary School, stated that the school aims to be a school for life, adapting to modern realities while providing a strong foundation for the future, with student matriculation results proving the viability of uncompromising online education.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_799" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_799" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_799" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_800" style="display:none;">The modern accounting profession is undergoing a dramatic transformation driven by artificial intelligence, digitalization, and a generational shift. Routine tasks are increasingly being automated by sophisticated systems, shifting the accountant's role towards data analysis, strategic, and tax advisory. This evolution is happening alongside a consolidation in the accounting outsourcing market as older firms transition and younger generations enter the field, often lacking practical experience.<br><br>Despite modernization, the profession faces declining interest, attributed to the complexity of tax and accounting systems, frequent legislative changes, and the need for continuous professional development. Simplifying legislation and reducing bureaucracy are seen as potential solutions. Technology implementation, such as specialized software for document digitization and workflow management, is becoming crucial for firms to maintain efficiency and serve diverse client needs. Remote work, electronic data exchange, and online portals are now standard, enhancing collaboration between clients and accounting firms.<br><br>Companies are increasingly outsourcing accounting due to hidden costs and risks associated with in-house departments. Outsourcing offers flexibility, scalability, and access to up-to-date legal knowledge, ensuring continuity and minimizing errors. While AI handles routine tasks, human expertise remains vital for interpreting complex transactions, advising clients, and navigating intricate situations.

While Europe aims to combat climate change and energy dependence through clean energy, the Czech Republic struggles with structural and regulatory hurdles. Massive investments, inadequate infrastructure, and a pricing structure unsuited for decentralized renewable production pose challenges.<br><br>Despite the Czech Republic's commitment to the EU's Fit for 55 plan, achieving the ambitious 2030 decarbonization and renewable energy targets is unlikely. Emissions are projected to decrease by around 45%, with renewables reaching approximately 25% of final energy consumption, falling short of the EU's goals.<br><br>While the Czech Republic has reduced reliance on solid fossil fuels, shifting towards renewables and nuclear energy, coal still constitutes a significant portion of its electricity generation compared to the EU average. Photovoltaics are experiencing a boom, but the lack of advanced storage infrastructure strains grid stability. Diversifying energy production technologies and infrastructure for energy storage is crucial.<br><br>The Czech Republic has potential in combined solar and wind energy due to complementary seasonal production. However, an undersized distribution network restricts new source connections, and unfavorable energy-sharing legislation with higher distribution fees discourages local consumption and community energy initiatives. The current electricity pricing structure, designed for centralized production, needs a review to accommodate thousands of small producers and reflect the variability of new sources.<br><br>Globally, geopolitical events have catalyzed a focus on energy independence, driving investments in decentralized renewable solutions.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_805" style="display:none;">Companies will face further tax changes in 2025, with the construction industry not being an exception.<br><br>The start of 2025 brought several tax changes impacting businesses in the Czech Republic, including amendments to VAT law and a restriction of tax security from financial guarantees to bank guarantees. Further key tax changes are set to take effect throughout the year, significantly affecting the construction sector and the real estate market.<br><br>From January 1, 2025, VAT law was modified concerning mandatory registration. If a business's annual turnover exceeds two million CZK but not 2,536,500 CZK, they become VAT payers from January 1 of the following year, based on the full calendar year's turnover, not any consecutive 12 months. Exceeding 2,536,500 CZK during the year makes them a VAT payer from the next day. This may cause confusion and administrative complications, with the actual impact yet to be seen.<br><br>Another administrative change is the narrowing of tax security forms from financial guarantees to only bank guarantees, aimed at preventing tax evasion. Businesses will need to switch to bank guarantees, potentially increasing administrative costs.<br><br>A new rule effective May 1, 2025, will affect financial institutions by changing how savings periods are calculated when switching long-term investment product providers. This aims to offer investors more flexibility and encourage competition, but requires financial institutions to thoroughly inform clients and adapt their systems.<br><br>The construction industry and real estate market will see significant tax changes from July. Property sales will be taxed only on the first sale within two years of occupancy or significant alteration; subsequent sales will be tax-exempt. VAT rates for construction and assembly work on completed residential or social housing will change if the construction no longer meets the criteria for these types, ensuring new construction isn't disadvantaged compared to reconstructed buildings not qualifying for reduced VAT. The definition of a residential building for social housing will also be updated, expanding the application of reduced VAT rates for residential building construction.<br><br>These changes may significantly influence real estate investors and developer strategies. Increased VAT on renovations and conversions could shift investor decisions towards new construction. The construction sector has already faced changes at the year's start, including new taxation rules for forest land and adjusted tax calculations. Municipalities can also now modify tax coefficients by property type or location, potentially increasing business tax liabilities.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_805" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_805" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_805" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_806" style="display:none;">The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally reshaped the labor market, transforming home-office work from a niche practice into a significant aspect of employment. Before the pandemic, Czech Republic had a low adoption rate of remote work, with only 10% of employees working from home at least occasionally, compared to the EU average of 16%. This dramatically shifted during the pandemic, leading to a sustained increase in remote work.<br><br>Experts indicate that this trend is largely characterized by hybrid models, where employees work from home for less than half of the week. The most significant increase is seen in the 25-44 age group, with a substantial rise in remote work adoption. Preferences show that a majority of both men and women wish to work from home a few days a week. Company size is less influential than the industry; sectors like information technology, finance, real estate, and insurance have seen the highest adoption of home-office arrangements. Studies suggest that hybrid work often boosts productivity, with 77% of managers reporting increased support for remote work post-pandemic.<br><br>The advantages of home-office include flexibility, better work-life balance, and potentially less office-related distraction. However, challenges like isolation, communication difficulties, and blurred work-life boundaries exist. Long-term productivity can decline without clear structure and employee discipline. Successful implementation requires clear communication of expectations, effective performance measurement, and employee motivation.<br><br>The rise of home-office also presents opportunities for greater female labor force participation, particularly for mothers of young children, and for attracting talent from further distances. For the future, while many employees desire continued remote work options, companies must strategically assess its suitability for their specific work and ensure it doesn't hinder efficiency. Clear communication, defined expectations, and provision of necessary tools and support are crucial for successful hybrid models. The overall approach to home-office will likely vary among employers, with some mandating office returns while others embrace more flexible arrangements, but a structured approach to measuring results is key.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_806" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_806" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_806" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_807" style="display:none;">The engineering group ANACOT CAPITAL, led by businessman Pavel Drobil, has acquired an 85% stake in Laugo Arms Czechoslovakia, a manufacturer of high-end sports and defense pistols. The transaction, completed in December 2024, also involved the MaeG Investment SICAV fund, managed by Moore Czech Republic. J&T Banka financed the deal. Laugo Arms is renowned for its innovative design and precision engineering, particularly its flagship Alien pistol, which features a revolutionary gas-operated bolt braking system and a low barrel position, making it ideal for sport shooting. The pistol has achieved international commercial success, winning awards like the main prize at the SHOT Show in Las Vegas.<br><br>Laugo Arms has significant growth potential and international expansion ambitions that require substantial investment. The new ownership is committed to driving the company forward through capital investment and leveraging their existing manufacturing capabilities and international network. Pavel Drobil highlighted the potential for market growth and new development opportunities in collaboration with the former owner. Petr Kymlička of MaeG Investment SICAV emphasized utilizing shared manufacturing capacities and extensive business contacts for distribution and partnerships. The new owners also plan to introduce an enhanced version of the Alien pistol. Laugo Arms currently sells approximately 3,500 hand-produced Alien pistols annually, with over 40% of its revenue generated in the USA. The company, established in 2017, reported €8.2 million in revenue and €2.3 million in EBITDA in 2022, with revenues expected to exceed €12 million in the following year. ANACOT CAPITAL focuses on acquiring and developing export-oriented industrial companies, with Pavel Drobil as its sole shareholder. In 2023, the group achieved a turnover of CZK 1.9 billion and an operating profit of CZK 86 million. MaeG Investment SICAV invests in medium-sized companies within traditional industrial sectors with growth potential.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_807" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_807" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_807" style="display:none;"></p>

They aim to inspire and share experiences with other companies to foster positive change. The charter's framework emphasizes openness, respect, communication, and considerate delegation, all crucial for combating stress-related issues like fatigue and burnout. Moore Czech Republic actively organizes workshops, like "How to Stay Effective and Not Go Crazy," offering practical stress-management tips. They also engage in initiatives like the "Moore to the Moon" challenge, encouraging physical activity, and local "WALKING CHALLENGE 10K" events, linking employee health with charitable contributions.

While 8.3% of Czechs aged 25-74 participated in retraining in the four months before data collection, the EU average is 12.7%. The analysis highlights that higher education and specialization are vital for shifting the Czech economy from assembly to innovation.<br><br>In the first half of this year, 20,118 people enrolled in retraining, a 39% increase year-on-year.

Employers should consider their needs, as flexibility and support for learning new technologies are key motivators for this demographic.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_811" style="display:none;">ESG reporting is subject to new rules, with the CSRD directive setting the standard from the new year. The European CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) introduces strict new regulations for non-financial reporting, fundamentally changing how companies report their sustainability activities. This regulation mandates standardized ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) data reporting, requiring companies to provide credible and transparent information on their environmental, social, and governance impact. The goal is to create consistent, comparable reports for investors and stakeholders to better understand and evaluate corporate sustainability.<br><br>Preparing for these stricter ESG reporting requirements under CSRD is crucial. Gone are the days of loosely defined ESG reports; sustainability reports will now have clear rules and undergo mandatory audits. Inconsistent or non-transparent data can lead to reputational and legal issues. Companies must conduct a mandatory double materiality analysis, assessing both the company's impact on the external environment and society (external materiality) and how external factors influence the company (internal materiality), identifying risks and opportunities according to ESRS standards.<br><br>The CSRD aims to standardize ESG reports and prevent greenwashing, ensuring transparency backed by data. Integrating ESG into corporate strategy and fostering cross-departmental collaboration are key for long-term success. Beyond compliance, companies should strive to be sustainability leaders to gain competitive advantages, not just meet legal obligations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_811" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_811" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_811" style="display:none;"></p>

Currently, only a quarter of organizations have a comprehensive implementation plan, with many lacking any roadmap at all. Key barriers to implementation include a lack of funds and expertise, as well as the complexity of legislative requirements. While those aware of NIS2 perceive it positively as an opportunity to enhance customer trust and security, many essential measures like incident response plans are still uncommon.<br><br>NIS2 aims to strengthen the security of networks and information systems, requiring regulated service providers to report to the National Cyber and Information Security Agency, implement security measures, and report cyber incidents. Many companies have already adopted some basic security practices like employee training and data backups, but more advanced measures are less widespread. The directive introduces significant regulatory changes for a broad range of private and public entities.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_813" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_813" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_813" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_814" style="display:none;">Companies are entering a new era of mandatory ESG reporting due to the CSRD directive. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is significantly expanding ESG reporting obligations for European firms, requiring mandatory reporting of non-financial activities. This directive builds upon the previous NFRD but covers a much wider scope.<br><br>CSRD applies to all large EU companies meeting at least two of three criteria: over 250 employees, annual turnover exceeding €50 million, or assets over €25 million. This will impact an estimated 250 companies in the Czech Republic, and over 50,000 across Europe by 2026. Companies already under NFRD must report for fiscal year 2024, while other large companies will start reporting for fiscal year 2025. Listed SMEs will be required to report from 2026, with a potential two-year voluntary deferral.<br><br>Key requirements include reporting according to unified European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) for consistency and comparability, and independent verification of ESG data to enhance credibility. The directive also emphasizes "double materiality," meaning companies must consider both their impact on the environment and society, and how external factors affect their business.<br><br>Implementing ESG is becoming crucial for strategic management, offering benefits such as reduced risk, better capital access, and increased trust from investors, customers, and employees. It enhances reputation and attractiveness in the market, as investors increasingly prioritize transparent and sustainable strategies, driven by concerns like climate change. This directive marks a new era where ESG is integral to long-term business success.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_814" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_814" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_814" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_815" style="display:none;">Amendments to the VAT Law: Promises of simplification are accompanied by concerns about excessive paperwork<br><br>The Chamber of Deputies is returning to the discussion of amendments to the Value Added Tax Act after the recess. This is a comprehensive revision from the Ministry of Finance that introduces numerous changes, both major and minor, into current legislation. Key changes relate to turnover parameters determining VAT registration obligation, the deductibility of input tax, and new provisions in construction. While the amendment promises to simplify existing procedures, it will also increase the administrative burden, particularly for small businesses. Larger companies, however, will not be significantly affected in this regard.<br><br>Lawmakers have discussed the amendment in its first reading. The Budget Committee of the Chamber will now take over. If the amendment passes through the legislative process, it is expected to become effective from January 1, 2025. From that date, the calculation of a company's turnover for mandatory VAT registration will be adjusted. The two-million-crown limit remains, but instead of the twelve preceding consecutive calendar months, turnover will be determined annually. If a business exceeds two million crowns in turnover during a given year, they will become a VAT payer from the beginning of the following year.<br><br>However, a different situation arises if the turnover exceeds 2,536,500 crowns, which is equivalent to the EU threshold of 100,000 euros. In this case, entities become VAT payers the next day.<br><br>One significant change is that if a customer fails to pay a supplier within six months of the due date, they will have to repay the deducted input tax. This raises concerns about administrative complexity in monitoring and complying with this rule, especially for small businesses and companies that settle mutual receivables and payables collectively, for instance, through offsetting.<br><br>The amended VAT Act also extensively addresses the construction sector. It shortens the period for taxing the first transfer of real estate from five years to two years (or 23 months) from completion or substantial alteration. New definitions for substantial alteration, social housing, and building plots are also introduced, clarifying when land delivery may be VAT-exempt based on official documentation.<br><br>While these changes might positively impact new construction prices, other factors influencing real estate costs must be considered. The text highlights Czech Republic's poor housing affordability compared to other EU countries and the length of construction procedures, suggesting that the amendments may not bring significant improvements in these areas.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>A proposed amendment to the Czech Value Added Tax (VAT) Act, set to take effect January 1, 2025, aims to simplify VAT registration and procedures. A key change alters the turnover threshold for mandatory VAT registration from a 12-month rolling period to an annual basis. Businesses exceeding two million Czech crowns in turnover within a calendar year will become VAT payers from the following year. However, exceeding a slightly higher EU threshold of 2,536,500 crowns (approx. €100,000) will trigger immediate VAT payer status the next day, potentially creating administrative complications.<br><br>Another significant change requires businesses to repay deducted input tax if a customer's payment is overdue by more than six months after its due date, raising concerns about increased administrative burden for monitoring these obligations, particularly for small businesses and those using netting arrangements. The amendment also revises rules for the construction sector, shortening the period for taxing the first property transfer and introducing new definitions for significant property alterations, social housing, and building plots. While some changes might influence property prices, experts express skepticism about their ability to significantly improve housing affordability or speed up construction procedures in the Czech Republic.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_815" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_815" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_815" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_816" style="display:none;">Changes in DPP and DPČ may negatively impact employment flexibility in the Czech Republic.<br><br>Effective July 1, 2024, new regulations mandate that employers must report all "agreements to complete work" (DPP) to the Czech Social Security Administration (ČSSZ) monthly. This applies to all DPPs, including those below the CZK 10,000 threshold not subject to insurance contributions. Employers must submit a report by the 20th of the following month, detailing employee start and end dates and income. While the core DPP framework remains unchanged, this new reporting requirement significantly increases administrative burdens and costs for businesses.<br><br>Experts warn that this added bureaucracy could make employers less willing to utilize DPPs for short-term tasks, potentially hindering their ability to respond to market demands and reducing overall labor market flexibility. Companies may shift towards full-time employment or outsourcing to OSVČ. The government's aim is greater transparency and improved employee conditions, but the practical implementation raises concerns.<br><br>The article also highlights the need for greater flexibility in the Czech labor market, citing lower rates of part-time employment and lower maternal employment compared to the EU average. Remote work and flexible working hours are also discussed as ways to enhance flexibility, particularly for older workers and mothers. Investing in lifelong learning and reskilling is crucial to help the workforce adapt to technological advancements and a dynamic job market.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_816" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_816" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_816" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_817" style="display:none;">Sustainability is becoming paramount for energy companies from an investor perspective. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is gaining momentum, making sustainability a top priority. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing companies' sustainability efforts and incorporating them into their investment decisions, pushing businesses to adopt new technologies and accelerate their shift to renewables.<br><br>This trend was amplified after global leaders at COP28 in Dubai unexpectedly supported the transition to clean energy. Fifty major oil and gas companies pledged to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 in energy production and utilization.<br><br>Petr Nakládal, Senior Manager of Energy Portfolio Management at Moore Czech Republic, highlights that this communiqué marks the first agreement on a phase-out of coal, oil, and gas in nearly three decades of negotiations. He emphasizes that while sustainability is embedded in boardrooms, investor pressure for transparency in ESG reporting, regular audits, and clear strategies for increasing sustainable energy use is growing.<br><br>Energy companies are consequently investing heavily in technologies and practices that enhance operational energy efficiency, including advanced monitoring systems, energy-efficient equipment, and processes that minimize energy consumption. They are also replacing older infrastructure with more efficient and environmentally friendly solutions, such as using solar energy to produce steam for enhanced oil recovery. AI is proving valuable in analyzing and implementing these technologies, though achieving sustainability goals remains challenging due to the need for further technological development and implementation.<br><br>The Czech government also recognizes the importance of energy transformation, approving a significant amendment to the energy act (Lex OZE II). This legislation facilitates the formation of energy communities, allowing public sector entities, households, and businesses to share electricity. Tomáš Křapáček, Senior Manager at Moore Advisory CZ, notes that rising energy prices underscore the need for strategic energy solutions, boosting the communal energy trend. The first step involves developing local energy concepts, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade is financially supporting to help municipalities identify inefficiencies and implement conceptual solutions. This decentralization through community energy will enable efficient local consumption of electricity near its point of generation. Municipalities can apply for this funding until June 30, 2025, or until the allocated funds are depleted.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_817" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_817" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_817" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_818" style="display:none;">Despite significant property price growth, the Czech Republic is not facing a real estate bubble. Property prices in the Czech Republic have risen considerably in recent years, particularly in and around major cities. This surge is attributed to a confluence of factors including a shortage of new apartments, lower mortgage interest rates, and increasing demand from both investors and homebuyers. Eurostat data confirms this trend, showing a 126% increase in property prices between 2010 and 2022, far exceeding the EU average of 47%. Rental prices have also climbed, though less dramatically.<br><br>While the situation is challenging, experts like Bedřich Skalický from Moore Advisory CZ and Tomáš Odstrčil from Evropa v datech argue against an impending market collapse. They note that banks are more cautious with lending, mortgage regulations have tightened, and individuals are more financially aware. This is leading to a cooling market rather than a crash. However, affordability remains a significant issue, with Czechs needing 14.9 years of salary to buy a new apartment, double the rate in some Western European countries.<br><br>Skalický advises potential homebuyers not to postpone purchases based on speculative market predictions, emphasizing that buying property is a long-term decision tied to current needs and capabilities. The high demand from both owner-occupiers and investors, coupled with a persistent undersupply of new properties and lengthy building permit processes, continues to drive prices up in desirable locations. This imbalance suggests that while prices might stagnate or slightly decrease in the short term, a drastic market fall is unlikely, with stability and resilience underpinning the market.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_818" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_818" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_818" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_819" style="display:none;">Economic analysis by Moore Czech Republic confirms the profitability of the Ještěd cable car investment.<br><br>A single-cabin cable car, favored by Liberec residents, councilors, and representatives, will require a higher initial investment but is the most economically advantageous long-term option. This conclusion comes from the study "Business Plan for the Restoration and Operation of the Horní Hanychov – Ještěd Cable Car," prepared by Moore Czech Republic for the statutory city of Liberec. The study's objective was to create an economic model and evaluate financial parameters for the project.<br><br>The recommended option is a two-rope system with a single cabin on an extended route from Horní Hanychov to Ještěd. The total investment, including the cable car, construction, land acquisition, and related costs, is estimated at up to 750 million Czech Koruna, with a projected payback period of 15.5 years. Demolition and construction are slated to begin at the end of 2026, with the new cable car expected to open in January 2029. The average fare is calculated at 326 CZK, with significant discounts planned for Liberec residents.<br><br>The extended route, despite higher initial costs, is deemed more beneficial due to direct connections to public transport and central parking, ensuring greater utilization. The accessible and barrier-free design is expected to attract more passengers. The chosen Funifor technology, often referred to as a "tram," offers lower investment and operating costs, can function in adverse weather, and allows for an intermediate station. This intermediate station would serve skiers in winter, further boosting the cable car's tourism potential.<br><br>City representatives finalized the cable car's design in late April, aligning with the council's earlier vote and the results of a public poll involving 1668 respondents. Over 58% of respondents favored the two-rope cabin, dubbed the "tram," indicating public and expert consensus. Out of six considered variants, including those on the existing 1.2 km route and the extended 1.97 km route to Horní Hanychov, the "tram" variant with a single cabin for 80-100 people on two ropes was selected. The cable car has been out of service since a tragic accident in October 2021 and is being purchased from Czech Railways by the city for 34.976 million CZK.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_819" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_819" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_819" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_820" style="display:none;">The hospitality sector is experiencing a year of growth and digital transformation, moving beyond pandemic impacts with many hotel groups achieving record occupancy and profitability. This year focuses on technological innovation, particularly advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, shifting from basic chatbots to sophisticated solutions for revenue management, security, and energy control. The global hospitality AI market is projected to reach $8.12 billion by 2033.<br><br>The trend of "bleisure" (business + leisure) travel is growing, with global business travel spending expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2024, contributing to longer stays and increased spending. Investor interest in hotels remains strong due to their dynamic pricing and occupancy trends, distinguishing them from other commercial properties. Major hotel chains are pursuing expansion in emerging regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and popular European destinations.<br><br>However, the sector faces challenges including geopolitical risks, economic slowdowns, rising operational costs, and a persistent shortage of skilled labor. In the Czech Republic, while the sector saw a rebound in 2023, with over 22 million tourists, the primary issue remains the short duration of tourist stays. This is partly due to a shift towards visitors from neighboring countries and a lack of long-stay tourists from regions like Asia. Prague, in particular, is affected by limited intercontinental air connectivity. Adapting to digitalization, sustainability, personalized services, and effective state promotion are crucial for the Czech hospitality industry to attract longer-staying international visitors.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_820" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_820" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_820" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_821" style="display:none;">Despite labor shortages, Czechs over 55 believe age is a barrier to finding work. A survey by MOORE Czech Republic reveals that 85.2% of Czechs over 55 feel age is a major obstacle to employment, with nearly half strongly agreeing. Both the 55-59 and 60-65 age groups share this sentiment. Marcela Hrdá from MOORE Czech Republic points out that while the Czech labor market is overheated, companies struggle to attract older workers, who often possess valuable skills, language abilities, and experience.<br><br>Hrdá warns that the low unemployment rate isn't necessarily positive for the Czech economy, hindering recovery and competitiveness. She urges companies to create part-time opportunities and support environments to retain employees over 55. The survey also shows that nearly 70% perceive employer concerns about older employees keeping up with technology, while 64% believe companies simply prefer younger workers. Over half believe that firms are prejudiced against the productivity and motivation of older workers.<br><br>Hrdá suggests that companies need to overcome these biases and undergo a mental transformation in their HR policies. Flexibility is a key factor for older employees, but nearly 60% perceive a lack of it from employers. Respondents suggested that employers would welcome flexible working hours, technology training, and health support. 46.5% think more awareness about the benefits of older workers would help, and nearly a third want more information about suitable job opportunities. Many older employees feel they could contribute more to their current employers. The survey was conducted by MOORE Czech Republic in April 2024 on a sample of 600 employed respondents over 55.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_821" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_821" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_821" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_822" style="display:none;">Automotive suppliers face complex investment decisions as major car manufacturers signal that electric vehicles (EVs) aren't the only future path. Stagnating EV sales prompt a more pragmatic approach, with traditional combustion engines and "e-fuels" retaining their role. While EV sales are expected to rise globally, growth varies across markets, with Europe expected to stagnate, US sales potentially hindered by political factors, and China's growth slowing. Toyota's chairman predicts EVs will never exceed 30% of global sales, favoring alternative fuels like hydrogen.<br><br>This uncertainty challenges suppliers, especially those in Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the supply chain. Tier 1 suppliers grapple with allocating R&D budgets across different powertrains, while Tier 2 suppliers, producing specialized components, face difficult transitions. Shifting from combustion engine parts to EV components demands time and investment, a challenge for smaller, often family-owned businesses reliant on internal funding and bank loans. The industry's low margins and pressure from manufacturers to lower costs further complicate matters.<br><br>This situation will likely lead to consolidation among traditional suppliers, attracting private investment and fostering collaboration within the supply chain. The uncertainty could also spur a new ecosystem with closer ties between manufacturers and suppliers, potentially enabling companies to manage both combustion engine and EV technologies. Czech suppliers also face these challenges, adapting to new trends while navigating labor shortages and cost pressures.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_822" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_822" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_822" style="display:none;"></p>

AI offers opportunities for optimized production and data-driven decision-making, but requires careful management of trust in digital technologies. The trend of manufacturing repatriation is also gaining momentum, driven by supply chain vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic and geopolitical instability. Companies are shifting away from "just-in-time" models towards more resilient industrial ecosystems.<br><br>AI's impact extends to predicting customer behavior, forecasting trends, and modeling strategic scenarios. However, realizing AI's benefits requires investment in employee skills and real-time data accessibility across departments. While AI simplifies key performance indicators and enhances decision-making through data visualization tools, managers must be cautious about blind trust, ensuring data accuracy and validation.<br><br>Implementing these technologies demands resources, time, and substantial investment, complicated by high borrowing costs and economic uncertainty. Efficient financial management is crucial, particularly for companies reliant on complex supply chains disrupted by recent global events. Geopolitical instability exacerbates these challenges, prompting a shift away from the traditional "just-in-time" model. Manufacturing repatriation is accelerating, with increased investment in domestic production in the US and Europe, supported by government incentives. Businesses are prioritizing proximity to consumers, driving new factory openings in these regions, which is enhancing countries' economic independence.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_823" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_823" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_823" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_825" style="display:none;">Community energy can transform the Czech Republic, with the state supporting cities and municipalities in their energy transition. The recent amendment to the Energy Act, Lex OZE II, paves the way for community energy development. A crucial initial step is creating a local energy concept, for which significant subsidies are available through the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) from the National Recovery Plan. Municipalities can apply online until June 30, 2025.<br><br>Developing a local energy concept helps municipalities understand their energy balance, identify inefficiencies, and target energy measures effectively. Tomáš Křapáček from Moore Advisory CZ emphasizes the need for strategic energy planning, advising municipalities to prioritize development activities based on return on investment. He cautions against solely focusing on solar panels, advocating for comprehensive energy solutions. Subsidies cover 85-95% of eligible costs.<br><br>These concepts allow detailed assessment, inventory of consumption points, and creation of a complete energy balance, encompassing municipal property, the business sector, and households. This fosters collaboration and is a stepping stone to community energy, enabling calculation of energy and economic impacts of shared energy flows. Lex OZE II facilitates energy sharing among public sector entities, households, and businesses. Decentralized energy, complementing centralized systems, allows efficient local consumption. Local energy concepts also propose energy solutions, estimate investments, and evaluate returns, enabling data-driven decisions and promoting renewable energy use.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_825" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_825" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_825" style="display:none;"></p>

However, according to research by Moore Czech Republic, only 44% of employees in these companies are aware of the obligation to establish internal reporting systems. While 70% of employees are willing to report illegal activities, 42% fear retaliation.<br><br>"The findings also indicate shortcomings in reporting methods and the need for better employee information and education. Education and building trust are crucial for the success of the law, which is a key element in the fight against corruption and in strengthening transparency in the Czech Republic," comments Petr Štětka, senior manager at the consulting group Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>The new whistleblower protection law, also known as the "whistleblower" law, came into effect on August 1st of this year. Whistleblowers are now expected to play a significant role in reporting illegal activities within organizations and companies. The legislative change initially affects businesses and other employers with more than 250 employees, municipalities with over 10,000 inhabitants, and public procurers with more than 50 employees.<br><br>"Companies with 50 to 249 employees have until December 15th by law to prepare an effective reporting system. Unfortunately, many of them seem not to be taking this opportunity seriously and are leaving implementation to the last minute," points out Petr Štětka.<br><br>Employees are in the dark. One of the main provisions of the law is the obligation for employers to implement an internal reporting system. Through this system, whistleblowers have the opportunity to report unfair practices, and the system is intended to ensure their protection. According to Moore Czech Republic's research, however, only 44% of employees in companies with over 250 employees are aware of the existence of internal reporting systems that are now mandatory.<br><br>"The whistleblower protection law represents a significant step towards strengthening transparency and corporate culture. However, the research showed that almost a quarter of employees are not aware of such a system at all, and a third are unable to answer the question. This highlights the need for better employee information and education in this area," says Petr Štětka.<br><br>Despite low awareness, employee willingness to report wrongdoing is surprisingly high, with nearly 70% ready to do so. However, 42% of employees fear potential negative consequences, indicating that corporate culture and awareness of legal protections are vital. Current reporting methods are also a concern, with personal reporting being the most common, potentially deterring whistleblowers due to anonymity and retaliation fears. More sophisticated methods like hotlines and apps are less frequently used.<br><br>The research clearly shows that while the whistleblower protection law is a step in the right direction, focusing on education and building employee trust is essential. Success depends not only on implementation but also on a shift in mindset. Creating an environment where employees feel safe to use reporting systems is crucial for the Czech Republic's efforts to increase transparency and combat unfair practices.<br><br>A survey conducted in late November 2023 among 530 employees in companies with over 250 staff revealed that only 44% are aware of mandatory internal reporting systems. Despite this, 70% of employees are willing to report illegal acts, though a significant 42% fear retaliation. The research also highlighted a lack of awareness regarding reporting methods, with personal reporting being the most common, followed by email and traditional written methods. More advanced channels like specialized helplines and apps are less prevalent.<br><br>The study emphasizes the critical need for better employee education on reporting systems and channels to foster a culture of transparency and trust. Companies that successfully implement these systems can mitigate reputational risks and prevent damaging situations.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_830" style="display:none;">A study by Moore Advisory CZ for the Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs highlights the need for improved fire safety in residential social care facilities like nursing homes. The analysis, comparing the Czech Republic to Germany, Austria, Poland, and New Zealand, found that foreign facilities emphasize more frequent fire safety training and evacuation drills for staff.<br><br>A survey of 153 Czech facilities revealed shortcomings. Of those providing services in multi-story buildings, nearly half lack evacuation-compliant elevators, posing a significant risk during a fire. While most facilities have multiple escape routes and fire detection systems, fewer have evacuation elevators or fire alarms connected to fire stations. Facilities with over 50 beds have until December 2024 to install electronic fire signaling systems. Worryingly, some reported having only one escape route.<br><br>The report indicates that financial constraints hinder fire safety improvements, as most facilities are publicly funded and lack investment budgets, further strained by rising energy costs. The analysis underscores the importance of proactive fire safety measures to prevent tragedies in these vulnerable settings.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_830" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_830" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_830" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_831" style="display:none;">Sustainability as a Key to Higher Revenue and Employee Retention<br><br>Recent years have seen a significant shift in how businesses view their role in the economy and society. A Moore Global survey indicates that companies embracing sustainability principles are experiencing higher revenues, improved customer retention, and enhanced brand image. Sustainability is no longer a trend but a core business strategy, often placed on par with profitability, as the two are increasingly interconnected.<br><br>The research reveals that 84% of companies acknowledge the growing importance of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) issues. Businesses prioritizing sustainability have seen a 10% revenue increase over the past four years, double that of less engaged firms. Customer retention improved by 79% in companies with increased ESG focus, compared to 47% for others. Similarly, brand image improved for 81% of businesses progressing in ESG, versus 49% for others. These findings translate into tangible economic results, with medium and large enterprises emphasizing sustainability reporting a $3.1 trillion revenue increase over four years.<br><br>"Sustainability is now not only a moral imperative but also a growth strategy," states Tomáš Buriánek, senior manager at Moore Czech Republic. "Companies applying sustainability principles achieve tangible results. Our research shows sustainability is a path to prosperity in the new global economy."<br><br>Furthermore, a proactive approach to ESG positively impacts customer loyalty. The IT sector leads with 92% of companies reporting increased customer retention, followed by accounting and finance (83%). Retail, wholesale, manufacturing, and distribution sectors reported 81% improvement, with automotive and aerospace at 75%. This indicates a positive shift in how consumers perceive companies committed to sustainability.<br><br>Sustainability also plays a crucial role in attracting and retaining talent. Companies with a clear commitment to social issues and equality are better positioned to attract employees who value a company's principles beyond salary. Businesses with increased ESG focus saw a 7% employee growth over four years, compared to only 2% for lagging companies, highlighting sustainability's impact on workforce development.<br><br>"Businesses actively and consistently addressing sustainability issues have a significant competitive advantage," comments Martin Buranský, partner at Moore Czech Republic. "Their ESG engagement translates into revenue growth, fosters more loyal customers, and strengthens brand image." This creates a positive feedback loop, where high ESG standards lead to increased customer loyalty, a stronger brand, and ultimately, long-term business success.<br><br>The research surveyed 1,800 decision-makers across 1,800 companies with over 250 employees in multiple countries. The findings strongly suggest that ESG is a pivotal factor for future business success in the current global economic landscape.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>A Moore Global survey reveals that companies prioritizing sustainability, or ESG principles, are outperforming their less engaged counterparts. These businesses report higher revenue growth (10% vs. 5%), significantly better customer retention (79% vs. 47%), and improved brand image (81% vs. 49%). The research indicates that for medium and large enterprises, a strong ESG focus has contributed to a $3.1 trillion increase in revenue over four years. Sustainability is no longer just an ethical consideration but a strategic driver of economic prosperity.<br><br>Beyond financial benefits, sustainability also aids in talent acquisition and retention. Companies demonstrating a commitment to social issues and equality attract more employees who seek value alignment. These firms experienced 7% employee growth compared to 2% for those lagging in ESG, underscoring sustainability's importance in building a strong workforce. The findings suggest that actively addressing ESG issues provides a significant competitive advantage, fostering customer loyalty and strengthening brand reputation, ultimately leading to sustained business success.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_831" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_831" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_831" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_832" style="display:none;">Eight out of ten parents would return to work sooner if their employer provided a company nursery or childcare group. This finding comes from research conducted by the consulting group Moore Czech Republic. In today's tight labor market with record low unemployment, companies struggle to retain talent. Company-provided childcare is identified as a key motivational tool.<br><br>Currently, less than 15% of parents with children aged 1-6 report their employer offers company childcare. This support is not yet standard in the Czech Republic, but employee interest is high, with over 60% of parents without access expressing a desire to use it. For nearly 14% of parents, company childcare is a crucial benefit, while 27% consider it important but not essential, and 47% find it an attractive benefit.<br><br>This childcare support helps parents return to work gradually, perhaps part-time initially, with their children nearby and in a safe environment. It reduces parental anxiety, isolation, and allows for better focus on work. For employers, it means faster reintegration of skilled employees, reduced turnover, and enhanced reputation as a family-friendly company, ultimately saving recruitment and training costs.<br><br>The availability of company childcare could also encourage shorter parental leave periods in the Czech Republic, which currently has the longest in the EU. This benefit is crucial for retaining and motivating key employees in a competitive market.<br><br>## Summary<br><br>A recent study by Moore Czech Republic reveals that eight out of ten parents would return to work earlier if their employer offered company-provided childcare. In a challenging labor market characterized by low unemployment, retaining skilled employees is a significant concern for businesses. Company nurseries and childcare groups are emerging as essential tools for employee motivation and retention.<br><br>Currently, a limited percentage of employers offer such benefits, but employee demand is substantial. Over 60% of parents without access to company childcare expressed interest in using it. For a significant portion of parents, this benefit is either crucial or highly desirable, indicating its strong appeal.<br><br>The provision of company childcare offers dual advantages: it facilitates a smoother and less anxious return to work for parents, allowing for gradual reintegration into the workforce while ensuring children are cared for nearby. For employers, it leads to the quicker re-engagement of experienced staff, reduced employee turnover, and a strengthened employer brand as a family-supportive organization. This, in turn, can lead to cost savings in recruitment and training. Furthermore, accessible company childcare could encourage a reduction in the lengthy parental leave periods common in the Czech Republic, positively impacting the overall labor market. Ultimately, offering such support is presented as a critical factor for company success in today's competitive environment.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_832" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_832" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_832" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_833" style="display:none;">First Observations on the Implementation of the Whistleblower Protection Act: Caught-Off-Guard Schools and Hesitant Small Businesses<br><br>The new Whistleblower Protection Act came into effect on August 1, 2023, introducing significant changes for various entities in the Czech Republic. Whistleblowers are now expected to play a crucial role in reporting illegal activities within organizations. Early observations suggest that the law has surprised many, including schools that had to implement new requirements during their summer break. Experts emphasize the necessity of building trust in the reporting system among employees and fostering a change in corporate culture.<br><br>The law mandates that employers with at least fifty employees, municipalities with over 10,000 inhabitants, public procurement entities, certain public authorities, and specific financial sector entities must establish an internal reporting system. However, companies with 50 to 249 employees have an extended deadline until December 15, 2023, for implementation. Failure to comply can result in penalties of up to one million Czech crowns for severe violations, such as not establishing a system or allowing retaliation against whistleblowers. False reporting can incur fines of up to 50,000 Czech crowns.<br><br>A key aspect of the law is the employer's obligation to operate an internal reporting system to protect whistleblowers. The credibility of this system hinges on the trustworthiness of the designated investigator, who must act independently and impartially, informing whistleblowers of the outcome within legal deadlines. Assigning this role to existing employees carries a risk of distrust, as employees might fear retaliation from colleagues.<br><br>For the system's success, it's crucial to move beyond mere formal compliance and cultivate a workplace atmosphere where employees feel safe to report. Top management's attitude and commitment are vital for genuine change towards greater transparency and fairness. While smaller companies have more time, they are urged to use it effectively for preparation, as many appear to be delaying implementation. Comprehensive solutions, including electronic tools, internal documentation, employee training, and ongoing support for the reporting process, are available to help organizations navigate these new requirements.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_833" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_833" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_833" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_835" style="display:none;">Unemployment is low, but the Czech economy is struggling. Why do we need foreigners and flexible working conditions?<br><br>August 21, 2023<br><br>Unemployment in the Czech Republic has been falling for several months, resulting in one of the lowest rates in the EU. However, this is not good news for the Czech economy, which is struggling. A situation where GDP is falling, unemployment is decreasing, and the number of job vacancies is rising hinders economic recovery and the competitiveness of Czech businesses. Radovan Hauk of Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the crucial need for the government to allow companies to hire skilled foreign workers, including Ukrainians, for long-term employment. Equally important is supporting part-time positions and creating an environment to retain employees over 55. Failure to address these issues will lead to significant future problems.<br><br>The demographic threat is substantial. The working population is declining due to an aging population, with around 40,000 fewer workers entering the market annually than those retiring. This deficit is projected to worsen in the next decade. The shortage of workers limits business growth and results in significant economic losses for the state. An estimated 280,000 to 300,000 vacancies represent a loss of approximately 350 to 375 billion CZK annually in GDP, and 95 to 105 billion CZK in potential tax revenue and social security contributions.<br><br>The tight labor market also drives excessive wage growth, though real wages have decreased due to high inflation. Certain sectors, like healthcare, IT, and manufacturing, face critical worker shortages. The government, in collaboration with social partners, must create more accessible and flexible programs for employing foreigners, focusing on attracting highly skilled individuals and also addressing the need for less-skilled labor in sectors where Czechs are less inclined to work. Competition from countries like Germany, with higher wages, makes attracting foreign talent even more challenging.<br><br>The Czech Republic's low unemployment rate, coupled with a struggling economy and a growing number of job vacancies, highlights a critical need for foreign labor and more flexible employment conditions. The aging Czech population means a declining workforce, with fewer young people entering the market than older workers retiring. This demographic trend is expected to exacerbate the labor shortage in the coming decade. Businesses are unable to reach their full production potential, leading to significant economic losses for the country, estimated at billions of CZK annually, in terms of lost GDP and tax revenue. The current wage growth, while seemingly high, is outpaced by inflation, leading to a real decrease in wages. Sectors such as healthcare, IT, and manufacturing are experiencing severe worker shortages. To maintain competitiveness and economic growth, the government must implement policies that facilitate the employment of foreign workers, both highly skilled and less-skilled. This includes reforming existing programs and actively attracting talent from abroad, especially competing with countries like Germany. Flexible working arrangements, such as part-time employment and retaining older workers, are also vital to addressing the labor deficit and ensuring the sustainability of the Czech economy.<br><br>Low unemployment is plaguing the Czech economy, which is struggling despite a declining jobless rate. This situation is exacerbated by a declining working-age population due to demographic shifts, with more people retiring than entering the workforce. Experts stress the urgent need for the government to facilitate the employment of foreign workers, both skilled and unskilled, to fill labor shortages and boost economic growth. The current economic landscape is characterized by businesses being unable to operate at full capacity due to a lack of staff, resulting in substantial economic losses for the country. Furthermore, real wages are falling due to high inflation. To counter these challenges and enhance competitiveness, the Czech Republic must adopt more flexible employment policies and attract foreign talent, facing competition from countries like Germany.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_835" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_835" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_835" style="display:none;"></p>

Jan Kubica, a partner at Moore Legal CZ, stated that AI is viewed as another tool for lawyers, supplementing existing resources like legal commentary and case law. While AI's current role focuses on more peripheral tasks such as summarizing time sheets or preparing marketing reports, it presents an opportunity for law firms to rethink their internal workflows.<br><br>However, experts urge caution regarding AI's potential risks in legal practice.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_837" style="display:none;">The Czech M&A market is recovering after a slowdown, with investors focusing on company resilience following the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Concerns about a deeper recession have eased, leading to renewed investor appetite fueled by accumulated capital and high inflation. Experts at Moore Czech Republic anticipate a market revival in the second half of 2023 and early 2024.<br><br>A crucial factor for investment is the resilience and sustainability of business models. Investors prioritize companies that have proven their ability to weather crises and those with diversified activities, avoiding those overly reliant on single areas.<br><br>The first half of 2023 saw 61 transactions, fewer than the previous year. However, receding recession fears are expected to increase transaction volume in the latter half of the year. Noteworthy deals include Westly Group's acquisition of Woltair, highlighting the attractiveness of clean energy companies, and Carlyle Group's acquisition of Meopta - Optika. The improved energy market situation has also allayed investor fears.<br><br>Currently, energy-intensive businesses, automotive suppliers, and firms dependent on foreign supply chains face challenges. While energy prices have stabilized, industries reliant on Asian supplies remain at risk. There's still significant investor interest in the energy sector. A key factor for investors is the sustainability and resilience of potential acquisition targets.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_837" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_837" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_837" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_838" style="display:none;">According to Moore Global, companies leveraging disruptive technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), will thrive in manufacturing and distribution. Global AI investments in this sector, roughly $50 billion in 2020, are projected to double by 2024. Czech firms face ongoing supply chain disruptions exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.<br><br>Approximately 20% of AI spending is allocated to process automation, with AI-powered machines increasingly replacing repetitive tasks. While manufacturing and distribution have successfully implemented AI, significant potential remains for further integration. Disruptive innovations like cloud technology, digitalization, robotics, the Internet of Things, AI, and augmented/virtual reality are reshaping the global economy.<br><br>A survey reveals that 44% of Czech companies invested 5-20% of their annual budget in digital investments last year, compared to 27% in 2019. Firms recognize digital investment as vital for competitiveness and resilience during crises. A shortage of skilled workers hinders effective digital technology implementation, necessitating employee training and improved education. Augmented and virtual reality are becoming increasingly important in digitizing industry, accelerating processes, enabling remote solutions, and enhancing training. Supply chain issues persist, impacting Czech firms reliant on Russian and Ukrainian markets, with resolution unlikely in the near future.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_838" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_838" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_838" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_839" style="display:none;">Three out of four Czech employees favor a four-day work week, according to a recent survey commissioned by Moore Czech Republic. Nearly half of Czech employees would definitely agree with implementing a four-day work week, and another 28% would likely agree. This interest is higher than it was two years ago, with 67% of respondents expressing a positive view compared to 61% in a previous survey. In both surveys, 65% of employees stated they would dedicate more time to their work if the work week was shortened.<br><br>Around 30% of respondents believe a four-day week would be sufficient to fulfill company obligations without increased productivity, while almost 22% think it would work if employee performance improved. Younger employees are more inclined towards a shorter work week, with about 83% of those aged 18-26 being positive, compared to under 65% for those over 36. Men are generally more skeptical than women.<br><br>Currently, experiments with four-day work weeks are underway across Europe. While the Czech Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs isn't planning a widespread implementation, companies are trying less radical adjustments like flexible work arrangements or home office. Experts believe that adopting a four-day work week could attract employees, especially in the current labor shortage.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_839" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_839" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_839" style="display:none;"></p>

For example, it can help in the recruitment process.<br><br>June 29, 2023<br><br>Dozens of percent of Czechs fear losing their jobs due to AI. Experts from the consulting group Moore Czech Republic are mitigating these concerns, predicting that the use of AI will lead to more efficient human work rather than its replacement. According to their estimates, AI will affect almost all industries, primarily administration and financial services. AI will also facilitate the recruitment process in companies. In practice, the recruitment team from Moore Advisory CZ also uses AI, which helps them fill lucrative job positions.<br><br>According to a survey by the Median agency, 31% of Czechs are worried about their jobs due to the rise of AI.<br><br>"AI will undoubtedly replace some job positions, but it will rather make work more efficient overall, and even create a number of new job positions. What is certain in any case is that the rise of AI will transform the structure of the labor market in the Czech Republic and affect almost all industries - initially, it will be administration or financial services," comments Miloslav Rut, partner at Moore Technology CZ, adding that the impact of AI will be felt earlier and more strongly in Western European countries and the USA than in the Czech Republic.<br><br>Twice the response thanks to AI<br><br>AI will also streamline the recruitment process in companies. This is how the Moore Advisory CZ recruitment team uses it.<br><br>"For example, we were filling a product marketing manager position for our client, a large IT company, and it occurred to us that artificial intelligence could help us with this. Thanks to ChatGTP, we created a job description and ultimately filled the position successfully," describes Lucie Krejčová, Recruitment Manager at Moore Advisory CZ. She further explains the use of AI in filling the position in numbers: "The average response rate to our messages on LinkedIn is between 35 and 45%. For this position, the response rate was significantly above average, as it was 70%. We were also able to choose from seven quality candidates, which is again above standard. For most other positions, we aim to offer two to three quality candidates."<br><br>AI seeks new employees<br><br>The scope for the application of AI is great in HR.<br><br>"Currently, artificial intelligence is most often used in sorting resumes. Automating resume screening saves overloaded HR professionals a lot of valuable minutes. Another possible use is in analyzing the applicant's assumptions and - as we have tried ourselves - also in communication with applicants. Last but not least, AI can also be helpful in onboarding and training," explains Lucie Krejčová.<br><br>According to experts, however, human contact will still be needed in HR.<br><br>"For us, artificial intelligence represents a significant streamlining of work, but I dare say that the human factor and soft skills will still play a primary role in our profession. We see artificial intelligence more as a good helper than a thief who will deprive recruiters of their jobs," says Lucie Krejčová from Moore Advisory CZ.<br><br>Artificial intelligence will continue to be used in consulting within Moore Advisory CZ. "Artificial intelligence helps us with the design of texts and procedures in various areas. This includes, for example, procedures for implementing certain measures or proposals for KPIs, which saves consultants time," says Martin Buranský from Moore Advisory CZ. "Although the use of artificial intelligence is an undeniable benefit, it is necessary to check the outputs, both formally and substantively. Sometimes AI is able to come up with real oddities," concludes Martin Buranský.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Experts at Moore Czech Republic predict that AI will enhance work efficiency rather than replace jobs, impacting sectors like administration and finance. A survey indicates 31% of Czechs fear job loss due to AI. AI is already being used to streamline recruitment, improving response rates and candidate quality. For instance, Moore Advisory CZ utilized ChatGPT to create a job description, resulting in a 70% response rate on LinkedIn and a pool of seven qualified candidates. AI is also used for resume screening, applicant analysis, communication, onboarding, and training. While AI aids in designing texts and procedures, human oversight remains essential to prevent errors. Experts believe human interaction and soft skills will still be crucial in HR, viewing AI as a helpful tool rather than a job threat.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_840" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_840" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_840" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_841" style="display:none;">Taxing non-financial benefits could strain wage growth and hinder recruitment efforts for Czech companies, according to experts at Moore Czech Republic. The proposed government consolidation package's limitation on tax advantages for these benefits could negatively impact the labor market and the economy, affecting both employers and employees. Employees often view benefits as part of their compensation, and eliminating them will likely create pressure for wage increases.<br><br>Furthermore, the removal of benefits could make it harder for companies to attract qualified workers in a tight labor market with a chronic shortage of skilled employees. Non-financial benefits are a tool for employers to make job positions more attractive, motivate employees, and build loyalty. The legislative change could also harm third parties, such as sports facilities and cultural event organizers, who benefit from revenue generated through these employee perks. Experts estimate that the planned changes could affect up to three out of four Czech employees. The benefit to the state budget is questionable and doesn't outweigh the potential negative consequences.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_841" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_841" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_841" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_842" style="display:none;">**Moore Advisory CZ: State Could Save Up to CZK 337 Million Annually by Adjusting Payments for Social Service Facilities**<br><br>A Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs analysis by Moore Advisory CZ suggests the state budget could save up to CZK 337 million annually by adjusting payment conditions for selected social service facilities. The study examined the possibility of clients in senior homes, facilities with special regimes, and homes for people with disabilities, or their relatives, contributing to care costs. It found that 52% of clients in these facilities have someone who could potentially contribute, but current willingness to contribute is only 27%.<br><br>The analysis, based on a survey of 1,000 clients, revealed that many clients have relatives who could partially cover the costs. In 40% of cases, the client has a descendant with a maintenance obligation. Proposed mandatory payments would include protective limits for both clients and those obliged to provide support, potentially capped at 20% of remaining income after living expenses. The average cost for basic services in residential facilities was almost CZK 14,500 per month per client as of October 2022. The analysis also considered implementing models similar to those in Germany and Austria, where children of social service clients are obligated to contribute to care based on their financial capacity. While the changes would involve increased personnel costs for financial testing, the net savings could reach CZK 337 million annually.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_842" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_842" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_842" style="display:none;"></p>

Many fintech startups have failed to adequately monetize their ideas, losing their competitive edge. However, digitalization, including AI solutions, will play a crucial role in the financial sector's development. Moore Czech Republic experts believe that the level of digitalization in the Czech financial sector is insufficient. Sustainability is also playing an increasingly important role in the world of finance and is gaining traction in the Czech Republic.<br><br>Moore Global has observed increased merger and acquisition activity among fintech startups. Investor interest in the financial sector remains, but it is shifting towards more traditional services or underserved regions. Experts say the Czech Republic lags in technology adoption in the financial sector due to a conservative approach from banks and customers. AI solutions are being used for credit scoring, but the financial sector is sensitive to replacing human interaction. ESG principles are gaining traction in finance, with firms focusing on their environmental impact. Investment managers are building ESG portfolios, and banks are interested in sustainably financing infrastructure projects. ESG principles are becoming more prominent in the Czech financial sector.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_844" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_844" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_844" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_845" style="display:none;">The National Qualification System (NSK) helps individuals seeking better employment by providing state-supported, nationally recognized professional qualifications without formal schooling. A large-scale survey conducted in autumn 2021 and early 2023 as part of the UpSkilling project revealed varying levels of awareness and utilization across target groups: schools, the Labour Office, and employers.<br><br>Labour Office employees demonstrate the highest awareness (94%) and usage (79%) of NSK, primarily for retraining and professional qualification exams. Schools are aware of NSK (77%) and use it for developing educational programs, but active utilization is lower (22%). Employers exhibit the lowest awareness (35%) and usage (10%), though their knowledge and utilization significantly increased between survey rounds.<br><br>Workshops within the UpSkilling project contributed to this positive growth, especially among employers. While NSK usage has doubled, employers still lag behind schools and the Labour Office. Future plans indicate continued use of NSK by all groups for educational and retraining purposes. To maximize NSK's effectiveness, further focus is needed on employer engagement and utilization, particularly through targeted activities like workshops, to ensure all stakeholders benefit from the system.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_845" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_845" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_845" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_846" style="display:none;">Tourism rebounded from Covid last year and is expected to grow this year, with established brands leading the way. Experts at Moore Global anticipate continued expansion in 2023, particularly among large hotel chains adopting the franchise model, which could benefit smaller businesses. Moore Czech Republic predicts global trends like ESG, automation, and "bleisure" (business and leisure travel) will influence the domestic sector. Travel agencies also foresee expansion, reporting significantly higher advance sales.<br><br>While Covid severely impacted tourism, 2022 saw a return of customers, and 2023 promises further growth. Travelers will favor well-known brands, driving expansion for major hotel chains through franchising, offering smaller hotels opportunities to operate under trusted corporate banners. Czech tourism is recovering, with revenues reaching 118 billion crowns in 2022, a 51 billion crown increase year-on-year, but still below the 167 billion crown pre-Covid level in 2019. Adaptation to global trends will be crucial.<br><br>The "bleisure" model is gaining traction, potentially growing by 20% annually. Czech hotels can capitalize on this trend, as well as prioritize ESG principles to attract investment. Automation is also rising in the hospitality sector, and early adoption of technologies like AI will be vital for competitiveness. Travel agencies are anticipating a highly profitable year, with advance sales doubling compared to last year. Popular destinations include Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Spain, and Albania, with growing interest in sightseeing tours.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_846" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_846" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_846" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_847" style="display:none;">Whistleblowers save companies money and improve corporate culture. The announcement system needs to be built now.<br><br>Delays in transposing the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive into Czech law are problematic not only for the Czech Republic, which has been sued by the European Commission as a result, but also for businesses. According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, Czech companies face significant financial losses without an effective internal reporting system. The new legislation, the Whistleblower Protection Act, is intended to protect whistleblowers who report illegal activities within companies. Companies with more than fifty employees will be obligated to establish an internal reporting system, allowing employees to confidentially and anonymously report suspected wrongdoing.<br><br>Experts emphasize the need for companies to proactively create these systems, warning against last-minute panic similar to GDPR implementation. Furthermore, having a robust internal system against corruption can be considered a mitigating circumstance in legal proceedings against a company.<br><br>Financially, whistleblowing can prevent substantial losses. The EU estimates annual losses from the lack of whistleblower protection to be €5.8 to €9.6 billion in public procurement alone. In the Czech Republic, 40% of companies encountering economic crime lost at least CZK 1,200,000. Internal reporting systems aim to address this by making management aware of illegal employee activities.<br><br>Ultimately, fostering a culture that supports whistleblowers, removing the stigma associated with them, is crucial. Whistleblowers contribute to an atmosphere of openness and transparency, improving employee-management relations and reducing the risk of sanctions and customer rejection. Moore Czech Republic offers expertise in creating and managing these effective whistleblower protection systems.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_847" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_847" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_847" style="display:none;"></p>

Community power plants will be a new trend.<br><br>May 3, 2023<br><br>Experts from the consulting network Moore Global consider adherence to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) principles a condition for maintaining competitiveness in the energy industry. They also point out the possibility of using big data to analyze energy consumption and production to increase efficiency. According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, adapting to the new trend of community power plants will be important for the Czech energy market. These will enable both greater sustainability of the energy industry and more stable energy prices.<br><br>The shift towards renewable sources has been influenced by many factors, including technological advancements and government incentives.<br><br>"Investments in physical infrastructure aimed at reducing carbon emissions are obvious at first glance, but what happens behind the scenes can be equally important. Today, it is possible to collect and analyze vast amounts of information about energy usage. This data can be used to optimize the functioning of energy systems, leading to more efficient and cost-effective energy production and consumption,"<br><br>describes David Tomasi, global leader in energy, mining, and renewables at Moore Global.<br><br>Moore Czech Republic experts add that the Czech Republic can also benefit from optimizing electricity production using big data.<br><br>"For example, the Temelín nuclear power plant wants to save up to 4,000 megawatt-hours of emission-free electricity next year. It intends to achieve this by adjusting the operation of cooling tower pumps and will use big data for this purpose,"<br><br>adds Pavel Drobil, partner at Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>Return to the past<br><br>Energy supply disruptions that Europe has been experiencing since last year have resulted in increased interest in using non-renewable fossil fuels.<br><br>"One of the consequences of the energy crisis is that the emphasis on using energy from renewable sources is practically decreasing. The use of fossil fuels is growing again, and even states are more lenient towards it. We can see this, for example, in Germany, where the lifespan of thermal power plants is being extended,"<br><br>comments Pavel Drobil.<br><br>Czech Republic awaits community power plants<br><br>Experts from Moore Czech Republic believe that the energy market in the Czech Republic will fundamentally change after the adoption of legislation enabling the expansion of community power plants.<br><br>"Peer-to-peer energy sharing within virtual power plants will enable a more environmentally friendly approach and will also contribute to stabilizing energy prices. This type of power plant could cover up to 25% of the total domestic electricity consumption in the future,"<br><br>explains Miroslav Rut, partner at Moore Technology CZ.<br><br>Experts emphasize the importance of ESG principles for competitiveness in the energy sector and highlight the potential of big data to optimize energy production and consumption, leading to greater efficiency and cost savings. The Temelín nuclear power plant is cited as an example of a large entity utilizing big data for operational improvements. The European energy crisis has led to a resurgence in fossil fuel use, with countries extending the lifespans of thermal power plants. For the Czech Republic, a significant transformation in the energy market is anticipated with the introduction of community power plants, which will facilitate peer-to-peer energy sharing and virtual power plants. These community initiatives are expected to enhance environmental sustainability and stabilize energy prices, potentially meeting up to 25% of the country's electricity demand.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_848" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_848" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_848" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_850" style="display:none;">Virtual power plants are poised to transform the energy market in the Czech Republic, potentially supplying up to 25% of the country's electricity in the medium term, according to experts from Moore Czech Republic. This shift hinges on the adoption of appropriate legislation to enable community energy and peer-to-peer energy sharing. The recent energy crisis, which saw Czech electricity prices soar the highest in the EU, has been a significant driver for preparing this legislation.<br><br>Miloslav Rut, a partner at Moore Czech Republic, highlights that virtual power plants, with an estimated production cost of around 3 CZK per kWh, could help mitigate rising electricity prices. However, the necessary legislative framework, adapted from EU regulations, is still under development and expected to commence around mid-year. Rut emphasizes the importance of defining community boundaries, favoring geographically localized communities. A key challenge identified is the strain on distribution networks; therefore, strengthening infrastructure alongside facilitating community energy is crucial. Incentivizing communities operating within a single distribution transformer would be particularly beneficial.<br><br>Virtual power plants offer the prospect of greener and cheaper energy by enabling consumers to cover part of their needs with local renewable production. Municipalities, for instance, can leverage solar panels on public buildings to power local consumption, with surplus energy supplied to citizens or the grid. While some energy suppliers in the Czech Republic focus on renewables, they do not currently offer peer-to-peer sharing, which is the core principle of virtual power plants.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_850" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_850" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_850" style="display:none;"></p>

Russia's share of total EU exports has fallen by more than half since February last year.<br><br>February 23, 2023<br><br>Foreign trade between the European Union and Russia has significantly declined since February 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This affects both exports and imports. According to the latest Eurostat data, in February 2022, the Russian Federation accounted for 9.5 percent of imports into EU countries from non-EU states. Six months later, in September of last year, this figure had dropped to just 5.3 percent. In the same period, the share of exports from the EU to Russia decreased from 4 percent to 1.8 percent, a fall of over half.<br><br>The most drastic decline in imports from Russia to the EU has been in coal, falling by more than two-thirds. Before the war, 45% of coal came from Russia; in the third quarter of 2022, it was only 13%. The share of natural gas and oil imports was reduced by roughly half. Significant decreases were also observed in fertilizers, iron, and steel. For some raw materials, such as nickel, values actually increased during the observed period.<br><br>"Russia's importance as a trading partner for the EU has naturally decreased significantly in connection with the war, particularly concerning imports of energy and certain other raw materials into the European Union, which are restricted by EU sanctions. Initial uncertainty caused record energy price growth in European countries. However, we can be sure that Russian economy will be much more severely affected by these sanctions," comments Petr Kymlička, partner at advisory group Moore Czech Republic, adding that precise impact assessment is practically impossible due to the absence of reliable data on the Russian economy.<br><br>Exports dropped sharply, imports gradually.<br><br>Russia's share of total EU exports plummeted by about half month-on-month shortly after the invasion. Conversely, imports of commodities from Russia decreased gradually.<br><br>"Those who had the ability and willingness to stop exporting to Russia did so practically immediately. Imports from Russia could not be restricted so drastically; many states, including the Czech Republic, were dependent on supplies, especially of gas and oil. Imports therefore decreased gradually as alternative supplies were secured from other countries," Kymlička adds, noting that currently, the EU mainly exports medicines, food, and agricultural products to Russia, which are not subject to EU sanctions.<br><br>The balance of European-Russian foreign trade peaked in March last year, reaching 18.1 billion euros. By September, it had fallen to just 10.5 billion euros. The restriction of foreign trade is negatively impacting the performance of the Russian economy.<br><br>"The Russian economy is already experiencing significant weakening. Although official statistics speak of a GDP decline of around 2.5%, it is highly probable that this figure is heavily distorted and the real value is between 10 and 20%," concludes Petr Kymlička.<br><br>The Russian aggression has led to a significant decline in EU-Russia foreign trade. Russia's share of total EU imports fell from 9.5% in February 2022 to 5.3% by September. Similarly, EU exports to Russia dropped by over half, from 4% to 1.8%. The most affected import categories include coal, natural gas, oil, fertilizers, iron, and steel, with coal imports from Russia decreasing by over two-thirds. While some raw material imports saw increases, the overall trend reflects the impact of EU sanctions. Experts suggest the Russian economy is significantly weakened, with actual GDP decline likely much higher than official figures indicate. The trade balance between the EU and Russia also shrunk considerably.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_853" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_853" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_853" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_854" style="display:none;">Firms are increasingly collaborating with schools to cultivate future employees.<br><br>February 23, 2023<br><br>Czech companies are strengthening their partnerships with universities and secondary schools to bridge the gap between education and practice. This collaboration benefits all parties, and for many companies, it's the only way to secure qualified and promising future employees. Experts from Moore Czech Republic note that industries, particularly manufacturing, are experiencing a significant increase in the average time needed to train new graduates. They aim to counteract this by integrating practical experience into education.<br><br>Czech graduates enjoy a strong position in the European job market due to a heated labor market, resulting in one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in Europe. Since spring 2018 until January of this year, there were more job openings than applicants in the Czech Republic. Lucie Krejčová from Moore Advisory CZ highlights that young Czechs are typically willing to relocate for work, a flexibility that is more challenging for older workers with established lives, contributing to structural unemployment in some regions.<br><br>The current demographic trend of fewer young people entering the workforce, born at the turn of the 21st century, exacerbates the existing worker shortage. Krejčová also points out that the quality of graduates from Czech secondary and higher education institutions is a concern. Clients are reporting increased difficulty in recruiting and training graduates, especially in technical fields, but shortages are also evident in economic positions. Graduates often lack practical experience, such as operating machinery.<br><br>To address this, companies are supporting education through school partnerships, aiming to improve graduate skill levels and gain a recruitment advantage. Radovan Hauk from Moore Czech Republic observes that while collaboration with industry has increased at leading Czech schools, there is still room for deeper integration that could benefit the entire country, without compromising academic roles.<br><br>Moore Czech Republic is actively fostering these educational collaborations. Beyond basic partnerships with universities like the University of Economics and the Czech University of Life Sciences, they have announced a strategic collaboration with Sting University, offering 100% scholarships to selected students in accounting to fill specialized and managerial roles immediately after graduation. The group plans to expand these intensive collaborations to secondary schools this year, focusing on accounting, finance, and information technology.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_854" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_854" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_854" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_855" style="display:none;">Sting offers a 100% scholarship and a dream career.<br><br>February 14, 2023<br><br>Imagine gaining practical experience at an attractive company while still studying, earning money, and having the company pay for your tuition. Sounds good?<br><br>Sting College has entered into an exclusive partnership with Moore Czech Republic, a leader in auditing and consulting firms, and has introduced a new initiative that gives its students a significant career head start. Starting in 2023, Moore will not only provide selected students with practical experience and employment in the promising field of accounting, but will also grant them a 100% scholarship.<br><br>"Moore specifically prepares these individuals to fill higher positions, which would be more difficult to achieve after graduation without practical experience," adds Sting's rector, Jiří Koleňák, to the overall plan. The great news is that Sting is also offering this opportunity to students of combined study programs.<br><br>If you, as a Sting student, apply for the project and pass the selection process, you will receive paid practical experience throughout your three years of study, which is specifically designed to prepare you for financially very attractive positions in the future. Upon graduation, Moore will offer you an interesting position and an above-average starting salary in a field that is increasingly attractive to young people due to its flexibility and growing digitalization.<br><br>The field of accounting is developing very dynamically, responding to current trends and the demands of the younger generation. "Today, you don't have to sit in an office from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.; you can work from home. It's an ideal job for a woman with children, or for young people who don't want to be tied to fixed working hours," explains Radovan Hauk, a partner at Moore Czech Republic. "The new generation will bring their confident orientation in the digital environment to this field. Thanks to this, they have the opportunity to master the field completely," adds Jiří Koleňák.<br><br>Accounting will undergo radical development in the future thanks to digitalization. Accountants will be freed from routine, error-prone tasks. You will no longer have to deal with tedious transactions, but will have room for more creative and sophisticated work, which is also very well paid. "Independent accountants earn an average of 50,000 CZK, and in Prague, the salary for a head accountant starts from 80,000 CZK upwards," explains Radovan Hauk. Sting College thus fulfills its commitment to prepare students for competition in the job market. Sting's vision is to educate capable, flexible individuals who understand industry trends, gain valuable experience through practical work, and can thus grow their careers very quickly. "Students will receive a clear benefit for their academic efforts and will effectively combine theory with practice," concludes Jiří Koleňák.<br><br>---<br><br>Sting College has partnered with Moore Czech Republic to offer a unique opportunity for selected students: a 100% scholarship, paid practical experience for three years, and guaranteed employment upon graduation. This initiative aims to give students a significant career advantage in the dynamic field of accounting. The program is designed to prepare students for higher-paying roles, with starting salaries for head accountants in Prague exceeding 80,000 CZK. Moore emphasizes the growing flexibility of accounting careers, including remote work options, appealing to the modern workforce. The digitalization of accounting will shift focus from routine tasks to more creative and sophisticated work. This collaboration aligns with Sting's mission to produce well-rounded, adaptable graduates ready for the job market, effectively bridging theory and practice.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_855" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_855" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_855" style="display:none;"></p>

Only Romania and Bulgaria saw larger increases, while Hungary shared the third spot with the Czech Republic. In contrast, 19 EU member states recorded a decrease in energy consumption. Experts anticipate further energy consumption declines across Europe in the coming months due to cost-saving measures by businesses and households in response to high prices. The Czech Republic, facing some of the highest prices, is expected to see significant consumption reductions in 2022 and 2023.<br><br>Overall, the EU saw a 2.1% decrease in energy consumption, with Central and Eastern European countries primarily driving the growth. Malta achieved the largest savings at 10%. Experts note that Western European countries were more successful in implementing energy-saving measures compared to the Czech Republic. Looking ahead, high electricity prices are likely to continue to drive energy-saving initiatives across the EU, impacting overall consumption.<br><br>The EU’s final energy consumption in 2021 was 14.4% above its 2030 target. While the EU’s overall energy consumption has been decreasing since 2006, reaching the 2030 target of 850 million tonnes of oil equivalent would require an annual saving of approximately 2.1%, a rate equivalent to the overall drop recorded between the pre-pandemic years and 2021.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_857" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_857" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_857" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_858" style="display:none;">Digitalization is the future of the financial sector, but the Czech Republic lags behind. A recent McKinsey & Company report indicates that 51% of banks have a return on equity lower than their cost of equity. Experts from Moore Global attribute this to slow digitalization, contrasting it with the high adoption rates seen in fintech startups and progressive financial companies.<br><br>Fintech startups have emerged as significant players, offering innovative products and services beyond traditional banks, driven by smart technologies. Ewen Fleming of Moore Global highlights the rapid pace of innovation, stating that many traditional players are unprepared. He advises traditional banks to redefine their purpose, diversify their customer base, and focus on building profitable segments while managing risks effectively.<br><br>The burgeoning fintech sector is pushing traditional banks toward innovation. Petr Kymlička of Moore Czech Republic predicts a future where new technologies are paramount in finance, with fintech integrating more areas and traditional institutions increasingly resembling fintech firms, blurring the lines between them.<br><br>In post-communist countries, including the Czech Republic, the financial sector appears less developed technologically compared to Western nations. Kymlička notes that fintech's contribution to the Czech financial sector's total revenue is only in the low single digits, largely due to conservative approaches from both banks and customers. However, he observes recent improvements driven by increased digital literacy, better technology access, and reduced language barriers. He also points to significant venture capital allocation to fintech, crucial for project development.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_858" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_858" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_858" style="display:none;"></p>

This affects approximately two million OSVČ and 200,000 legal entities. A survey by Moore Czech Republic found that 86% of self-employed individuals were aware of this change by the end of 2022.<br><br>Experts view this transition as a crucial step in the digitalization of public administration, simplifying communication, increasing efficiency, saving costs, and benefiting the environment. While about half of surveyed OSVČ already had a data box, the Ministry of the Interior expects an additional 2.2 million to be established in early 2023. The transition is anticipated to be smooth, given the high awareness among OSVČ and the active usage rates of existing data boxes. Access codes will be sent via registered mail by the end of March 2023. A potential issue may arise for those with outdated addresses on their identification documents, as all official correspondence will be considered automatically delivered once placed in the data box, following a change in legislation.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_859" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_859" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_859" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_860" style="display:none;">New Flat-Rate Tax System: Exceeding the Limit by a Thousand Koruna Can Mean an Increase in Levies of Up to 120,000<br><br>December 15, 2022<br><br>A recently passed amendment to the Income Tax Act introduces an increase in the income limit for self-employed individuals (OSVČ) to join the flat-rate tax regime. It also implements a tiered system where entrepreneurs will pay different flat-rate tax amounts based on their income. The Ministry of Finance expects this new legislation to enhance the attractiveness of the flat-rate tax. Experts from the consulting group Moore Czech Republic agree but highlight that the new system is overly complex and likely to deter many potential participants. For OSVČ, controlling income will be more critical than ever.<br><br>The uptake of the flat-rate tax regime by OSVČ has so far fallen short of the Ministry of Finance's expectations. Martin Pech from Moore Czech Republic cited the regime's relative newness, strict January 10th entry deadline, and the fact that OSVČ typically handle their taxes over a year later as reasons for the low adoption. Currently, only about 79,000 OSVČ are in the flat-rate system, out of over 1 million in the Czech Republic.<br><br>Pech views the increased income limit as positive, but stresses that the proposed tiered structure and conditions for determining which tier an OSVČ falls into can be very complicated. This complexity arises from the need to calculate applicable expenditure allowances (60% or 80%) based on their various activities, making it difficult for those with diverse income streams to determine their correct tax bracket. He advises OSVČ to conduct control calculations at the end of each year and consult with a tax advisor if unsure, as miscalculations could lead to annual levy differences exceeding 100,000 koruna.<br><br>The system also has implications for income fluctuations. If income drops and an OSVČ qualifies for a lower tier, they can switch and receive a refund. However, if income increases and they move to a higher tier, they must remain in that tier for at least one year, even if their income later qualifies them for a lower one. This inflexibility might make exiting the flat-rate system more advantageous in some cases. Pech warns that a mere thousand koruna increase in income above a tier's limit could result in a 120,000 koruna increase in annual levies.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_860" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_860" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_860" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_861" style="display:none;">Deteriorating financing, restricted investments, and layoffs await Czech businesses in the coming months.<br><br>Czech companies are bracing for the consequences of an expected recession. Beyond worsening economic performance due to record inflation and reduced demand, businesses will also face investment limitations, potentially leading to temporary or permanent operational interruptions. Experts from Moore Czech Republic highlight both short-term challenges and long-term impacts. Companies will need to adapt through changes in education, digitalization, and energy productivity to maintain competitiveness. Over half of Czech firms anticipate a decline in economic results compared to earlier plans, primarily driven by inflation, which reached 15.1% year-on-year in October 2022. Inflation harms businesses by increasing input costs and reducing customer purchasing power, with demand reduction expected to be most pronounced in the first half of next year, pushing the Czech economy towards stagflation.<br><br>Short-term effects include deteriorating operational financing, forcing businesses to cut costs, reduce non-essential purchases, and implement layoffs. Companies will struggle with liquidity and face difficulties obtaining credit due to rising interest rates and bank caution. Strategic investments are likely to be restricted or postponed, and some financially weaker, energy-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises may cease operations entirely.<br><br>Long-term, energy-intensive firms with low productivity must invest in technological innovation to enhance energy efficiency and competitiveness, as energy prices are unlikely to return to previous levels. Future success will depend on focusing on high-value activities and customer segments, with a strong emphasis on research and development for industrial enterprises. Human resource management will be crucial, with firms seeking digital and automated solutions to offset rising labor costs. Upskilling and reskilling employees will be essential due to technological advancements, an aging population, and generational shifts. The Czech Republic lags in adult education, impacting economic performance, productivity, and competitiveness, necessitating government support. Demographic trends will increase demand for foreign workers and more flexible employment arrangements, potentially integrating economically inactive segments of the population, such as seniors and caregivers, into the workforce.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_861" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_861" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_861" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_862" style="display:none;">Companies prioritizing ESG see their revenues grow twice as fast, with their stocks also performing better. A survey by Moore Global reveals that businesses actively engaging with ESG principles experienced a 9.1% profit increase over the past three years, more than double the 3.7% growth of laggard firms. Eighty-four percent of companies recognizing ESG's importance reported an improved ability to attract external investors. Stock market data supports this, showing sustainable stocks yielded around 28% compared to a 22.3% overall market return last year. The MSCI World SRI index, comprising ESG-focused companies, outperformed a similar non-ESG index by 1.7 percentage points annually between 2016 and 2021. Globally, nearly 80% of large corporations consider ESG more important than three years ago, with only 6% showing no interest.<br><br>However, the Czech Republic lags behind Western Europe in ESG adoption, with a lack of broad awareness. A June survey by Moore Czech Republic found only 25% of senior managers in medium and large Czech firms are familiar with ESG. While awareness is growing, some firms have deprioritized ESG due to economic downturn concerns. Nevertheless, customers increasingly value ESG, with 89% of retailers focused on ESG retaining customers better. The ESG consulting market in the Czech Republic, currently in the tens of millions of Czech crowns, is projected to grow significantly to hundreds of millions annually within 3-5 years, driven by upcoming legislation. This new legislation will expand mandatory ESG reporting to publicly traded companies with over 500 employees in 2025, and to businesses with over 250 employees or significant financial metrics in 2026. Small and medium-sized listed companies will also need to issue non-financial reports from 2027.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_862" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_862" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_862" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_863" style="display:none;">The Czech economy benefits from a balanced distribution of value added among businesses of different sizes. Small businesses contribute 35% of the total value added, while medium-sized enterprises (50-249 employees) account for 21%, and large companies (over 250 employees) make up the remaining 44%. This structure is considered advantageous for overall economic stability and development.<br><br>In terms of employment, small businesses employ around 48% of the workforce, medium-sized firms 19%, and large companies 33%. This balance places the Czech Republic near the European average, which is seen positively by experts. The country's business structure is a success, especially considering the historical near-elimination of small and micro enterprises post-WWII.<br><br>While small businesses are more vulnerable to economic downturns, their flexibility allows for quick replacement, mitigating significant unemployment impacts. This is further supported by the Czech Republic's low unemployment rate, which can absorb company failures. Comparing to other EU states, the Czech Republic's distribution is better than Italy, where small businesses contribute half the value added, and only five EU states, including Germany, have a smaller contribution from small and micro enterprises. Estonia also shows a significant contribution from small and medium businesses, while Ireland, due to its tax system, relies heavily on large corporations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_863" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_863" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_863" style="display:none;"></p>

In the analyzed period, the EU average investment was significantly higher at 244.3 euros per capita, while Czechia's annual increase in R&D investment last year was below average at 1.4% compared to the EU's 6.3%. Experts emphasize that increasing these investments is crucial for transforming the Czech economy into one with higher added value and for attracting foreign investors.<br><br>While the absolute amount invested in R&D in Czechia has grown, its share of the state budget has decreased. In 2020, the state budget allocated 2.1% to R&D, a decrease from 2017. Experts note that state support for R&D acts as an impulse for the private sector, encouraging corporate investment. Long-term state spending focuses on knowledge development, primarily within universities and the Academy of Sciences. However, a significant challenge is the growing difficulty in connecting education with practical application and fostering closer cooperation between schools and companies, particularly in technical fields, to address a future shortage of skilled technical workers. Despite efforts to catch up with Western and Northern European countries, the gap in R&D investment remains substantial. However, within the former Eastern Bloc, Czechia's R&D investment as a percentage of GDP (0.64% in 2020) was the second highest after Estonia, and per capita investment also ranked highly among these nations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_864" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_864" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_864" style="display:none;"></p>

Its GDP was only 97.8% of its 2019 value. A Moore Czech Republic analysis revealed that 10 EU countries hadn't recovered, with Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Austria faring worse than the Czech Republic. While 17 EU countries surpassed their 2019 GDP by late 2021, the Czech Republic did not. The country experienced the tenth strongest economic decline in 2020 and the fourth weakest growth in 2021.<br><br>Reasons cited for this underperformance include often exaggerated and chaotic anti-epidemic measures and unsystematic state support. These measures, intended to curb the pandemic, also failed to significantly reduce deaths, with the Czech Republic having the fourth worst death rate per million inhabitants in the EU.<br><br>Despite extensive government compensation and support aimed at mitigating the pandemic's economic impact, experts believe these measures missed an opportunity to streamline the market by removing inefficient businesses, thereby hindering a shift towards a higher value-added economy. Furthermore, fiscal expansion contributed to a dramatic increase in inflation, making the Czech Republic one of the most affected nations. Neighboring Germany, Austria, and Slovakia also saw GDP below 99% of their 2019 levels, with Austria performing slightly worse than the Czech Republic. Poland, however, experienced overall economic growth of 3.6% over two years. Ireland emerged as the top performer, with its GDP increasing by over 20% since the end of 2019, attributed to targeted, time-limited restrictions and its status as a developed knowledge economy focused on services and high-tech industries, benefiting from economic freedom and foreign investment. Nine EU countries, including Ireland and Poland, saw overall GDP growth exceeding 2% from the end of 2019.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_868" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_868" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_868" style="display:none;"></p>

The Czech Republic is undergoing a dynamic shift in strategic planning for its regions, cities, and municipalities over the next five years. New strategic planning tools, including megatrends, foresight, forecasting, scenario building, and early warning systems, are being introduced to improve preparedness and decision-making processes. This is driven by increasing uncertainties that necessitate better future predictions.<br><br>The UK's extensive use of foresight since the 1990s has been influential. Foresight, a system of qualitative and quantitative tools, helps prepare for future developments. Currently, Czech municipalities tend to focus heavily on analyzing the past, with analytical sections making up a significant portion of strategic documents, contrary to recommended guidelines that emphasize future-oriented thinking. Pilot programs in five Czech cities have tested these innovative tools, with foresight being particularly crucial.<br><br>The Ministry for Local Development is supporting this modernization through methodological recommendations and training modules. These tools have been successfully applied in cities of various sizes, demonstrating their applicability. The ultimate goal is to achieve higher-quality strategic planning that enables timely responses to future needs, thereby increasing the efficiency of financial resources and improving citizens' quality of life.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_869" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_869" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_869" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_871" style="display:none;">Only a quarter of managers are aware of ESG, which will affect thousands of companies starting next year.<br><br>A survey by Moore Czech Republic reveals that only 25% of managers are familiar with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. Despite this low awareness, a new European directive will mandate ESG reporting for thousands of Czech companies starting in 2023. This requirement will gradually extend to all large companies with over 250 employees and publicly traded small and medium-sized enterprises.<br><br>Interestingly, among those who are aware of ESG, nearly three-quarters view it as a beneficial step. These informed managers see ESG as a strategic advantage, crucial for maintaining competitiveness and potentially increasing profitability. Many recognize the importance of social responsibility and sustainability in their business practices.<br><br>However, the overall lack of awareness is concerning. Experts emphasize the urgency for companies to educate themselves and adapt to ESG strategies and related legislation, as reporting will soon become unavoidable. Banks are already beginning to consider ESG data when assessing loan opportunities and pricing. The Moore network is actively preparing to support clients in this evolving landscape, with a European meeting planned to share best practices. The success of this transition hinges on whether companies embrace the new requirements proactively or perceive them as mere bureaucracy.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_871" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_871" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_871" style="display:none;"></p>

While a majority (six out of ten) believe more women in management benefit a company, many doubt the authority of women who achieve positions through quotas, with significant numbers of both men and women believing their authority wouldn't be comparable to those who advance through merit.<br><br>The survey also indicates that the topic of quotas is not widely discussed or perceived as important by the general public. Experts suggest that implementing quotas could disrupt corporate succession planning and internal culture. Instead of quotas, the focus should be on supporting women's career development through flexible work arrangements, childcare support, and educational initiatives that challenge traditional stereotypes.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_873" style="display:none;">There is no room for a 2,000 increase in the minimum wage. Nevertheless, companies are paying more on their own.<br><br>Companies, alongside rising raw material prices and higher interest rates, may face another cost threat in the form of enforced higher wages. According to experts at the consulting group Moore Czech Republic, it is not the right time for such a significant increase, and in the context of high demand in the labor market, it is an unnecessary administrative step. Many employees are achieving wage growth – companies are driven to increase them precisely by labor shortages.<br><br>Due to the state of the labor market, where there has been a long-term shortage of labor in many professions, companies are forced to give employees raises if they don't want to lose them. During the first quarter of this year, the nominal average wage increased by 7.2% year-on-year. Considering the rapid growth of consumer prices, it is clear that most workers will not see a real improvement this year.<br><br>"Employers are trying to retain their employees by increasing wages so they don't go to the competition, for example. It's a natural step, as replacing them is either many times more expensive or even impossible," states Radovan Hauk, partner at Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>Experts from Moore Czech Republic point out that although less than 3% of employed people work for the minimum wage in the Czech Republic, the impact of this change would be much wider, as the guaranteed wage also increases with the minimum wage. This sets the lowest possible wage for individual professions, which are divided into eight so-called occupational groups and arranged by complexity, effort, and responsibility.<br><br>"A leap increase in the minimum wage would particularly harm smaller businesses in sectors with lower added value and therefore low margins. It is precisely for them that this change, along with other external factors such as rising input prices, more difficult credit, or reduced sales, could be fatal," warns Radovan Hauk, adding that wage growth significantly exceeding labor productivity contributes to the emphasis on digitalization and automation, which often replaces the activities of low-skilled labor.<br><br>Changes at the European level.<br><br>The minimum wage varies significantly across the European Union. While the highest is in Luxembourg (2,257 euros) and Ireland (1,775 euros), the lowest is set in Bulgaria (332 euros) and Latvia (500 euros). The Czech Republic, with its 16,200 CZK (656 euros), ranks fifth from the bottom. Negotiations are currently underway within the European Union between the European Council, the European Commission, and the European Parliament on a proposal for new unifying legislation. According to Radovan Hauk, setting the minimum wage level should remain entirely with individual member states. The increase must reflect the state of the economy, the specifics of the national economy, and, above all, productivity growth.<br><br>"A radical increase in the minimum wage, which could result from a potential European Union regulation, would put domestic employers in a difficult situation and would certainly lead to a loss of competitiveness," he concludes, adding that potential legislative unification will not apply to the six countries that do not have the institution of the minimum wage at all. These are Denmark, Finland, Italy, Cyprus, Austria, and Sweden.<br><br>Companies are facing increased costs from rising raw materials, higher interest rates, and the potential for enforced higher wages. Experts believe now is not the time for a significant minimum wage hike, especially given the strong demand for labor. Businesses are already proactively increasing wages to retain employees due to shortages, as replacing staff is often more expensive or impossible. While few people earn the minimum wage, an increase affects guaranteed wages for all professions. Smaller businesses in low-margin sectors would be particularly vulnerable to such a change, potentially leading to fatal consequences when combined with other economic pressures. The push for digitalization and automation is also a response to rising labor costs that outpace productivity. Across the EU, minimum wages vary greatly, with the Czech Republic ranking low. Proposed EU-wide minimum wage legislation is being discussed, but experts advocate for national autonomy in setting wages, emphasizing the need to align increases with economic conditions and productivity growth. They warn that a drastic EU-mandated increase could harm Czech employers' competitiveness, excluding countries without a minimum wage system.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_873" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_873" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_873" style="display:none;"></p>

While rising credit costs play a role, the primary driver is the high inflation rate, which diminishes the value of cash holdings and purchased assets, especially real estate. This caution prompts many sellers to re-evaluate or postpone transactions.<br><br>Furthermore, increased interest rates, a response to inflation, make financing more expensive. This impacts both the structure of deals and the fundamental decision of whether to invest at all. Even completed transactions financed with variable-rate loans face risks if hedging strategies aren't in place, potentially eroding investment rationales as real profits decline. The fear of losing purchasing power on bank deposits also contributes to investor hesitancy.

An increase would help vulnerable groups and contribute to labor market flexibility.<br><br>Radim Darebník<br><br>May 25, 2022<br><br>This type of contractual relationship is often used by single mothers or pensioners due to its flexibility. The current limit of ten thousand Czech crowns has been in place since 2012, while consumer prices have increased by 38% since then. Raising this limit would incentivize employers to create new job opportunities and hire people for part-time roles. Furthermore, it would help many individuals better manage the current and anticipated rapid rise in the cost of living. This change would enhance labor market flexibility and partially address the shortage of employees.<br><br>When working under an agreement to perform work (DPP), if an employee signs a taxpayer's declaration for earnings up to 10,000 CZK, they are exempt from income tax and health and social insurance contributions. The last increase to this limit occurred in 2012, raising it from 5,000 CZK to the current 10,000 CZK. For context, the average gross monthly wage has increased by 51% since then, and the minimum wage has risen by 103% in the last decade. In line with consumer price increases, monetary thresholds for offenses and crimes have also recently been adjusted.<br><br>"Ten thousand crowns held significantly more value ten years ago than it does today. This is reflected in many areas, but not yet for agreements to perform work. Therefore, it would make sense to consider this in the context of increasing the limit that determines the exemption from social and health insurance contributions and withholding tax," states Radovan Hauk, partner at Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>An increase of 5,000 CZK<br><br>According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, an increase in the limit would be welcomed by both employers and the demographic groups for whom this employment arrangement is intended, namely students, pensioners, and parents on parental leave who are already insured by law. "Given the rise in inflation and wages since 2012, when the current limit for withholding tax on agreements to perform work of 10,000 CZK was established, the current economic situation would correspond to a limit of around 15,000 CZK. An increased limit would lead employers to expand their offerings of part-time jobs through agreements to perform work," says Radovan Hauk. Additionally, the change could at least partially address the long-standing labor market issue of a surplus of vacancies.<br><br>"Information from our membership base indicates that the use of agreements to perform work has slightly decreased in recent years because the limit is too low and no longer makes economic sense. Agreements to perform work have always been a useful tool for earning extra income and gradually integrating into the workforce, whether for young people during their studies or for mothers preparing to return to work after parental leave. Well-structured agreements also allow employers to cover demand fluctuations and fulfill orders with time constraints more quickly," adds Tomáš Prouza, President of the Association of Commerce and Tourism of the Czech Republic and Vice President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>The sooner, the better<br><br>Although the increase of this limit has been discussed periodically over the past few years, Moore Czech Republic believes there has never been a more opportune time for this systemic change. Agreements to perform work are utilized by seniors and single mothers, groups most vulnerable to the current rapid increase in consumer prices.<br><br>"An increase in the limits would be a significant help to people working under this agreement. Simultaneously, there will be increasing demand for employment through DPP from employees who, due to rising living costs, will be forced to seek secondary employment alongside their main job," concludes Radovan Hauk, adding that the change could at least partially assist the domestic labor market.<br><br>Prices are rising, but the limit for agreements to perform work (DPP) has remained unchanged since 2012. This stagnation, despite a 38% increase in consumer prices, is disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups like single mothers and pensioners who rely on DPP for its flexibility. Experts argue that raising the 10,000 CZK limit to around 15,000 CZK is crucial. Such an adjustment would incentivize employers to create more part-time roles, helping to fill labor shortages and provide much-needed income support to individuals struggling with rising living costs. This change is seen as a timely measure to boost the flexibility of the labor market and alleviate financial pressure on specific demographics.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_876" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_876" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_876" style="display:none;"></p>

Furthermore, the use of renewable energy sources in the Czech Republic has consistently been below average. The country also registers a very small number of emission-free cars.<br><br>However, the Czech Republic performs well in statistics related to railway transport utilization. In 2019, railways accounted for 9.9% of all passenger transport and 26.2% of freight transport in the Czech Republic, both significantly higher than the EU averages of 8% and 17.6% respectively. Despite lagging in other climate protection areas, the increasing trend in renewable energy use, from 10.5% in 2010 to 17.3% in 2020, offers potential for improvement. The low adoption of electric vehicles is attributed to high purchase prices, underdeveloped charging infrastructure, and a lack of government financial support compared to other EU nations.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_877" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_877" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_877" style="display:none;"></p>

Experts anticipate significant sector growth in 2022, with 61% of surveyed companies planning to increase their martech investments. This surge in investment and market growth is reflected in increased merger and acquisition activity. Martech encompasses tools and software for effective marketing, including communication, branding, data analytics, and social media management.<br><br>Key drivers include the shift towards data-centric marketing, amplified by the pandemic, which heightened the need to retain customers and expand market share. Marketing technologies are crucial for achieving marketing and sales strategies across all industries. A significant challenge is employee development to effectively utilize these technologies, necessitating a transformation in training towards digital, augmented reality, and online learning.<br><br>Companies recognize the inevitability of investing in smart technologies to maintain a competitive edge. This presents an opportunity for agencies to expand their services and offer comprehensive solutions. The market is also active in mergers and acquisitions, evidenced by Salesforce's acquisition of Slack and Intuit's purchase of Mailchimp. The martech sector, after rapid development, is entering a consolidation phase, with expectations of continued M&A activity and record investments from private equity and venture capital funds.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_879" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_879" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_879" style="display:none;"></p>

Moore Czech Republic notes that the most common errors involve requesting consent where it's not needed, affecting up to 60% of entities.<br><br>A frequent example is requiring employee consent for payroll and HR purposes, which Petr Štětka, a manager at Moore Advisory, deems unnecessary.

Štětka explains that schools often misunderstand which consents are legally required and which are unnecessarily collected, citing photographs as an example where not every image constitutes personal data. Schools also faced issues with personal data processing related to COVID testing.<br><br>Excessive consent is more common in the public sector. Štětka also highlights issues with consent for camera systems and e-shop purchases. He states that the misuse of data processing consent is most prevalent in public sector institutions, often due to a lack of knowledge.<br><br>While people usually report cases where their data is processed without consent, the Office for Personal Data Protection (ÚOOÚ) can impose fines up to 10 million CZK for such practices.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_882" style="display:none;">The Czech labor market needs to open to foreign workers and adopt systemic changes. Experts from Moore Czech Republic identify healthcare, IT, industry, logistics, and gastronomy as the most affected sectors. The departure of many Ukrainians due to conscription has created immediate labor shortages, particularly in industry. The Czech labor market was already struggling before the war, with significantly more job vacancies than job seekers since spring 2018.<br><br>The article suggests that while state financial support during the pandemic was necessary, its broad and overly generous nature has had negative medium-term consequences, contributing to inflation and further paralyzing the labor market. This labor shortage is now critical in key sectors. Rising consumer prices are fueling wage demands, with Czech wages growing at one of the fastest rates in the EU. This, combined with the labor shortage, forces companies to offer unprecedented benefits and incentives, pushing up personnel costs.<br><br>To address these issues, systemic changes are crucial. The Czech Republic should simplify the employment of foreign workers, making it easier for them to integrate into the workforce. This includes accelerated recognition of qualifications and work permits. Changes to labor laws, such as shortening notice periods, are also recommended to make the labor market more flexible for both hiring and dismissals. The influx of Ukrainian refugees, with a significant female demographic, presents an opportunity for sectors like light manufacturing, agriculture, and services.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_882" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_882" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_882" style="display:none;"></p>

By the end of 2021, 44% of Czech companies used cloud services, surpassing the European average. This surge is attributed to the pandemic, which accelerated remote work adoption, alongside financial savings and increased trust in IT. Companies are moving away from building their own IT infrastructure, benefiting from the flexibility and cost reductions offered by the cloud, particularly for email services.<br><br>However, cybersecurity experts warn that cloud and hybrid solutions, often implemented for home office work, increase the number of vulnerable access points, thus raising the risk of cyberattacks. The increased reliance on remote access from less secure home environments, coupled with potential security gaps in cloud providers' infrastructure, creates more opportunities for identity theft or data breaches. Despite these concerns, companies that prioritize cybersecurity and preventive measures can deflect up to 90% of potential attacks, highlighting the importance of robust security strategies in the cloud-first era.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_883" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_883" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_883" style="display:none;"></p>

Only a Quarter Focus on Systematic Prevention**<br><br>According to a survey, one in five companies faced a cyberattack, but only a quarter proactively address cybersecurity through audits and testing.

Two-thirds recognize the need for increased cybersecurity efforts, but many address issues reactively rather than proactively.<br><br>Martin Listopad from Moore Czech Republic emphasizes the growing risk of attacks that can compromise information and paralyze operations.

The survey found that only a third of companies that experienced a cyberattack in the past three years detected and eliminated it early.<br><br>Although half of the companies address cybersecurity at the management level and acknowledge that stronger protection requires higher investment, proactive investment is generally lower than the potential costs of dealing with an attack. Experts warn that despite widespread awareness, companies often have a lukewarm approach to security, with only a quarter using audits and testing for prevention. Proactive cybersecurity measures can prevent up to 90% of potential attacks. Audits help analyze risks, identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and implement measures to manage situations that could paralyze business operations. Audits also ensure compliance with legal regulations to avoid penalties related to contractual relationships and data protection.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_885" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_885" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_885" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_886" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>The number of cyberattacks has almost doubled. People working from home are the most vulnerable.<br><br>According to cybersecurity experts from Doxologic, attackers are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic situation, which has moved a large portion of employees to work from home, making their devices more easily vulnerable.<br><br>Doxologic, part of the Moore Czech Republic group, reports that not only public institutions but also private companies are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks. A weak point is the inadequate security of technology when working from home. "Endpoints such as laptops are the gateway to companies and are also the most frequent target of attacks. Through them, attackers can access entire corporate systems," warns Doxologic Director Martin Listopad.<br><br>"Devices directly in the company are usually protected by advanced technologies for the entire organization. Users are hidden behind imaginary ramparts. Unfortunately, many companies have failed to react and protect users who are not currently behind this imaginary rampart," describes Martin Listopad.<br><br>The basis of security is prevention.<br><br>It is important to protect oneself regularly and purposefully and to educate employees.<br><br>"The security policies of organizations should include regular security audits, updates of application versions, regular changes of strong access passwords, and the building of a quality security infrastructure, protecting organizations both against attacks on themselves and through their employees working in the field or from home," reminds Martin Listopad.<br><br>A new trend is so-called triple extortion.<br><br>A common type of attack is ransomware attacks, in which attackers encrypt the data of the affected subject and demand a ransom for decryption. This is the so-called double extortion technique, which was most evident in the case of the attack on Colonial Pipeline.<br><br>"A novelty and an increasingly common phenomenon in 2021 is the technique of triple extortion," states Martin Listopad, adding: "In addition to stealing sensitive data, attackers also target the customers of organizations or their business partners, from whom they also demand a ransom."<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Cyberattacks have surged, particularly targeting employees working from home due to vulnerabilities in their devices and inadequate security measures implemented by companies. Private firms and public institutions alike are facing increased threats, with laptops serving as frequent entry points for attackers. Experts emphasize the importance of prevention through regular security audits, application updates, strong passwords, and robust security infrastructure to protect organizations and remote workers. A concerning trend is the rise of triple extortion, where attackers not only encrypt and steal data but also target customers and business partners, demanding ransoms from all involved.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_887" style="display:none;">The Czech Republic will not meet the deadline to approve legislation protecting whistleblowers, who report illegal activities within organizations. Experts say stronger protection could encourage more reporting, shielding individuals from retaliation. Despite the delay, some entities, especially those acting as the "state" like state institutions, local governments, and entities providing public services, may face immediate obligations from the EU Whistleblowing Directive starting December 17, 2021.<br><br>The upcoming legislation will impose duties on employers with at least 25 employees, municipalities with over 5,000 inhabitants, public procurers, and other selected entities, including implementing internal reporting systems and designating individuals to investigate reports. The aim is to create a safe environment, encouraging internal reporting over public disclosure. Retaliation against whistleblowers, like job termination or discrimination, is a concern. Some organizations are proactively preparing for the new rules.<br><br>Failure to comply with the new requirements can result in fines up to one million Czech crowns or 5% of annual turnover. The designated person in charge can be fined up to 100,000 crowns. Furthermore, companies risk reputational damage and potential disclosure of trade secrets if reports are not addressed properly. Whistleblowers are mainly employees reporting wrongdoing witnessed at work, but the law extends to self-employed individuals, members of legal entities' bodies, trainees, suppliers, and job applicants.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_887" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_887" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_887" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_888" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>Many organizations still haven't properly addressed GDPR compliance. The most common mistake is requiring unnecessary consent.<br><br>Despite the difficulty in quantifying them, experts at Moore Czech Republic, which manages personal data for nearly 300 organizations, warn that many face sanctions. The GDPR regulation has been accompanied by many concerns from the outset, causing unnecessary errors that increase the administrative burden.<br><br>Three years after its effective date, many uncertainties still surround GDPR. According to experts at Moore Czech Republic, data processing affects countless fields, and many entities still frequently make mistakes in complying with the legislation. Common errors include processing excessive data, unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and sending unsolicited commercial communications.<br><br>According to Petr Štětka, Manager at Moore Advisory, intentional breaches of personal data security are rare. However, even unintentional violations like data loss or accidental destruction can lead to sanctions, even if all other processes are correctly set up. By April 30, 2021, the Office for Personal Data Protection (ÚOOÚ) received 1065 notifications of serious breaches in personal data processing obligations. However, only 12 fines were issued, totaling over half a million Czech crowns, with the largest fine being 180,000 crowns.<br><br>Besides unintentional oversights, Moore Czech Republic points to gross violations like unmarked camera systems, insufficient information about personal data processing, and excessive consent requests. Many organizations require consent where it's unnecessary, adding administrative burden for themselves and clients. A typical example is human resources and consent for processing personal data for payroll and personnel purposes, where processing is already mandated by law.<br><br>Website and e-shop operators have made the most progress in personal data protection in recent years. However, many still aren't oriented in the current legislation, leading to errors. For example, a COVID-19 testing site used an outdated law in its privacy form, signaling a lack of proper GDPR implementation. Such shortcomings can be easily rectified by collaborating with GDPR experts.<br><br>Experts attribute the current situation partly to a lack of attention and communication from the state. GDPR was approved in April 2016 and came into effect in May 2018, giving ample time for awareness. The inadequate information campaign led to unnecessary panic among data processors and the public. The delayed approval of the Czech adaptation law nearly a year after GDPR's effective date added to the uncertainty. This uncertainty and fear-mongering led to an exaggerated perception that even simple actions like introductions would require consent.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Many organizations still struggle with GDPR compliance three years after its implementation, facing potential sanctions. Common errors include excessive data processing, unauthorized disclosure, unsolicited communication, and requiring unnecessary consent, often stemming from uncertainty and misinterpretation of the regulations. The Office for Personal Data Protection has received numerous breach notifications, but issued relatively few fines. While website and e-shop operators have made progress, many businesses still rely on outdated legal frameworks. Experts blame inadequate state communication, delayed adaptation law, and fear-mongering for the widespread confusion and panic. Organizations can easily improve GDPR compliance through cooperation with GDPR experts. Unnecessary bureaucracy has been the result of the misconception of GDPR regulations, causing a lot of confusion.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_888" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_888" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_888" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_889" style="display:none;">Government investment in research and development (R&D) has significantly increased in the Czech Republic, but the country still lags behind the EU average. In 2020, the Czech Republic invested 128 euros per capita, falling short of the EU average. Experts at Moore Czech Republic emphasize the importance of maintaining this funding trend to transform the Czech economy into a high-value-added, advanced economy.<br><br>In 2020, total government R&D spending in the EU surpassed 100 million euros, a 22% increase compared to 2010. Czech government R&D spending has increased by 42.7 euros per capita in the last decade; despite this 50% growth, the Czech Republic ranks 15th among EU member states. Experts highlight that R&D investment is critical for the Czech Republic's economic transformation, particularly during the post-pandemic recovery. Government R&D investments also stimulate private investment.<br><br>Private R&D investment in the Czech Republic is also below average. Almost 60% of companies reduced their science and research budgets. The absence of incentives for businesses to invest is a major factor. Experts suggest adjusting the National Recovery Plan to support private sector investment and collaboration with universities, potentially through tax breaks, project funding, and other forms of cooperation. The Czech Republic is the leader in R&D investment among the Visegrad Four countries, but still behind compared to Scandinavian countries, Austria, and Germany.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_889" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_889" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_889" style="display:none;"></p>

Supporting at least voluntary registration is an option.<br><br>According to experts from Moore Czech Republic, the state would voluntarily cut off a tool for easy allocation of subsidies based on recorded revenue and lose the ability to monitor the economy in various business sectors and regions. Given the significant investments made by businesses, the established public administration apparatus, progress in digitization, and other benefits of EET, it should be preserved, at least on a voluntary basis through a minor amendment to the law.<br><br>Political infighting has placed the forming government coalition in a difficult position. Abolishing EET would mean the future government is consciously giving up a tool that could help restart tax collection from small and medium-sized businesses and could be used as a platform for issuing electronic receipts.<br><br>Introducing EET in the 3rd and 4th waves would help modernize the POS systems of this group of entrepreneurs, including adding payment card acceptance. The support of POS system modernization and non-cash payment terminals is currently an initiative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Czech Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>If the new government doesn't want to force entrepreneurs to use EET, the system can be made voluntary. Honest entrepreneurs want to pay taxes and don't want to be forced into the grey economy by unfair competition. The state could reward them with easier access to incentives and subsidies or better conditions for investments in digitalization.<br><br>Re-starting revenue recording in a voluntary mode, coupled with a set of advantages and incentives for entrepreneurs, can be a positive signal, which the new government could declare both the effort to manage and improve the economy, and to solve the country's debt. Voluntary EET for the 3rd and 4th wave can be introduced almost immediately with a minor amendment to the EET law. The law is already drafted, and its implementation depends on the will of the future political representatives.<br><br>EET was introduced in the Czech Republic at the end of 2016 with the intention of better tax collection by registering cash payments, eliminating the grey economy and leveling the competitive playing field.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Experts argue against completely abolishing the Electronic Records of Sales (EET), suggesting a voluntary system. Abolishing EET would hinder tax collection, economic monitoring, and the modernization of payment systems, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. A voluntary EET (DEET) would allow honest entrepreneurs to comply while receiving benefits like easier access to subsidies and digitalization investments. This approach signals a positive change, promoting economic health and rewarding compliance. A simple amendment to the existing law could implement voluntary EET quickly, offering a less repressive and more supportive environment for businesses. This also furthers the digitalization of the economy and streamlines business-government communication. Introduced in 2016, EET aimed to improve tax collection and reduce the grey economy.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_890" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_890" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_890" style="display:none;"></p>

Across the EU, men dominate the ICT sector, accounting for 83% of the workforce, a 3% increase since 2010. Despite various initiatives promoting women in ICT in the Czech Republic, the gender imbalance persists. Between 2010 and 2020, the percentage of female ICT students in the Czech Republic rose from 11.5% to 17%. Experts emphasize that increased female participation is crucial to address labor shortages in the well-compensated ICT sector and could help reduce the gender pay gap. Although the Czech Republic shows improvement, it still lags behind other EU nations, with Denmark leading with a 33% female representation in ICT.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_891" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_891" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_891" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_892" style="display:none;">Call-offs, reflecting current part needs, are haunting automotive subcontractors, potentially leading to existential crises within three months. Industrial production in the Czech Republic decreased in August, with the automotive sector falling by over 28%. Moore Czech Republic forecasts this may last 3-4 months before some subcontractors face significant problems, with normalization expected no sooner than late in the first half of next year.<br><br>Chip supply lead times have lengthened to 21 weeks, the longest since 2017. Experts estimate the chip crisis will cost automakers over 4 trillion Czech crowns in lost revenue. Order cancellations are impacting the entire supply chain which operates on a "just in time" principle. Subcontractors heavily reliant on the automotive sector face the most severe issues, prompting them to diversify their customer base. Shifting to other sectors is challenging financially, technically, and logistically. Some manufacturers are temporarily using employer-side obstacles to reduce costs, though this must be done carefully to avoid employee attrition in a competitive labor market. Possible solutions include delivering cars with temporarily unavailable non-essential features.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_892" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_892" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_892" style="display:none;"></p>

This optimism stems from the summer's receding epidemic and confidence in vaccination, with some firms incentivizing employees to get vaccinated.<br><br>Companies have adapted to existing restrictions and believe they won't be tightened. The Czech Chamber of Commerce supports this outlook, stating that widespread or sectoral restrictions are unlikely given the availability of vaccination. They advocate for timely issue resolution without significant service disruption.<br><br>While 66% of companies are not proactively implementing additional measures, a third are preparing them.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_895" style="display:none;">Subpar GDP Growth in the Second Quarter. Czech Economy Recovers Slower Than Most EU Countries.<br><br>Radim Darebník<br><br>August 23, 2021<br><br>This is not an isolated fluctuation; the Czech Republic has recorded worse growth or a decline compared to the EU average for four consecutive quarters. This is according to an analysis of current Eurostat data conducted by the consulting firm Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>Not only the European Union as a whole but also the Czech Republic returned to economic growth in the second quarter.<br><br>"An annual quarterly growth of 7.8% is significant at first glance, but it's important to realize that last year's second quarter base was significantly impacted by the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. However, this was the case in practically all European countries, of which the Czech Republic showed the second-lowest pace of economic recovery in the last three months," points out Petr Kymlička, partner at Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>The European Union recorded an average year-on-year growth of 13.2% during the same period, with ten countries even showing double-digit growth.<br><br>"The Czech Republic has shown worse economic development than the EU average since the third quarter of 2020. In the second quarter, there was the aforementioned slower growth, and in the previous three quarters, a more significant year-on-year quarterly decline," notes Petr Kymlička, adding that the Eurostat data is not yet complete, as figures from 7 EU member states are missing. The Czech economy also showed a lower growth rate than the EU average (1.9%) in a quarter-on-quarter comparison, growing by only 0.6%, making it the fourth slowest.<br><br>According to the Moore Czech Republic analysis, the cause of this development can be seen primarily in the differentiated impacts of the coronavirus crisis and the methods of its resolution. The significant dependence of the domestic economy on the automotive industry, which is affected by a fundamental disruption of supply chains, combined with rising input prices and a long-term labor shortage, is slowing down its growth pace.<br><br>The Czech Republic's economic recovery in the second quarter of 2021, while showing a 7.8% year-on-year growth, lagged significantly behind the EU average of 13.2%. This underperformance has been consistent for four consecutive quarters, with the Czech Republic exhibiting the second-lowest recovery rate among European nations. The analysis highlights that this slower growth is attributable to the uneven impacts of the pandemic and the country's economic structure. A key factor is the Czech economy's heavy reliance on the automotive sector, which is currently struggling with disrupted supply chains. Furthermore, rising input costs and a persistent shortage of labor are hindering its ability to rebound effectively compared to its EU peers. The Eurostat data, while incomplete for some member states, supports this trend, indicating a persistent lag in the Czech Republic's economic performance.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_895" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_895" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_895" style="display:none;"></p>

However, experts from Moore Czech Republic believe that Czech industry is not yet operating at its full potential, primarily due to a lack of skilled labor and essential materials.<br><br>According to the latest Eurostat data, industrial production in the Czech Republic rose by 1% month-on-month in June 2021. Malta recorded the most significant growth (+5.2%), followed by Slovakia (+2.9%).

The Czech Republic outperformed this average with an 11.4% growth. Petr Kymlička of Moore Czech Republic commented that European countries are slowly returning to pre-pandemic levels of industrial production, including Czech companies. Despite supply chain disruptions affecting certain sectors, a persistent Czech characteristic hampering nearly all manufacturing companies is the shortage of workers.<br><br>Kymlička added that despite these obstacles, domestic industry achieved double-digit year-on-year growth in June, a feat not all EU states managed, with 11 countries, particularly Nordic nations, reporting only single-digit percentage growth.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_896" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_896" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_896" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_897" style="display:none;">The Czech Republic experienced the second-highest growth in public debt as a percentage of GDP among EU member states in the first quarter of 2021, increasing from 37.8% to 44.1%. This surge, second only to Cyprus, was primarily attributed to the uncontrolled COVID-19 pandemic and the associated increased expenditures on combating it, along with restrictive measures that hampered economic activity. Petr Kymlička of Moore Czech Republic highlighted that the pandemic's peak in the Czech Republic was a major driver of this over-average debt increase.<br><br>While many EU countries saw their debt rise, Slovakia managed to maintain its debt level at 60.3% of GDP. Kymlička also pointed out that the decline in state revenues, partly due to the abolition of the super-gross wage, and upcoming elections, which typically hinder debt reduction efforts, contributed to the Czech Republic's debt growth. Despite this quarterly increase, the Czech Republic remains among the countries with the lowest overall debt. However, without systemic budget consolidation, the country is likely to climb higher in the rankings of most indebted nations, as evidenced by Lithuania and Denmark reducing their debt-to-GDP ratios during the same period.<br><br>The Czech Republic's public debt rose significantly in the first quarter of 2021, reaching 44.1% of GDP, marking the second-highest quarterly increase in the EU after Cyprus. This surge was largely driven by increased spending to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and economic restrictions. Petr Kymlička of Moore Czech Republic cited the pandemic's peak in the Czech Republic as the primary reason for this over-average debt growth. He also noted that a decline in state revenues, linked to the abolition of the super-gross wage, and the upcoming elections contribute to the debt situation. While Slovakia maintained its debt levels, the Czech Republic's substantial increase means it could face higher rankings in indebted countries if budget consolidation is not prioritized. Despite this, the Czech Republic still ranks among the EU countries with the lowest overall debt.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_897" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_897" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_897" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_898" style="display:none;">Mortgage prices continue to rise. Czechia is approaching the top ten EU countries with the highest average rates.<br><br>Radim Darebník<br>July 27, 2021<br><br>Czechia is likely to soon rank among the ten EU countries with the most expensive mortgages. Latvia, Hungary, and Romania lead with rates above 4%. Conversely, eurozone countries primarily have rates more than twice as low, often around 1%. Finns borrow for housing most cheaply with an interest rate of 0.8%.<br><br>While mortgage rates hit historic lows last year, this year is marked by their increase. Czech mortgage interest rates, averaging 2.42%, are among the more expensive within the European Union.<br><br>"Considering the Czech National Bank's further increase in its repo rate, it can be expected that this growth will continue," states Marcela Hrdá, partner at Moore Czech Republic. Currently, the Czech Republic ranks 11th among 27 EU states in terms of average mortgage rates, just 0.09 percentage points behind the Netherlands.<br><br>"Mortgage prices at Dutch banks have been falling in recent months, so Czechia will very likely join the ten countries with the highest rates," adds Marcela Hrdá.<br><br>Slovakia has one of the lowest rates. According to data from theglobaleconomy.com, Latvia (5%), Hungary (4.4%), and Romania (4.39%) have the most expensive mortgage interest rates. In contrast, Finland (0.80%), Portugal (1.00%), and neighboring Slovakia (1.09%) have the lowest mortgage rates. All of Czechia's neighboring countries also have lower average rates. "The comparison clearly shows that, with few exceptions, eurozone countries have low rates. Competition in the mortgage market is also an important factor," concludes Marcela Hrdá, noting that due to rising mortgage prices, homeownership is becoming even less affordable for Czechs, despite its significant popularity.<br><br>Summary:<br>Czechia's average mortgage interest rates are rising, placing it close to the top ten most expensive in the EU. Currently at 2.42%, this figure is expected to climb further due to anticipated increases in the Czech National Bank's repo rate. This trend contrasts with the historically low rates seen last year and positions Czechia behind only nine other EU nations, with the Netherlands being just slightly ahead. Countries like Latvia, Hungary, and Romania have significantly higher rates, while eurozone nations, particularly Finland, Portugal, and Slovakia, offer substantially lower rates. This increase in mortgage costs is making homeownership, a highly valued aspiration in Czechia, increasingly out of reach for its citizens.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_898" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_898" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_898" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_899" style="display:none;">The end of the Antivirus program did not lead to increased unemployment; instead, it helped preserve around 100,000 jobs. Experts from Moore Czech Republic found that the termination of two phases of the Antivirus program in late May had minimal impact on unemployment statistics. Despite pessimistic forecasts of layoffs and rising unemployment following the discontinuation of government subsidies for closed businesses and reduced production, these fears did not materialize.<br><br>Radovan Hauk, a partner at Moore Czech Republic, stated that the Antivirus program successfully maintained low unemployment at the cost of a significant increase in public debt. While some companies did conduct layoffs, the overall impact on national unemployment was negligible. Calculations by Moore Czech Republic indicated that without these programs, unemployment would have been 1.2 percentage points higher at the beginning of the year, exceeding 5%. The programs supported approximately 100,000 employees, positively influencing household consumption, a key component of GDP. This suggests that companies that utilized the Antivirus program have seen a recovery in orders and sufficient employment opportunities for their staff. Furthermore, many previously laid-off workers have found new jobs.<br><br>Instead of rising unemployment, the Czech economy now faces a labor shortage, particularly in sectors like industry, IT, and the gastronomy sector, where workers are reluctant to return due to uncertain futures. This shortage persists across various segments, despite a significant number of job seekers registered with the labor office. A contributing factor is the low willingness of individuals to seek employment in different fields. The introduction of modular retraining mechanisms aims to address this by recognizing existing skills and providing targeted training, enabling a more efficient transition to new roles.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_899" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_899" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_899" style="display:none;"></p>

In contrast, within the scope of exceeding measures, the Czech Republic released only 5.4% of GDP, with only Slovakia spending less at 4.4% of GDP. This is according to a comparative analysis by the consulting company Moore Czech Republic, based on International Monetary Fund (IMF) data.<br><br>Per capita, Poland (CZK 25,577) and Slovakia (CZK 20,062) spent less than the Czech Republic in the fight against COVID-19.

The Czech Republic was significantly more active than other Visegrad Four countries in utilizing instruments like guarantees and warranties, channeling 15.4% of GDP into the economy this way, compared to around 4% in Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia. Direct economic support across all V4 countries primarily focused on wage compensation, sick pay, rent support, business income compensation, and tax deferrals. Poland and Hungary provided the highest support to non-healthcare sectors (7.4% and 6.4% of GDP respectively), while the Czech Republic and Slovakia provided the least (4.2% of GDP).

Experts from Moore Legal CZ anticipate that this automatic provisioning will substantially impact not only how authorities deliver documents but may also impose an obligation to file submissions with authorities via the data box.<br><br>Effective January 1, 2023, data boxes will be automatically established for:<br>*   All legal entities registered in the Register of Persons, encompassing not just those in the Commercial Register but also those in the Register of Associations, Foundations, Institutes, Unit Owners' Associations, and Public Benefit Companies.<br>*   All self-employed individuals, lawyers, statutory auditors, tax advisors, insolvency administrators, experts, court interpreters, and court translators. Previously, self-employed individuals only received data boxes upon request; now, the Ministry of the Interior will issue them automatically.<br>*   All legally competent individuals registered in the Basic Population Register who use a means of electronic identification from a qualified electronic identification system.

These individuals can request to deactivate their data box.<br><br>A crucial aspect will be thorough public awareness to ensure new data box holders are informed about document deliveries, such as administrative decisions, to avoid missing deadlines.<br><br>Another key legislative change unifies the delivery moment for private and public law documents. Delivery will occur when the authorized person logs into their data box. If the person does not log in regularly, a deemed delivery occurs 10 days after the document is placed in the data box. This aims to streamline document delivery, eliminating the need to differentiate between private and public law documents, which is considered a positive step.<br><br>Summary:<br>Starting January 1, 2023, more Czech legal entities and self-employed individuals will automatically receive a data box, eliminating the need for applications. This expansion includes various types of legal entities beyond those in the Commercial Register, as well as professions like lawyers, auditors, and tax advisors. Self-employed individuals will also receive them automatically. Furthermore, legally competent individuals using qualified electronic identification methods will be provided with a data box, though they can opt out. A significant change is the unification of document delivery for both private and public law documents; delivery is confirmed upon login to the data box, with a 10-day deeming period for non-frequent users. The goal is to prevent delivery obstruction and ensure timely processing of official communications.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_902" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_902" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_902" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_903" style="display:none;">Moore Czech Republic strengthens its cybersecurity capabilities with the acquisition of Menzo Security. The Menzo Security division, established in December 2016, became part of DoxoLogic, with Moore Czech Republic holding a 60% stake. Its primary mission is to advise clients on data and information system protection measures and to provide proactive, cost-effective monitoring of cyberattacks.<br><br>Miloslav Rut, Director of Moore Technology CZ, highlighted Menzo Security's quality services and ability to implement advanced technologies against cyber threats as key factors for their investment. Menzo Security has successfully deployed leading security technologies from Check Point and Trend Micro, assessing and improving security for over 250 clients, ranging from small businesses to large banking and state organizations.<br><br>A significant achievement for Menzo is the development and operation of its proprietary Security Insight product, a security monitoring service that detects attacks early to prevent substantial damage. Martin Listopad, Director of DoxoLogic, mentioned that Security Insight has undergone significant improvements and will soon be unveiled under the Moore brand, offering enhanced security for organizations with extensive systems and on-premise infrastructure needs.<br><br>This acquisition reinforces Moore Czech Republic's comprehensive service offering and aligns with Moore Technology CZ's development strategy, particularly in light of the planned entry of a strategic investor into its subsidiary Servodata. Rut emphasized that Moore is increasingly covering crucial areas for its clients, including cybersecurity, robotic data processing, business process digitalization, and the utilization of artificial intelligence, all identified as dominant areas in future technological development.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_903" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_903" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_903" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_906" style="display:none;">A new law regarding the register of beneficial owners comes into effect in June, potentially imposing sanctions on businesses. Moore Legal CZ highlights that unlike previous regulations, the new law introduces penalties for failing to register beneficial owner information.<br><br>The obligation to register applies to legal entities and trusts. A significant change is the requirement for beneficial owners of corporations to be natural persons. Complex ownership structures must trace the beneficial owner to the ultimate natural person. If this identification is impossible, individuals in top management, such as board members, will be registered as beneficial owners. The law also introduces an "automatic registration" for companies with simple ownership structures, especially when the beneficial owner is evident from the commercial register.<br><br>A beneficial owner is defined as any natural person who is the ultimate beneficiary or has ultimate control, either directly or indirectly. This includes individuals who could receive a substantial portion of the entity's profits or those who can exert decisive influence.<br><br>For corporations, this includes individuals entitled to over 25% of the profit, assets, or liquidation balance, or those holding a significant share of voting rights exceeding 25%. Failure to register can result in fines of up to 500,000 CZK for individuals, prohibition of profit distribution, or restriction of voting rights in the company's highest governing body. The new law is taken seriously and should be handled with urgency. A portion of the beneficial owner register will also be publicly accessible through the Ministry of Justice's website.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_906" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_906" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_906" style="display:none;"></p>

Companies also see benefits in it, but are not yet considering its implementation. Nearly four out of ten people currently work more than 40 hours a week. A survey conducted by Ipsos for Moore Czech Republic revealed that two-thirds of managers of small and medium-sized companies are also positive about the idea. However, one-fifth of managers believe that such a move would be detrimental to companies.<br><br>The proposed shortened work week would involve limiting work to four days, reducing working hours from 40 to 35. Sixty percent of Czechs would like this, even if it meant working more intensely during those four days. However, over a fifth would not welcome a shorter work week, preferring to spread their work over five days for a calmer pace.<br><br>Almost two-thirds of managers believe it would increase productivity and employee satisfaction. Conversely, over a fifth believe it would harm companies, reducing work output and performance. Only thirteen percent of managers are considering implementing a shortened work week in the next five years; a quarter reject the idea, and half are unsure. One-fifth believe all weekly work duties could be completed in four days without increased daily productivity. One-third believe it would only be possible with increased productivity. Sixteen percent of managers say even five days are not enough.<br><br>In Europe, a maximum 40-hour work week is most common. The longest working hours are in Liechtenstein and Switzerland (up to 50 hours), while the shortest are in France, Denmark, and Belgium (38 hours).

Most Czechs surveyed, and a two-thirds of managers believed it would increase productivity and employee satisfaction.

A significant portion of managers believes increased daily productivity would be necessary to make a four-day work week viable. Some believe that five days are needed to complete the work. The study also points out that implementing a four-day work week might not be suitable for all industries, especially those requiring constant employee availability. The 40-hour week remains the most common in Europe, with shorter and longer averages existing in specific countries.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_908" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_908" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_908" style="display:none;"></p>

On the other hand, companies involved in technology development or industrial automation will be in a stronger position vis-à-vis investors. Generational change in family businesses, which began in our region approximately five years ago, may also increase the number of transactions.<br><br>According to the consulting company Moore Czech Republic, the pandemic favors large players in the market in terms of transaction activity, especially in gastronomy and tourism, i.e. in areas that have been most affected by anti-epidemic measures.<br><br>"Investors who have sufficient capital will be able to acquire these assets at lower prices, consolidate them and build larger units. We therefore expect transaction activity in these sectors to increase by a lower tens of percent this year compared to last year," says Petr Kymlička, partner at Moore Czech Republic.<br><br>The price of technology companies will increase<br><br>The past period, on the other hand, strengthened companies that deal with industrial automation, the development of technologies for complex remote work, or virtual and augmented reality. This makes it possible, for example, to introduce highly efficient remote repair and maintenance processes.<br><br>"It can be expected that companies from these fields will be in demand on the market and demand for them will increase. They will therefore be traded at higher prices than in the previous period. These companies are aware of the lack of human resources, which they are replacing with their technologies. The mentioned effect was exacerbated by the pandemic, especially in industrial enterprises, where a large part of foreign workers ceased to be available," explains Petr Kymlička.<br><br>According to Moore Czech Republic, there will also be an intensification of generational change in the ownership of family businesses in the coming years. This process began to appear more significantly among Czech companies in the last five years, and should gain momentum this year and next year.<br><br>"The current situation will strengthen the motivation of the current generation of owners to hand over companies to the younger generation. The latter, on the other hand, will show greater reluctance and fear of taking over companies on their own responsibility," adds Václav Škapa, partner of the company and expert in transaction consulting. For these reasons, according to him, the role of foreign strategic investors, whose aim is to strengthen their position in the region, could strengthen on the Czech market.<br><br>The second half of the year in the sign of growth<br><br>According to Moore Czech Republic, the growth of transaction activities will be reflected only in the second half of the year. There will also be a "restart" of transactions that were delayed or interrupted last year.<br><br>"Despite significant restrictions in 2020, we managed to complete twenty medium-sized transactions across various segments of the economy, especially in industry and technology. The number of active mandates increased by fifteen percent year-on-year," says Václav Škapa. A factor that could slow down mergers and acquisitions, on the other hand, are differences in price expectations.<br><br>"While sellers will tend to base their expectations on performance in times of growth, buyers will take into account risk factors in valuations that they did not take into account a year ago. Overall, however, we see 2021 as very promising from the point of view of transaction consulting," adds Petr Kymlička.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Moore Czech Republic anticipates increased transactional activity in sectors heavily impacted by the pandemic, such as gastronomy and tourism, as larger companies capitalize on distressed assets. Conversely, technology and industrial automation firms will command higher prices due to increased demand fueled by labor shortages and the need for remote solutions. A generational shift in family business ownership, already underway, is expected to accelerate, potentially driving more foreign strategic investment as younger generations express reluctance to take over. While differing price expectations between buyers and sellers may pose a hurdle, the overall outlook for transactional consulting in 2021 is positive, particularly in the latter half of the year, as delayed transactions resume and activity increases in industry and technology.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_910" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_910" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_910" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_911" style="display:none;">Asian economies are outpacing Europe in economic growth due to their faster recovery from the pandemic. China's economy, for example, rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in the last quarter of 2020, while the EU economy contracted by 6.4% in the same year. China's GDP grew by 2.3% in 2020, exceeding 100 trillion yuan. The EU economy, however, shrank by 6.4%, with Spain, Italy, and France experiencing the largest declines. The Czech Republic fared better with a 5.6% decrease.<br><br>Asian economies are benefiting from China's stable supply chain and are not hindered by the strict restrictions seen in Europe. Japan and South Korea are also experiencing economic growth. While Japan's GDP declined in the first half of 2020, it rebounded in the third and fourth quarters. South Korea also saw growth in the latter half of the year, nearly returning to pre-pandemic levels. China's import and export values increased by 1.6% year-on-year. However, the tourism sector is weakening across Asia. While China's PMI was lower than the EU's at the end of the year, retail sales increased, and unemployment stabilized, with 12 million new jobs created.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_911" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_911" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_911" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_912" style="display:none;">Compensation for training companies in COVID programs does not match actual losses, threatening the closure of hundreds of them, which will slow down the economic restart.<br><br>The primary issue is that financial support is only granted for months when operations were mandatorily suspended. According to Moore Czech Republic, compensation should reflect real costs, irrespective of employee numbers or closure periods. They estimate hundreds of training facilities are at risk of closure due to financial difficulties, which will impede economic recovery.<br><br>Training centers lost most of their income last year due to extraordinary measures, affecting their spring and autumn peak seasons. While government restrictions limited or banned their activities, educational companies could operate during summer months, typically a period of low revenue. This timing is considered incorrect by experts like Radovan Hauk, who argues compensation should be based on proven revenue drops or fixed costs, as seen in other countries, not just formal closures.<br><br>Postponed courses led to additional expenses. Due to the pandemic, demand for courses was even lower in the summer, with people prioritizing holidays and fearing infection. Companies rescheduled courses for autumn to partially offset losses, but training was again significantly restricted or banned. Michaela Jankulárová from S-COMP highlights that course planning takes weeks, meaning businesses incurred extra costs from last-minute cancellations.<br><br>A further problem with the COVID Gastro program's compensation, specifically for closed establishments, is the focus on employee numbers. This metric often doesn't align with actual fixed operational costs. Training companies typically have low internal staff numbers, with the most significant fixed costs being rent for training spaces. Hauk notes that if training were categorized alongside events like congresses, recognized support days would be 76, while companies were effectively unable to operate for almost three-quarters of the year.<br><br>Moore Czech Republic estimates government compensation covers only 40-50% of last year's economic losses. Many are small entities that have exhausted their reserves and cannot secure bank financing, leading to the potential closure of hundreds of businesses. These companies are crucial for economic restart, providing retraining necessary due to rising unemployment. A shortage of training capacity could therefore significantly slow the Czech economic recovery.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_912" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_912" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_912" style="display:none;"></p>

Although December saw an 8.7% increase in new car sales year-on-year, January 2021 witnessed a sharp 18.8% decline, continuing the downturn from the previous autumn.<br><br>A potential improvement in the epidemic situation, combined with vaccination efforts, might not be significantly felt until mid-year. Experts predict production volumes in the Czech Republic to either stagnate or decline by an additional five to seven percent in 2021.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_916" style="display:none;">Only about a tenth of Prague's sports facilities are accessible, and a new sports development plan aims to improve the situation. A survey by the Prague City Hall revealed that almost a third of sports facility operators believe their venues are accessible. However, an analysis of facility records shows that only 9.6% are actually accessible, and even fewer are truly suitable for disabled athletes, often only allowing for passive participation.<br><br>The analysis highlighted several barriers faced by disabled athletes, including unsuitable field dimensions, poor surface quality, lack of accessible restrooms, and inadequate changing rooms. In response, the city, which owns 104 sports facilities, is preparing a new development plan to increase accessibility for disabled individuals. This plan emphasizes the construction of new, truly accessible facilities and greater involvement of organizations representing disabled athletes in assessing accessibility solutions.<br><br>The city council for sports stated the goal is to increase accessibility by building new venues and better involving disabled sports organizations in evaluating accessible solutions. Physical activity offers significant physical, mental, and social health benefits for people with disabilities, improving independence and quality of life. However, mere accessibility to a venue doesn't guarantee suitability for sports activities; proper social facilities are crucial for dignified participation.<br><br>To prepare the new strategy, Prague conducted surveys and held working group meetings involving various stakeholders, including organizations for disabled athletes, to address limited accessibility. It was noted that this is a systemic issue across the Czech Republic, with a lack of strict adherence to regulations concerning accessibility for all disabilities.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_916" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_916" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_916" style="display:none;"></p>

Created by the Czech Electronic Sport Association (CESA), comprising players, teams, and organizers, the petition argues that esports' growing global popularity warrants its recognition as an official leisure activity beneficial for both mental and physical well-being. This recognition would allow esports clubs and organizations to receive state support, mirroring that provided to other sports. Germany serves as a precedent, where esports clubs have achieved non-profit status, clarifying tax and donation frameworks and opening avenues for financial backing. The petition, addressed to the Czech government and National Sports Agency, highlights the discipline, strategic thinking, and skills required of esports players and seeks measures to equalize their standing with other sports. It has garnered support from hundreds of gaming community representatives and major international corporations. Esports' increasing professionalization, official tournaments, and marketing potential are attracting fans and sponsors. Experts believe that equalizing esports with traditional sports is crucial for its development in the Czech Republic, enabling it to remain competitive in this rapidly expanding sector.

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_923" style="display:none;">**Translation:**<br><br>The pandemic highlighted the need to prepare government officials for remote work. Equipment, security, and training will cost tens of billions. The pandemic accelerated the shift to online operations for many companies, prompting them to adopt mandatory or recommended "home office" policies. However, the transition to remote work for civil servants was often complicated or even impossible.<br><br>Changing operational models is easier in the private sector than in public administration. Companies can relatively easily replace or modify their IT systems and infrastructure or change their processes. In the public sector, such changes are more complex due to technical limitations, information security requirements, and the inability to react quickly to infrastructure adjustments.<br><br>Documents often cannot leave government buildings, and legislation for remote work is still not fully defined. While the public administration has been working on digitization for several years, the emergency situation revealed that offices are not fully prepared for remote work. The pandemic has accelerated plans to strengthen both cybersecurity and infrastructure to meet future needs.<br><br>Besides security enhancements, public administration workers need adequate equipment and training for remote access. The state had considered these measures previously, but cybersecurity was not a priority. Massively strengthening information and communication technologies in the public sector will require significant investments in technology and human resources. Failure to prioritize this area could lead to significant damage from cybercrime. The transition to a virtual office concept will take several years.<br><br>In addition to technology and remote work procedures, the state sphere lacks modern, single-purpose administrative applications for efficient automation of administrative processes. Modernizing and automating internal processes to enable full remote operation during similar disruptions will take several years, including legislative changes, supplier selection, and implementation.<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the unpreparedness of the Czech public administration for remote work, unlike the private sector which adapted relatively easily. Civil servants faced challenges due to outdated IT infrastructure, security concerns, legislative gaps, and the inability to access physical documents. Addressing this requires significant investments, estimated at tens of billions, in cybersecurity, equipment, and training to enable secure and efficient remote access for government employees. Modernization also necessitates developing single-purpose administrative applications for process automation. ICT union stated that transitioning to a fully functional virtual office concept will be a multi-year endeavor, requiring legislative adjustments, vendor selection, and implementation. Prioritizing these improvements is crucial to prevent future disruptions and minimize potential damage from cybercrime, ensuring the public sector can operate effectively in emergencies.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_923" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_923" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_923" style="display:none;"></p>

Companies are also frequently using unsecured communication applications like Zoom. Home environments pose cybersecurity risks, often formally preventing work with sensitive data or confidential conference calls.<br><br>The shift to remote work in early March impacted many Czech employees. Moore Czech Republic's analysis revealed a 10% productivity drop in March, with a further decline to an average of one-third less efficiency in April compared to normal operations. This decline is attributed to entire teams being moved to home office regardless of suitability for remote work.<br><br>Cybersecurity risks at home are significant, with many employees lacking suitable secure remote work programs. Home environments increase the risk of sensitive data compromise. Commonly used communication programs are vulnerable, and while secure alternatives exist, their implementation is operationally challenging. Insufficiently secured home Wi-Fi is also a risk.<br><br>Adapting corporate culture to remote work takes years. Some employees, particularly in public administration, cannot work from home due to limitations on taking company laptops or using desktop computers, or because they cannot remove official documents from the office. Effective home office requires established processes for unexpected events like the current pandemic. While home office can work short-term, it is often unsustainable long-term.

This approach is bringing the Czech Republic closer to Western states, with experts predicting convergence in the structure and use of bonds within seven to ten years.<br><br>The Czech corporate bond market saw a significant shift in 2016, with the number of securities jumping from under four thousand to over 13 thousand. By late 2019, this figure had doubled. Companies, particularly those previously rejected by banks for loans due to short operating history or lack of collateral, have embraced bond financing. Banks are tightening lending conditions, making it harder for businesses, especially those operating in rented spaces like shopping centers, to secure loans as property cannot be used as collateral.<br><br>Bonds are also favored for their simplicity and flexibility compared to bank loans. While bank loans require detailed justification of fund usage and phased disbursement, corporate bonds offer capital with the sole obligation of repayment, without the need to prove how the funds are utilized. This flexibility makes bonds an attractive alternative for companies that can't clearly articulate their plans or simply find the bond issuance process more straightforward.<br><br>However, corporate bonds often carry higher risk. Yields typically range from five to eleven percent, but this is coupled with an increased risk of default. Estimates suggest up to twenty percent of issuers may struggle with repayment, a risk exacerbated by the current economic climate due to the coronavirus pandemic, posing a further threat to less creditworthy corporate bonds.<br><br>In Germany and France, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) now dominate the bond market, a shift from large corporations. Czech Republic has also seen a rise in corporate bond issuance by SMEs, following the trend of large firms like Škoda Auto pioneering the market in 2000.<br><br>Moore Global is a leading international network of audit and advisory firms, employing over 30,000 professionals across more than 260 independent firms in 110 countries.<br><br>press release</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_926" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_926" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_926" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_929" style="display:none;">The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic is preparing an amendment to the VAT Act to introduce mandatory electronic invoicing for all VAT payers, effective January 1, 2027. This new system will require taxpayers to issue invoices exclusively in electronic format and report invoice data to the financial administration in real-time. The goal is to digitize invoicing, reduce administrative burdens, enhance tax system transparency, and combat VAT tax evasion in the digital age through the ViDA initiative.<br><br>The proposed changes will primarily affect taxable persons based in Slovakia and transactions with a place of supply within Slovakia, including prepayments. Initially, mandatory e-invoicing will apply to domestic transactions until June 30, 2030, after which the Slovak system will integrate with the European EU DRR system for cross-border transactions. The primary tool for this electronic invoicing will be a new system called PEPPOL BiS 3.0. A unified structured electronic format, based on the STN EN 16931 standard, will be implemented.<br><br>Under the new regulations, e-invoices must be issued within 10 days of the supply of goods or services, receipt of payment before supply, or correction of the tax base. Summary e-invoices for multiple supplies in a calendar month also have a 10-day deadline from the end of that month. Recipients have 5 days from receipt to report invoice data. This reform replaces paper-based or informal electronic invoicing with a mandatory, structured electronic process.<br><br>While e-invoicing offers benefits like automation and transparency, it also presents potential drawbacks for SMEs, including technical issues, initial costs for software adaptation, security risks, reduced flexibility, and the need for enhanced IT skills. Businesses are advised to verify software compatibility, leverage direct integration with the financial administration, and train their staff for the new procedures. After July 1, 2030, the system will link with the EU DRR system, and the control and summary reports will be abolished. It's important to note that the final form of the legislation may change during parliamentary approval.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_929" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_929" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_929" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_930" style="display:none;">Reportowanie schematów podatkowych (MDR) to obowiązek informacyjny mający na celu zwalczanie agresywnej optymalizacji podatkowej i zwiększenie transparentności systemu podatkowego. Dane z MDR są analizowane przez administrację skarbową, co może prowadzić do kontroli. Aby system był skuteczny, informacje muszą być aktywnie wykorzystywane, a nie tylko gromadzone. Niewykorzystywanie danych podważa zaufanie podatników i instytucji.<br><br>Skuteczność MDR wymaga precyzyjnego kierowania kontroli, wykorzystania sztucznej inteligencji do identyfikacji ryzykownych schematów, systematycznej weryfikacji zgłoszeń oraz publikowania raportów i wytycznych. Bez tych działań MDR ryzykuje staniem się martwym przepisem. Nowelizacja przepisów w 2025 r. ma na celu dostosowanie definicji do wymogów UE, uporządkowanie kwestii tajemnicy zawodowej, wprowadzenie białej listy wyłączeń z raportowania oraz zwolnień podmiotowych.<br><br>Raportowanie krajowych schematów podatkowych, które stanowią większość zgłaszanych przypadków, jest kluczowe dla uczciwej konkurencji i uszczelnienia systemu. Mechanizmy psychologiczne, takie jak zaufanie do organów, postrzeganie sprawiedliwości i kalkulacja ryzyka, wpływają na zgodność podatkową. Brak reakcji administracji na nieraportowanie schematów zniechęca do dobrowolnego przestrzegania prawa.<br><br>Eksperci wskazują, że polskie przepisy MDR są szerokie, obejmując krajowe schematy i transakcje VAT, co może stanowić nadmierne obciążenie. Brakuje jednak kontroli i sankcji, mimo wysokich kar. Zapowiadana nowelizacja ma uprościć system, zwęzić zakres raportowania i doprecyzować definicje. Skuteczność MDR zależy od jego praktycznego wykorzystania przez administrację.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_930" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_930" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_930" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_931" style="display:none;">Employees Over 55: Companies Value Loyalty, But Prejudice and Technology Hinder Recruitment<br><br>A survey by Moore Czech Republic, in collaboration with the Association of Personnel Managers, reveals that over three-quarters of HR professionals in the Czech Republic believe employees over 55 are disadvantaged in the job market. Obstacles cited include technological adaptation, health limitations, and deeply ingrained age stereotypes. Despite these challenges, 82% of respondents acknowledge that employees aged 55 and older bring extensive work experience.<br><br>The survey, involving 101 HR professionals, found that 78% of HR experts believe older employees face disadvantages compared to their younger counterparts. Specifically, 73% consider candidates aged 55-59 to be a problem, and 90% view those 60 and over as facing significant age-related hiring barriers. Perceived drawbacks include shorter expected tenure (24%), higher salary expectations (25%), fear of workplace ageism (44%), concerns about age-related health issues (55%), and difficulty adapting to new technologies (64%). Interestingly, employees themselves confirmed these concerns, with 69.3% recognizing technology adaptation as a barrier.<br><br>Despite these hurdles, HR professionals highly value older employees for their stability and loyalty (88.1%), rich work experience (82.3%), and good communication skills (18.8%). Many see them as equally or more qualified than younger colleagues and 37.6% highlight their mentoring capabilities. However, while HR professionals suggest mentoring by younger colleagues as a support mechanism, older employees themselves prioritize increasing employer awareness of their benefits (46.5%) over such programs. They feel their know-how and contributions to workplace diversity are often undervalued.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_931" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_931" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_931" style="display:none;"></p>

      <p class="full-content" id="full_eng_932" style="display:none;">The Firm Run 2025 has concluded, leaving behind a wave of enthusiasm. This significant event, which merges athletic energy with tangible support for those in need, once again brought together tens of thousands of participants from across Poland. This year, nearly 40,000 individuals representing over 1,300 companies took part, with Moore Polska achieving a record-breaking participation of 100 representatives. The #MoorePolskaTeam collectively covered 500 kilometers, contributing to a noble cause and demonstrating that helping others is a shared priority.<br><br>The Firm Run is a nationwide initiative, organized annually by the Everest Foundation, showcasing how sports can serve a social purpose. Its online format allows participants to run or walk anywhere they choose, with the focus being on completing a 5-kilometer distance and the commitment to providing assistance. The primary objective of the Firm Run is to support children with disabilities and chronic illnesses. In this year's event, aid will be provided to 20 beneficiaries of the Everest Foundation, with the collected funds designated for their treatment, rehabilitation, and daily needs. This event fosters intergenerational connections, team integration, and highlights the profound, long-term impact even a short run can have on someone's life.<br><br>Moore Polska's involvement in the Firm Run transcends mere physical activity, representing a deliberate choice aligned with their values and social commitment. In 2025, they once again proved their collective strength, extending beyond audit and consulting projects to embrace social initiatives. While not competing for top ranks, Moore Polska employees gave their all, with the best individual time being an impressive 20 minutes and 38 seconds, and the fastest team completing the distance in 2 hours, 33 minutes, and 25 seconds. For many, it also marked the beginning of a regular fitness routine, emphasizing the importance of these personal victories. This commitment to the Firm Run is a testament to Moore Polska's ESG strategy, emphasizing responsibility and sustainable development. They believe social responsibility begins with daily decisions, which is why they actively support social, environmental, and educational initiatives, engage in equality efforts, activate local communities, and encourage employee volunteering.<br><br>The Firm Run serves as a symbol of collective effort, solidarity, and empathy. Moore Polska is proud to be part of this initiative, thanking all participants for their kilometers, dedication, and willingness to act. They look forward to seeing everyone again at the Firm Run 2026.</p><p class="full-content" id="full_jp_932" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_cn_932" style="display:none;"></p><p class="full-content" id="full_kr_932" style="display:none;"></p>
